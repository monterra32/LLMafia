Game 0687, Day 1:
 Actual Mafia: Bridget Russell, Marissa Hernandez,  
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: Marissa Hernandez, John Willis\n', "Reason: Marissa Hernandez initiated the idea of eliminating the first person on the list, which led to Alexander Rhodes being targeted. Her proactive approach in directing the vote without much discussion or evidence suggests she might be trying to control the game's outcome, a common strategy for mafia members. John Willis immediately supported Marissa's suggestion and was the first to vote for Alexander Rhodes, aligning with her without questioning or providing his reasoning. This quick agreement and coordination in voting behavior are indicative of potential mafia collaboration."]

Game 0687, Day 2:
 Actual Mafia: Bridget Russell, Marissa Hernandez,  
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: Marissa Hernandez, John Willis\n', 'Reason: \n', '1. Marissa Hernandez initiates the conversation about eliminating someone by suggesting to "Eliminate the first in list?" and then quickly votes for Alexander Rhodes. This could indicate an attempt to direct the group\'s decision-making early in the day.\n', "2. John Willis immediately supports Marissa's suggestion by saying he was thinking of the 2nd person, but then votes for Alexander Rhodes as well, aligning with Marissa's choice. This alignment could suggest coordination.\n", '3. Both Marissa and John continue to engage in the conversation, reinforcing the decision to vote out Alexander Rhodes, which could be a tactic to ensure the group follows through with their plan.\n', "4. After Alexander Rhodes is voted out, the next nighttime results in the death of Benjamin Miller. The quick agreement and push from both Marissa and John in the daytime, followed by another bystander's death at night, suggests they could be working together to eliminate threats to the mafia.\n", '5. The dialogue between Marissa and John shows a level of comfort and agreement that could indicate a deeper alliance, typical of mafia members working together to mislead other players.']

Game 0688, Day 1:
 Actual Mafia: Jay Williams, Abigail Perez,  
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: Jerry Pearson, Matthew Franco\n', 'Reason:\n', '1. **Jerry Pearson\'s Slip-Up**: Jerry Pearson made a significant slip-up by saying "Don\'t go after Jerry, he\'s just an innocent um" followed by "Mafioso!" This suggests he was about to claim innocence but accidentally revealed his true role, indicating he is likely a mafia member.\n', '\n', '2. **Matthew Franco\'s Defensive Behavior**: Matthew Franco\'s comments seem strategically defensive. He pointed out that "Too many people saying Jason, they are probably mafia," which could be an attempt to deflect suspicion from himself and cast doubt on those voting for Jason. Later, he suggested going after John or Jerry, which could be seen as trying to manipulate the focus of suspicion onto others, a common mafia tactic.\n', '\n', "3. **Voting Patterns and Accusations**: The voting pattern shows a strong push against Jason Rodriguez, which was initiated by Jason himself against Austin Williams. Jerry's vote against Jay Williams, when the majority was clearly targeting Jason, could be an attempt to appear non-aligned with the majority, a tactic sometimes used by mafia to create confusion about their alliances.\n", '\n', "4. **Interaction Dynamics**: Jerry's and Matthew's interactions and statements during the voting seem to be attempts to manipulate the direction of the game. Jerry's accidental slip and subsequent vote for Jay Williams, along with Matthew's comments about the majority being mafia and his late vote for Jerry, align with typical mafia behavior of trying to control or influence the game's narrative without drawing suspicion to themselves."]

Game 0688, Day 2:
 Actual Mafia: Jay Williams, Abigail Perez,  
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: Jerry Pearson, John Bridges\n', 'Reason:\n', '1. **Jerry Pearson\'s Suspicious Behavior**: Jerry\'s behavior during the voting and discussions is notably suspicious. He initially voted for Jay Williams when the majority was leaning towards Jason Rodriguez, which could be an attempt to divert attention from a fellow mafia member. Later, he made a slip by saying "Don\'t go after Jerry, he\'s just an innocent um" followed by "Mafioso!" which seems like a self-incriminating slip-up, possibly revealing his true role.\n', '\n', "2. **John Bridges' Voting Pattern**: John's voting pattern and statements are also indicative of mafia behavior. He voted for Jason Rodriguez only after a significant number of votes were already cast against him, which could be seen as trying to blend in with the majority to avoid suspicion. In the next round, he was quick to vote for Austin Williams and pushed for his elimination, which aligns with a typical mafia strategy of trying to eliminate non-mafia players quickly.\n", '\n', "3. **Lack of Solid Defense or Contribution**: Neither Jerry nor John provided substantial contributions or defenses during the discussions. They mostly followed or reacted to other players' suggestions without initiating much themselves, which can be a tactic used by mafia members to remain under the radar.\n", '\n', '4. **Diversion Tactics**: Both players used diversion tactics at different points. Jerry tried to cast suspicion on Jay Williams, and John supported the elimination of players who were not gathering majority votes initially, which could be a strategy to protect mafia members or confuse the bystanders.\n', '\n', "5. **Final Voting Rounds**: In the final voting rounds, both Jerry and John's actions continued to align more with trying to remove players who were actively participating in discussions (like Austin Williams), which could be a strategy to weaken the bystanders' ability to analyze and vote effectively.\n", '\n', 'These points suggest that Jerry Pearson and John Bridges were likely working together as mafia, using tactics of diversion, blending with majority votes when necessary, and making occasional slip-ups that hinted at their true roles.']

Game 0688, Day 3:
 Actual Mafia: Jay Williams, Abigail Perez,  
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: Jerry Pearson, Kelly Mclaughlin\n', 'Reason:\n', '1. **Jerry Pearson\'s Behavior**: Jerry\'s voting pattern and statements were suspicious. He voted for Jay Williams when the majority was clearly targeting Jason Rodriguez, which could be an attempt to divert attention from a fellow mafia member. Later, he made a slip by saying "Don\'t go after Jerry, he\'s just an innocent um... Mafioso!" which could have been a Freudian slip revealing his true role.\n', '\n', "2. **Kelly Mclaughlin's Actions**: Kelly's actions during the game also raise suspicion. She voted for Jason Rodriguez following the majority, which might seem normal, but her later actions suggest she was trying to manipulate the game's direction. After Jason was voted out, she quickly suggested targeting Austin Williams, aligning with the mafia's interest to eliminate non-mafia players swiftly. Her final voting against John Bridges when she was already suspected also aligns with a typical mafia strategy to create confusion.\n", '\n', '3. **Nighttime Killings**: The nighttime killings also provide some insight. After Jerry and Kelly were suspected and/or voted out, the killings in the following nights (Matthew Franco and Jerry Pearson himself) align with a scenario where the mafia might try to remove those who could potentially expose them or have started to suspect them.\n', '\n', "4. **General Game Dynamics**: The mafia's goal is to mislead and manipulate the discussions and votes. Both Jerry and Kelly's actions throughout the game fit this pattern, as they often tried to shift the focus away from themselves and onto others, a common tactic used by mafia members to survive the votes. Their inconsistent voting and accusatory behavior towards others like Jay Williams and Austin Williams further indicate their roles in trying to control the game's narrative."]

Game 0689, Day 1:
 Actual Mafia: Jesse Martin, Ricky Mcneil,  
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: Kimberly Harrison, Christopher Drake\n', 'Reason:\n', '1. **Observation of Voting Patterns**: Kimberly Harrison and Christopher Drake both voted for William Rubio, who was eventually voted out. Their voting was aligned, and they both actively participated in steering the conversation towards voting William out.\n', '\n', '2. **Analysis of Dialogue**: Both Kimberly and Christopher were active in the conversation, which can be a tactic used by mafia members to control the narrative and influence the voting decisions of other players. Kimberly\'s comment, "Looks like William isn\'t doing so hot," followed by her vote for William, suggests she was trying to solidify the group\'s focus on him.\n', '\n', '3. **Lack of Suspicion**: Neither Kimberly nor Christopher drew any suspicion towards themselves during the daytime dialogue. They managed to keep the focus on other players (primarily William Rubio), which is a common strategy used by mafia to divert attention away from themselves.\n', '\n', "4. **Final Voting Outcome**: The final vote against William Rubio was heavily influenced by the early votes and comments from Kimberly and Christopher. Their ability to guide the group's decision without drawing attention to themselves is indicative of mafia behavior, as they need to eliminate bystanders while maintaining their cover.\n", '\n', "5. **Ricky Mcneil's Behavior**: Although Ricky suggested voting out Mary Reed, he ended up voting for William Rubio, possibly influenced by the momentum built by Kimberly and Christopher. This shift could indicate that the initial suggestion to vote Mary was a diversion or a less coordinated move compared to the concerted effort to eliminate William.\n", '\n', "Given these observations, Kimberly Harrison and Christopher Drake's actions and interactions during the daytime suggest they are likely the mafia members, working together to influence the game's outcome without being detected."]

Game 0689, Day 2:
 Actual Mafia: Jesse Martin, Ricky Mcneil,  
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: Kimberly Harrison, Christopher Drake\n', 'Reason:\n', '1. **Voting Patterns and Accusations**: Kimberly Harrison and Christopher Drake both consistently voted together during the crucial moments. For instance, they both voted for William Rubio when he was a popular choice, and later both targeted Ricky Mcneil when it was less clear who the majority was leaning towards. This suggests they were coordinating their votes.\n', '\n', "2. **Deflection and Influence**: Kimberly Harrison was very active in influencing the group's decisions, often echoing sentiments that would sway the group's opinion (e.g., pointing out that William Rubio wasn't participating much, which could be seen as trying to justify her vote against him). Christopher Drake also played a role in steering conversations, such as suggesting that Ricky Mcneil was too eager to kick people out, which could be a tactic to remove suspicion from himself and direct it towards someone else.\n", '\n', "3. **Survival and Manipulation**: Both Kimberly Harrison and Christopher Drake survived multiple rounds of voting without being seriously considered as suspects by other players, which indicates they were successful in manipulating the group's perception. Their ability to remain under the radar, while actively participating and shaping the dialogue, is characteristic of mafia behavior in such games.\n", '\n', '4. **Nighttime Killings Alignment**: The nighttime killings of Mary Blake and Mary Reed did not implicate Kimberly or Christopher directly, but their survival and the subsequent shifting of suspicion away from themselves the next day align with mafia tactics of removing threats or silent players who might be observing patterns.\n', '\n', "5. **Lack of Accusation Towards Each Other**: Throughout the game, neither Kimberly nor Christopher accused each other or voted against each other, which could indicate a mafia alliance trying to keep both members safe from the group's suspicion."]

Game 0689, Day 3:
 Actual Mafia: Jesse Martin, Ricky Mcneil,  
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: Ricky Mcneil, Jeffrey Miles\n', 'Reason:\n', "1. **Ricky Mcneil's Behavior**: Ricky was very eager to vote out other players, specifically targeting William Rubio and Kimberly Harrison. His aggressive approach to voting and his attempts to direct the group's decisions are typical of mafia behavior, trying to eliminate threats or shift suspicion away from themselves.\n", '\n', "2. **Jeffrey Miles' Voting Pattern**: Jeffrey's voting was not aligned with the majority and seemed to target individuals who were not under general suspicion, such as voting for Kimberly Harrison when the majority was leaning towards Ricky Mcneil. This could indicate an attempt to divert attention from his mafia partner or himself.\n", '\n', '3. **Nighttime Killings Post-Voting**: After Ricky Mcneil was voted out, Kimberly Harrison, who was active in voting against Ricky, was killed during the night. This suggests that the remaining mafia wanted to retaliate against those who were instrumental in voting out their partner.\n', '\n', '4. **General Suspicion and Accusations**: Both Ricky and Jeffrey were frequently mentioned and voted against in discussions, indicating a general suspicion among other players regarding their behavior and voting patterns.\n', '\n', "5. **Final Voting Patterns**: Jeffrey Miles continued to vote differently from the group consensus in the final rounds, which aligns with typical mafia behavior trying to mislead the group's decision-making process. His elimination led to the end of the game, confirming his role as mafia."]

Game 0689, Day 4:
 Actual Mafia: Jesse Martin, Ricky Mcneil,  
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: Jesse Martin, Rebecca Patterson\n', 'Reason:\n', '1. **Nighttime Kill Analysis**: After each nighttime, the players killed (Mary Blake, Mary Reed, Kimberly Harrison, Christopher Drake) do not include Jesse or Rebecca, suggesting they might be mafia, as mafia members typically avoid killing each other.\n', '\n', '2. **Voting Patterns and Accusations**:\n', '   - **Jesse Martin**:\n', '     - Day 1: Votes for Mary Reed, a bystander, instead of joining the majority against William Rubio.\n', '     - Day 2: Votes for Rebecca Patterson when the majority is against Ricky Mcneil, possibly to appear unsynchronized with mafia.\n', '     - Day 3: Votes for Rebecca Patterson again when the majority is against Jeffrey Miles, continuing the pattern of voting against the flow to appear innocent.\n', '     - Day 4: Votes for Jeremiah Johnson, aligning with the final vote to eliminate another bystander.\n', '   - **Rebecca Patterson**:\n', '     - Day 1: Votes for William Rubio, aligning with the majority, which could be a strategy to blend in.\n', '     - Day 2: Votes for Ricky Mcneil, following the majority which is a common tactic to remain under the radar.\n', '     - Day 3: Votes for Jeffrey Miles, again following the majority.\n', '     - Day 4: Votes for Jeremiah Johnson, aligning with the final vote to eliminate another bystander.\n', '\n', '3. **Behavioral Analysis**:\n', '   - **Jesse Martin** often votes against the majority trend initially, which could be a tactic to mislead the bystanders about his identity. His final votes often align with eliminating non-mafia players.\n', '   - **Rebecca Patterson** consistently follows the majority, which might be a strategy to avoid suspicion. Her interactions and voting seem designed to not draw attention.\n', '\n', '4. **Final Stages**:\n', '   - Jesse\'s comment, "Hopefully Rebecca doesn\'t kill me," at the end of the game could be seen as a playful banter between mafia members when they know they are the only ones left, thus ensuring their victory.\n', '\n', "Given these observations, Jesse Martin and Rebecca Patterson's actions align with typical mafia behavior of blending in, misdirecting during votes, and ultimately surviving till the end of the game."]

Game 0690, Day 1:
 Actual Mafia: Danielle Moore, Janice Estrada,  
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: Justin Scott, Shane Bell\n', 'Reason:\n', "1. **Justin Scott's Early Accusation**: Justin Scott was quick to suggest letting Christopher go home, which could be seen as an attempt to direct suspicion towards Christopher early in the day without a solid basis.\n", '\n', "2. **Shane Bell's Voting Behavior**: Shane Bell immediately voted for Justin Scott after Justin's comment, which might seem like distancing behavior, a common tactic used by mafia members to appear unaligned with each other.\n", '\n', '3. **Christopher Diaz\'s Reaction**: Christopher\'s comment "Kill me lol" and his vote against Shane Bell suggest he might have suspected Shane as being against him, possibly due to Shane\'s initial vote against Justin and later behavior.\n', '\n', "4. **Voting Pattern and Comments**: The majority of the players voted for Christopher Diaz, likely following the early narrative set by Justin. Shane Bell, however, voted differently (for Aaron), which could be an attempt to appear as if he's not following the majority (controlled by mafia) or to sow discord.\n", '\n', "5. **Outcome and Mafia Tactics**: The mafia would benefit from removing suspicion from themselves by orchestrating the vote against a non-mafia player like Christopher. Justin's early push and Shane's contrary voting could be a strategy to manipulate the voting while maintaining the appearance of disagreement among themselves.\n", '\n', '6. **Lack of Defense for Christopher**: Neither Justin nor Shane made any attempt to defend Christopher, which might indicate their interest in seeing him voted out, aligning with mafia goals.\n', '\n', "Given these observations, Justin Scott and Shane Bell's actions align with typical mafia behavior, suggesting they are the mafia members in this game."]

Game 0690, Day 2:
 Actual Mafia: Danielle Moore, Janice Estrada,  
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: Justin Scott, Shane Bell\n', 'Reason:\n', "1. **Justin Scott's Early Accusation**: Justin Scott was quick to suggest letting Christopher go home right after the night ended, which could be an attempt to direct suspicion away from himself and onto Christopher.\n", '\n', "2. **Shane Bell's Voting Behavior**: Shane Bell immediately voted for Justin Scott after Justin's suggestion, which might seem like a disagreement among bystanders. However, this could also be a tactic used by mafia members to create confusion and appear as if they are not aligned.\n", '\n', '3. **Christopher Diaz\'s Behavior**: Christopher\'s comments like "Kill me lol" and voting for Shane Bell, along with his casual acceptance of being targeted ("ty", "I\'m hit!"), suggest he might have been a resigned bystander, knowing he was being framed or genuinely found suspicious by others.\n', '\n', '4. **Outcome of Votes**: The majority of the votes went to Christopher Diaz, which included votes from Justin Scott and other players. Shane Bell, however, voted differently (for Aaron, not mentioned by others), which could be a strategy to appear less aligned with the majority and thus less suspicious.\n', '\n', "5. **Nighttime Killings**: After Christopher was voted out, the next nighttime killing was Lucas Richardson. If Justin and Shane were mafia, they would continue to eliminate threats or those who might suspect them next. Lucas might have been seen as a threat or simply the next in line who wasn't aligned with them.\n", '\n', "6. **Lack of Defensive Play for Justin and Shane**: Neither Justin nor Shane seemed to defend themselves robustly or provide alternatives, which is often a tactic used by mafia members to keep the suspicion off themselves while subtly directing the game's flow.\n", '\n', "7. **General Observation**: The mafia would benefit from sowing discord and misdirection. Justin's initial push against Christopher and Shane's immediate contrary vote could be seen as an attempt to create a chaotic voting environment, making it easier to manipulate subsequent votes."]

Game 0690, Day 3:
 Actual Mafia: Danielle Moore, Janice Estrada,  
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: Justin Scott, Danielle Moore\n', 'Reason:\n', "1. **Justin Scott's Early Accusation**: Justin Scott was quick to suggest voting out Christopher Diaz early in the game, which is a common tactic used by mafia to direct suspicion away from themselves.\n", '\n', '2. **Voting Patterns**: Both Justin Scott and Danielle Moore consistently voted together against the same individuals (Christopher Diaz and Aaron Horton), which could indicate coordination. Mafia members often vote together to ensure their targets are eliminated.\n', '\n', '3. **Survival and Kill Pattern**: Notably, Justin Scott and Danielle Moore survived multiple rounds without being targeted at night by the mafia, which is suspicious as mafia members do not kill their own. This pattern of survival while other players like Lucas Richardson and Barry Dunn were killed during the night raises suspicion.\n', '\n', "4. **Influence on Other Players**: Justin Scott and Danielle Moore seemed to have influenced other players' votes or the direction of the game. For example, after Justin's initial push, other players followed in voting against Christopher Diaz and later Aaron Horton.\n", '\n', '5. **Lack of Accusation Towards Each Other**: Throughout the game dialogue, neither Justin Scott nor Danielle Moore accused each other or voted against each other, which is typical behavior for mafia members who aim to keep each other in the game.\n', '\n', '6. **Final Rounds**: In the final rounds, their continued survival and the pattern of their voting targeting specific individuals further solidify the suspicion. Their actions in the game align with typical mafia strategies of manipulation and avoiding drawing suspicion on themselves while methodically eliminating bystanders.']

Game 0691, Day 1:
 Actual Mafia: Daniel Humphrey, Paul Silva,  
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: Richard Johnson, Paul Silva\n', 'Reason:\n', "1. **Early Voting and Accusation**: Richard Johnson quickly accused Kimberly Sullivan without much discussion, which is a common tactic used by mafia to deflect suspicion from themselves. This is pointed out by Kimberly herself, suggesting that Richard's quick accusation is a sign of being mafia.\n", '\n', "2. **Voting Pattern and Defense**: Paul Silva immediately supported the vote against Kimberly Sullivan after she defended herself and pointed out Richard's suspicious behavior. This could indicate that Paul is working with Richard to eliminate those who suspect them, aligning their actions to protect each other.\n", '\n', "3. **Agreement without Reason**: Paul Silva agreed with Kimberly's suspicion towards Richard but still voted against Kimberly. This contradictory behavior could be a strategy to appear agreeable or neutral while still pushing the mafia's agenda.\n", '\n', '4. **Lack of Solid Defense**: Neither Richard nor Paul provided a solid defense or reasoning for their actions beyond agreeing with accusations or making vague statements, which is often seen in mafia players trying to avoid drawing attention to their lack of valid reasoning.\n', '\n', '5. **Outcome of the Vote**: The successful elimination of Kimberly Sullivan, despite her logical defense and pointing out suspicious behavior, suggests that the mafia might have influenced the vote significantly. Given that Richard and Paul were instrumental in directing the vote against her, it supports the theory that they could be mafia working together.']

Game 0691, Day 2:
 Actual Mafia: Daniel Humphrey, Paul Silva,  
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: Richard Johnson, Megan Jackson\n', 'Reason:\n', "1. Richard Johnson's early accusation against Kimberly Sullivan without prior discussion raised suspicions among other players, as pointed out by Daniel Humphrey and Paul Silva. This behavior is typical of mafia trying to shift focus and create chaos.\n", '\n', "2. Megan Jackson's voting pattern supports Richard Johnson's accusations, particularly against Kimberly Sullivan. She voted for Kimberly shortly after Richard did, which could indicate a coordinated effort to eliminate a non-mafia player.\n", '\n', '3. After Kimberly Sullivan was voted out and subsequently Erica Joseph was killed during the night, the focus shifted back to Richard Johnson, who continued to make defensive and vague statements, further raising suspicion about his role.\n', '\n', "4. The fact that Richard Johnson was one of the first to vote and was comfortable with making accusations aligns with Daniel Humphrey's observation about his comfort with the user interface, suggesting he might be more experienced or bold as a mafia player.\n", '\n', "5. Megan Jackson's relatively low profile and quick alignment with Richard Johnson's voting decisions without contributing much to the discussion could indicate a strategy often used by mafia members to stay under the radar while supporting their fellow mafia's moves."]

Game 0691, Day 3:
 Actual Mafia: Daniel Humphrey, Paul Silva,  
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: Richard Johnson, Megan Jackson\n', 'Reason:\n', '1. Richard Johnson was very quick to make accusations and vote without much discussion, which is a common mafia tactic to deflect suspicion from themselves. He first accused Kimberly Sullivan and then voted for her immediately, which led to her being voted out. This behavior is suspicious as it shows a willingness to push for a vote without proper consensus or discussion.\n', '\n', "2. Megan Jackson's voting pattern and minimal participation in discussions also raise suspicion. She voted for Kimberly Sullivan along with Richard, which could indicate they were working together to eliminate a non-mafia player. Additionally, Megan's interaction in the game is less proactive, which might be a strategy to avoid drawing attention to herself while supporting her mafia partner's decisions.\n", '\n', "3. After Richard Johnson was voted out, the game continued, indicating that at least one mafia member was still active. Given Megan Jackson's alignment with Richard's decisions and her low-profile behavior, it suggests she could be the other mafia trying to stay under the radar.\n", '\n', "4. The nighttime killings followed a pattern that did not implicate Megan directly but aligned with the mafia's interest in removing those who could potentially influence the game against them. The choice of victims and the timing of votes also support the theory that Megan, along with Richard, was strategically manipulating the game's outcomes."]

Game 0692, Day 1:
 Actual Mafia: Dr. Kelli Brooks, Bob Woods,  
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: Matthew Bridges, Ernest Nguyen\n', 'Reason:\n', '1. Matthew Bridges was the first to vote, and he chose Bob Woods without any prior discussion or reason. This early, random vote can be a tactic used by mafia to create chaos and suspicion among bystanders.\n', '2. James Lopez pointed out that it seemed odd for Matthew to make the first choice, suggesting he might be mafia. This observation led to multiple players, including James, Dr. Kelli Brooks, Blake Gordon, Bob Woods, and Bryan Castillo, voting against Matthew, indicating a general suspicion towards him.\n', "3. Ernest Nguyen's behavior during the voting was peculiar. He voted for Blake Gordon, diverting attention from Matthew and himself, which could be a strategy to protect another mafia member or confuse the voting pattern.\n", '4. Ernest\'s comment, "first is always safe its second," seems to be an attempt to create a misleading rule or pattern to influence future votes and discussions. This could be a tactic to manipulate the game\'s flow and protect himself or another mafia member in future rounds.\n', "5. The collective voting against Matthew and his subsequent elimination, coupled with Ernest's odd behavior and statements, suggest that Matthew was likely mafia, and Ernest could be his mafia partner trying to manipulate the game dynamics."]

Game 0692, Day 2:
 Actual Mafia: Dr. Kelli Brooks, Bob Woods,  
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: Bob Woods, Blake Gordon\n', 'Reason:\n', '1. **Bob Woods** was initially voted for by Matthew Bridges, which seemed random. However, Bob\'s reaction and subsequent dialogue ("that would be a mistake...") could be interpreted as trying to deflect suspicion early on. His later interactions, particularly his laughter and nonchalant attitude ("lol") when serious accusations or votes are happening, suggest he might be trying to downplay the situation to avoid suspicion.\n', '\n', '2. **Blake Gordon**\'s behavior is less overtly suspicious, but his voting pattern and interactions raise some red flags. He voted for Matthew Bridges along with a majority, which could be seen as a safe play to blend in. His later interactions, especially laughing ("lol") during serious discussions about who might be mafia, suggest a possible attempt to minimize the tension and seriousness of the situation, which can be a tactic to deflect suspicion.\n', '\n', "3. The voting patterns also provide some insight. Both Bob and Blake voted in ways that aligned with trying to remove suspicion from themselves. For instance, Bob voted for Matthew Bridges after a majority had already formed, which is a common mafia tactic to appear as part of the town. Blake's vote for Kathryn Reid when she was not a major suspect also stands out as potentially trying to shift focus or eliminate someone who might suspect him.\n", '\n', '4. The nighttime killings also offer some clues. After Matthew Bridges, who was a strong accuser of Bob, was voted out, James Lopez, who voted against Matthew and showed suspicion, was killed during the night. This could indicate that the mafia wanted to remove those who were actively participating and shaping the discussions, which mafia players like Bob and Blake would see as beneficial for reducing suspicion on themselves.\n', '\n', '5. Lastly, the dialogue and reactions during the votes and accusations against Ernest Nguyen and Kathryn Reid show Bob and Blake in a non-serious light, often laughing or making jokes, which could be a strategy to keep the mood light and avoid serious scrutiny of their actions.']

Game 0692, Day 3:
 Actual Mafia: Dr. Kelli Brooks, Bob Woods,  
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: Bob Woods, Bryan Castillo\n', 'Reason:\n', "1. **Bob Woods' Early Voting and Influence**: Bob Woods was one of the first to vote during the first daytime session, targeting Matthew Bridges. His early vote and subsequent influence in discussions could indicate an attempt to direct the group's decisions, a common mafia tactic.\n", '\n', "2. **Survival Despite Suspicion**: Bob Woods was repeatedly voted against but never eliminated, suggesting he might have been manipulating the group's opinion to keep himself safe. His consistent survival, despite being a target, raises suspicion.\n", '\n', "3. **Bryan Castillo's Low Profile and Voting Pattern**: Bryan Castillo maintained a relatively low profile throughout the game, which is often a strategy used by the mafia to avoid drawing attention. His voting pattern aligns with Bob Woods in critical moments, supporting Bob's choices, which could indicate a mafia alliance.\n", '\n', '4. **Nighttime Killings Post-Voting**: After key players like Matthew Bridges and James Lopez, who were vocal against Bob Woods, were voted out, they were killed during the subsequent night. This pattern suggests that the mafia, possibly including Bob, was removing those who opposed or suspected him during the daytime.\n', '\n', "5. **Final Stages of the Game**: In the later stages, Bob Woods' continued influence in voting and his push to vote out Blake Gordon, aligning with Bryan Castillo's votes, further supports the theory that they were working together as mafia, controlling the flow of the game and eliminating threats to their survival."]

Game 0693, Day 1:
 Actual Mafia: Natalie Velasquez, Kevin Morales,  
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: Natalie Velasquez, Stephen Baldwin\n', 'Reason:\n', "1. **Stephen Baldwin's Behavior**: Stephen Baldwin's comments and behavior during the discussion were suspicious. He made a joke about making his own mob out of bystanders, which could be seen as a slip revealing his mafia role. Additionally, his quickness to vote for Natalie Velasquez after she was accused and his attempt to deflect attention by joking about getting the party started are typical mafia tactics to confuse the other players.\n", '\n', "2. **Natalie Velasquez's Reaction**: Natalie's behavior was also indicative of being a mafia member. She agreed with the vote against herself, which is unusual unless it's a strategy to appear innocent or reverse psychology. Her lack of defense and the quick agreement on her own suspicion raised red flags.\n", '\n', "3. **Voting Patterns and Accusations**: The voting pattern showed a division where some players suspected Stephen Baldwin, while others went for Natalie Velasquez. Stephen's and Natalie's interactions and the way accusations were handled between them suggest a possible collusion or at least a shared interest in directing the game's flow, typical of mafia members trying to control the narrative.\n", '\n', "4. **Player Observations**: Other players like Dr. Christopher Hamilton and Nathan Pham pointed out the suspicious nature of both Stephen's and Natalie's comments and actions. This external observation by other players supports the theory that both were working together to manipulate the game, indicative of mafia behavior.\n", '\n', 'Given these observations, it is likely that Stephen Baldwin and Natalie Velasquez were the mafia members in this game.']

Game 0693, Day 2:
 Actual Mafia: Natalie Velasquez, Kevin Morales,  
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: Stephen Baldwin, Kevin Morales\n', 'Reason:\n', "1. Stephen Baldwin was quickly accused by Dr. Christopher Hamilton of having mob connections, which could be a playful accusation but also a subtle hint based on Baldwin's behavior.\n", '2. Stephen Baldwin made a suspicious comment about making his own mob out of bystanders, which could be interpreted as a slip revealing his mafia role.\n', '3. Stephen Baldwin was very active in pushing for Natalie Velasquez to be voted out, which could be a strategy to divert attention from himself.\n', '4. Kevin Morales was voted for by Aaron Vaughan, who was then killed in the night, suggesting that Kevin might be trying to eliminate those who suspect him.\n', '5. Nathan Pham pointed out that Aaron wanted Kevin Morales gone, which aligns with the pattern of mafia members trying to remove those who are onto them.\n', '6. The dialogue and voting patterns suggest that Stephen Baldwin and Kevin Morales were working together to manipulate the votes and discussions, typical of mafia behavior in the game.']

Game 0693, Day 3:
 Actual Mafia: Natalie Velasquez, Kevin Morales,  
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: Natalie Velasquez, Nathan Pham\n', 'Reason:\n', '1. **Natalie Velasquez** was suspected early in the game by multiple players including Stephen Baldwin and Nathan Pham. Despite her attempts to defend herself, the suspicion against her was strong, and she was eventually voted out. Nathan Pham later confirms that Natalie was indeed a member of the mafia, which aligns with the suspicions and her eventual elimination by the group.\n', '\n', '2. **Nathan Pham** was actively involved in the discussions and voting against Natalie, which might seem like a strategy to distance himself from another mafia member to avoid suspicion. This tactic is often used by mafia members to appear innocent. His behavior and arguments during the discussions, especially his defensive stance when suspected by others like Latoya Carter and Dr. Christopher Hamilton, suggest he was trying to manipulate the situation. His insistence that voting against Natalie proved his innocence could be seen as an attempt to mislead the others, a common mafia tactic to create confusion and shift suspicion away from themselves.\n', '\n', "3. The elimination of **Nathan Pham** towards the end, after Natalie was confirmed as mafia, and the continued suspicion towards him by other players like Dr. Christopher Hamilton and Kevin Morales, further supports the idea that he was the second mafia. His arguments and the pattern of voting also align with typical mafia behavior, trying to eliminate threats and manipulate the game's direction."]

 Actual Mafia: Natalie Velasquez, Kevin Morales,  
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: Natalie Velasquez, Kevin Morales\n', 'Reason:\n', '1. **Natalie Velasquez** was suspected early in the game by multiple players including Stephen Baldwin and Nathan Pham. Stephen Baldwin\'s accusation was supported by Christine King and Nathan Pham, leading to a consensus that Natalie might be mafia. This suspicion was further validated when Natalie herself made a slip by saying "Natalie can\'t be trusted," which is an unusual statement for someone to make about themselves unless it\'s a slip-up revealing her true role. Ultimately, Natalie was voted out, and later Nathan Pham confirmed that Natalie was indeed a member of the mafia.\n', '\n', "2. **Kevin Morales** was implicated by Aaron Vaughan's vote before Aaron was killed in the night. This suggests that Aaron might have suspected Kevin of being mafia, and the mafia then targeted Aaron to silence him. Additionally, Nathan Pham later suggested that Kevin might be mafia because Aaron had wanted Kevin gone. This suspicion towards Kevin persisted and was supported by Nancy Foley and Latoya Carter towards the end of the game. Kevin's behavior in the dialogues, especially his defensive and accusatory stance, aligns with typical mafia behavior trying to deflect suspicion. Kevin was eventually voted out, and the game dialogues following his elimination suggest that the mafia was correctly identified."]

Game 0694, Day 1:
 Actual Mafia: Monica Sweeney, Felicia Schwartz,  
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: Felicia Schwartz, Colin Case\n', 'Reason:\n', '1. **Voting Patterns and Accusations**: The voting pattern and the accusations made during the daytime provide significant clues. Curtis Lawrence received the majority of votes, leading to his elimination. However, the dialogue and accusations surrounding Felicia Schwartz and Colin Case are particularly telling.\n', '   \n', "2. **Colin Case's Actions**: Colin Case voted for Felicia Schwartz initially, which could be seen as an attempt to deflect suspicion from himself by not aligning his vote with other suspected mafia members. However, his later actions and statements raise suspicion. After Benjamin Wright accuses Felicia of being mafia, Colin quickly agrees with Benjamin, which might be an attempt to appear aligned with the bystanders once suspicion on Felicia escalates.\n", '\n', "3. **Benjamin Wright's Accusation**: Benjamin Wright directly accuses Felicia Schwartz of being mafia. This accusation is crucial because it shifts some focus onto Felicia, and the reaction to this accusation is important. Colin's quick agreement with Benjamin's accusation could be a strategic move to distance himself from his fellow mafia member once he feels the majority is leaning towards believing Benjamin's claim.\n", '\n', '4. **Felicia Schwartz\'s Voting and Responses**: Felicia votes for Curtis Lawrence, aligning with the majority which could be a tactic to blend in. Her question "is he the mafioso?" when voting could be seen as an attempt to appear genuinely curious and confused, a common tactic used by mafia players to sow doubt about their own alignment.\n', '\n', "5. **General Observations**: The interactions and quick shifts in voting and accusations, particularly by Colin and Felicia, suggest they might be coordinating or reacting in a way to protect their standing in the game. Colin's behavior of initially voting differently and then quickly supporting an accusation against Felicia when she becomes a more likely target suggests mafia behavior of trying to manage suspicion levels strategically.\n", '\n', "Based on these observations, Felicia Schwartz and Colin Case's actions and reactions during the voting and accusations are indicative of mafia behavior, attempting to manipulate the flow of the game and suspicion levels to their advantage."]

Game 0694, Day 2:
 Actual Mafia: Monica Sweeney, Felicia Schwartz,  
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: Benjamin Wright, Tyler Howell\n', 'Reason:\n', "1. **Voting Patterns and Accusations**: Benjamin Wright and Tyler Howell both consistently voted against Curtis Lawrence and Felicia Schwartz, who were eventually voted out. Their voting was aligned, and they supported each other's accusations.\n", '\n', '2. **Behavior During Accusations**: Benjamin Wright was quick to accuse Felicia Schwartz of being mafia ("Felicia is mafioso") without substantial evidence presented in the dialogue. This could be a tactic to deflect suspicion from himself.\n', '\n', "3. **Reaction to Curtis Lawrence's Defense**: When Curtis Lawrence defended himself, stating he was not mafia, Benjamin did not engage with his defense but continued to push for Felicia's guilt. This suggests a possible attempt to eliminate non-mafia players.\n", '\n', "4. **Nighttime Killings**: After Curtis Lawrence was voted out, Danny Owens was killed during the night. Benjamin and Tyler's focus then shifted to Felicia, suggesting they might be trying to systematically remove those they consider threats or those who could potentially expose them.\n", '\n', '5. **Interaction with Other Players**: Tyler Howell\'s interactions, such as his casual remarks ("lol", "Curtis lives!", "only in our dreams") and his quick alignment with Benjamin\'s accusations, suggest a coordinated effort to manipulate the group\'s perception and decisions.\n', '\n', "6. **Final Voting**: In the final voting where Felicia Schwartz was voted out, both Benjamin and Tyler voted for her, despite the ongoing discussion and confusion among other players about the rationale behind the vote. This shows a continued pattern of targeting specific players, likely to ensure the mafia's numerical advantage.\n", '\n', 'These points suggest that Benjamin Wright and Tyler Howell were working together with consistent voting patterns, strategic accusations, and behavior that aligns with typical mafia tactics in such social deduction games.']

Game 0694, Day 3:
 Actual Mafia: Monica Sweeney, Felicia Schwartz,  
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: Benjamin Wright, Colin Case\n', 'Reason:\n', '1. **Voting Patterns and Accusations**: Benjamin Wright and Colin Case consistently voted together against Curtis Lawrence and Felicia Schwartz, who were both eventually voted out. Their coordination in voting suggests they were working together, which is typical of mafia members trying to eliminate non-mafia players.\n', '\n', '2. **Defensive Behavior**: Benjamin Wright accused Felicia Schwartz of being mafia ("Felicia is mafioso") without substantial evidence presented in the dialogue. This tactic is often used by mafia members to deflect suspicion from themselves and onto innocent bystanders.\n', '\n', '3. **Nighttime Killings**: After Curtis Lawrence and Felicia Schwartz were voted out, the nighttime killings continued, indicating that at least one of the voted-out players was not mafia. Since Benjamin and Colin pushed hard for their elimination, it suggests they were trying to remove non-mafia players.\n', '\n', '4. **Final Voting**: In the final rounds, Benjamin Wright and Colin Case again voted together, this time against Justin Johnson, further showing their consistent alliance throughout the game. Their ability to steer the votes towards their chosen targets without drawing suspicion on themselves aligns with mafia behavior.\n', '\n', "5. **General Influence and Manipulation**: Throughout the game, Benjamin Wright appears to be leading discussions and influencing voting decisions, a common strategy used by mafia members to control the flow of the game and eliminate threats to their survival. Colin Case supports and reinforces Benjamin's positions, suggesting a collaborative effort typical of mafia teammates."]

Game 0694, Day 4:
 Actual Mafia: Monica Sweeney, Felicia Schwartz,  
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: Benjamin Wright, Colin Case\n', 'Reason:\n', '1. **Voting Patterns and Accusations**: Benjamin Wright and Colin Case consistently voted together against the same targets (Felicia Schwartz and Justin Johnson) in the later stages of the game. This pattern suggests they were coordinating their votes to eliminate non-mafia players.\n', '\n', '2. **Defensive Behavior**: Benjamin Wright accused Felicia Schwartz of being mafia ("Felicia is mafioso") without substantial evidence, which is a common tactic used by mafia members to deflect suspicion from themselves.\n', '\n', "3. **Nighttime Killings**: After Curtis Lawrence was voted out, Danny Owens was killed during the night. Benjamin Wright's immediate vote against Felicia the next day suggests an attempt to quickly remove another player who might suspect him, indicating mafia behavior.\n", '\n', '4. **Final Stages**: In the final stages, Benjamin Wright and Colin Case quickly voted for Justin Johnson, showing a pattern of trying to eliminate players swiftly, which is typical of mafia trying to end the game before they are outnumbered.\n', '\n', "5. **Outcome of Nighttime Killings**: After Felicia Schwartz was voted out, Tyler Howell was killed during the night. The next day, Benjamin Wright tried to direct the remaining players' suspicions towards Justin Johnson, further indicating his role in trying to manipulate the game's outcome.\n", '\n', "6. **Benjamin's Death**: Benjamin Wright was killed in the night after Justin Johnson was voted out, which might seem to contradict him being mafia. However, considering all previous actions and patterns, it's likely that his fellow mafia member, Colin Case, might have killed him to confuse the remaining players and avoid suspicion, a strategy sometimes used in the endgame to mislead the final player(s)."]

Game 0695, Day 1:
 Actual Mafia: Mike Burton, William Holmes,  
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: Sandra Reese, Rodney Maynard\n', 'Reason:\n', '1. **Voting Patterns and Accusations**: Sandra Reese and Rodney Maynard both voted for Sharon Parker, who was eventually voted out. Voting out a bystander is a common mafia tactic to reduce the number of bystanders.\n', '\n', '2. **Defensive Statements**: Both Sandra and Rodney made overt statements about being bystanders, which can be a tactic used by mafia members to deflect suspicion. Sandra said, "I\'m a bystander...and a girl, I guess," and Rodney said, "I\'m a bystander too. Girl named Rodney lol." These statements can be seen as attempts to appear innocent.\n', '\n', '3. **Lack of Suspicion**: Neither Sandra nor Rodney were significantly suspected or accused by others during the day, which might indicate they were successfully diverting attention away from themselves.\n', '\n', "4. **Reaction to Accusations**: When Sandra was voted for by Judith Sharp and Mike Burton, her response was to vote for Sharon Parker, aligning with Rodney's vote, which could indicate a mafia strategy to shift the focus and votes towards another player.\n", '\n', "5. **General Behavior**: Rodney's and Sandra's interactions and voting seemed coordinated, especially in the critical moment when they both voted for Sharon Parker, leading to her elimination. This coordination could suggest a mafia alliance trying to control the vote outcome.\n", '\n', "Based on these observations, Sandra Reese and Rodney Maynard's actions align with typical mafia behavior in trying to manipulate the game's outcome by eliminating bystanders and deflecting suspicion from themselves."]

Game 0695, Day 2:
 Actual Mafia: Mike Burton, William Holmes,  
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: Rodney Maynard, William Holmes\n', 'Reason:\n', "1. **Rodney Maynard's behavior**: Rodney's voting pattern and comments are suspicious. He voted for Sharon Parker after William Holmes pointed out that Sharon hadn't answered, which seems like a coordinated effort to eliminate a bystander. Later, Rodney quickly agrees to vote for Scott Thomas, following the lead of others without much hesitation or defense, which could indicate mafia trying to push suspicion away from themselves.\n", '\n', '2. **William Holmes\' behavior**: William initiates the vote against Sharon Parker, which leads to her elimination. This could be seen as an attempt to remove a bystander. His quick decision to vote for Scott Thomas in the next round, followed by his insistence and lack of sympathy ("I\'m not sorry"), also aligns with mafia behavior trying to control the flow of the game and eliminate threats.\n', '\n', '3. **Outcome of night actions**: After Sharon Parker was voted out, Sandra Reese was killed during the night. Rodney\'s comment the next day, "We got one of our own :(", could be interpreted as a slip, suggesting he knew Sharon was not mafia, thus confirming his mafia role. The mafia would know the roles of those killed at night.\n', '\n', "4. **General suspicion and dynamics**: Throughout the game, Rodney and William seem to be steering the group's decisions without drawing much suspicion towards themselves, a common tactic used by experienced mafia players to control the game's narrative.\n", '\n', '5. **Scott Thomas\' defense**: Scott vehemently denies being mafia, and the intensity of his defense ("Don\'t do it.. I\'m really not a Mafia.") could be genuine, suggesting he was indeed a bystander being framed by actual mafia members, possibly Rodney and William.']

Game 0695, Day 3:
 Actual Mafia: Mike Burton, William Holmes,  
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: Rodney Maynard, William Holmes\n', 'Reason:\n', "1. **Rodney Maynard's behavior**: Rodney's voting pattern and comments are suspicious. He voted for Sharon Parker after William Holmes pointed out that Sharon hadn't answered, which seems like a coordinated effort to eliminate a bystander. Later, Rodney quickly agreed to vote for Scott Thomas when others started suspecting him, which could be an attempt to deflect suspicion from himself.\n", '\n', '2. **William Holmes\' behavior**: William was quick to vote for Sharon Parker, leading the charge against her, which could be a tactic to remove a bystander. His immediate vote against Scott Thomas in the subsequent round, followed by his insistence on Scott being mafia ("Yea, I agree"), also points towards a strategy to eliminate non-mafia players swiftly.\n', '\n', '3. **Nighttime killings align with their survival**: After Sharon Parker and Scott Thomas, both voted out during the day, were eliminated, the nighttime killings of Sandra Reese and Judith Sharp followed. Both Rodney and William survived these rounds, which could indicate their involvement in choosing who gets killed at night, ensuring their survival and the elimination of bystanders.\n', '\n', '4. **General suspicion and deflection**: Both Rodney and William engaged in deflecting suspicion from themselves and were quick to agree on voting out others suggested by players, which is a common mafia tactic to blend in with the bystander majority.\n', '\n', '5. **Final rounds**: The final rounds of voting and the nighttime killings suggest a pattern where those suspected or voted out during the day were not mafia, as the game continued with mafia killings at night, implicating those who were leading the charges against the voted-out players, particularly Rodney and William.']

Game 0696, Day 1:
 Actual Mafia: Mr. Michael Nelson Jr., Julian Barrett,  
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: Mr. Michael Nelson Jr., Nathan Lynch\n', 'Reason:\n', '1. **Mr. Michael Nelson Jr.** was very quick to accuse Julian Barrett without any substantial evidence, which is a common tactic used by mafia members to divert attention from themselves. His reasoning that Julian\'s name "sounds like a mobish name" is not based on any concrete gameplay or interaction, indicating a possible attempt to manipulate the vote.\n', '\n', "2. **Nathan Lynch** also displayed suspicious behavior by quickly jumping on the bandwagon to vote against Julian initially, but then swiftly changing his target to Mr. Michael Nelson Jr. when others started suspecting Michael. This kind of flip-flopping can be indicative of mafia trying to blend in with the majority once they realize their initial plan isn't working.\n", '\n', '3. The dialogue between Nathan and Michael shows a pattern of trying to control the narrative of the game. Nathan\'s comment about Michael having "too many names" and calling him "mobbed up" seems more like a playful banter rather than genuine suspicion, which could be a tactic to confuse the other players.\n', '\n', '4. The voting pattern also supports the suspicion. When pressure mounted on Mr. Michael Nelson Jr., Nathan Lynch voted for him, possibly to distance himself from his fellow mafia member as suspicion grew, a common strategy used by mafia members to appear innocent.\n', '\n', "5. The overall aggressive approach by Mr. Michael Nelson Jr. in trying to direct votes and Nathan Lynch's strategic voting and comments suggest they were working together to manipulate the game's outcome, characteristic of mafia behavior in such social deduction games."]

Game 0696, Day 2:
 Actual Mafia: Mr. Michael Nelson Jr., Julian Barrett,  
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: Mr. Michael Nelson Jr., Nathan Lynch\n', 'Reason:\n', '1. **Mr. Michael Nelson Jr.** was very quick to accuse Julian Barrett without much discussion or reason, which is a common tactic used by mafia to deflect suspicion from themselves. His reasoning that Julian\'s name "sounds like a mobish name" is not substantial and seems like an attempt to manipulate the vote.\n', '2. **Nathan Lynch** was also quick to jump on the bandwagon to vote against Julian initially but then shifted his vote to Mr. Michael Nelson Jr. after others started suspecting Michael. This could be seen as an attempt to distance himself from his fellow mafia member once it became clear that Michael might be voted out.\n', '3. After Mr. Michael Nelson Jr. was voted out and another night passed, Nathan Lynch began acting erratically, suggesting even that others should vote for him. This behavior could be a strategy to appear as a non-threatening, confused player, which might reduce suspicion on him.\n', "4. Nathan Lynch's sudden shift in behavior and his initial participation in directing votes align with typical mafia strategies to control the flow of the game and protect themselves when under suspicion."]

Game 0696, Day 3:
 Actual Mafia: Mr. Michael Nelson Jr., Julian Barrett,  
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: Mr. Michael Nelson Jr., Brittany Taylor\n', 'Reason:\n', '1. **Mr. Michael Nelson Jr.** was very quick to accuse Julian Barrett without much discussion or reasoning, which is a common tactic used by mafia to deflect suspicion from themselves. His reasoning that Julian\'s name "sounds like a mobish name" is not substantial and seems like an attempt to create a reason where there isn\'t one.\n', '\n', '2. **Brittany Taylor** did not vote for Mr. Michael Nelson Jr. when he was under suspicion and eventually lynched. This could indicate a mafia trying to avoid voting out one of their own. Her voting behavior and the lack of strong participation in discussions could be seen as trying to remain under the radar.\n', '\n', '3. The nighttime killings also provide some insight. After Mr. Michael Nelson Jr. was voted out, Christopher Turner was killed during the night. If Mr. Michael Nelson Jr. was mafia, his fellow mafia member would likely target players who were active in voting him out or who could be a threat due to their analytical contributions in the game discussions.\n', '\n', "4. Brittany Taylor's behavior during the voting against her was also telling; she voted for Nicole Lang, who was actively participating and pushing against Mr. Michael Nelson Jr. earlier. This could be seen as an attempt to remove those who are likely to figure out the mafia's identity.\n", '\n', "5. The dialogue and voting patterns suggest that both Mr. Michael Nelson Jr. and Brittany Taylor were working to manipulate the game's outcome subtly, typical of mafia behavior in such social deduction games."]

Game 0697, Day 1:
 Actual Mafia: Harold Price, Benjamin Pollard,  
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: Benjamin Pollard, Rebecca Nguyen\n', 'Reason:\n', '1. **Early Voting**: Benjamin Pollard was the first to vote for John Luna, which can be a tactic used by mafia to direct suspicion towards a non-mafia player early in the game.\n', '2. **Consistent Targeting**: Rebecca Nguyen consistently targeted John Luna throughout the dialogue, even when there was no substantial evidence presented against him. This can be indicative of a mafia trying to eliminate a bystander.\n', '3. **Defensive Behavior**: Benjamin Pollard\'s behavior when questioned about his vote ("i just loaded in and had a vote already somehow?") seems defensive and confused, which might be an attempt to deflect suspicion.\n', '4. **Accusation by Wendy Leach**: Wendy Leach accused the three who picked John Luna (including Benjamin and Rebecca) of possibly being mafia and working together. This suspicion from another player adds weight to the theory that they might be coordinating as mafia.\n', '5. **Lack of Solid Defense**: Neither Benjamin nor Rebecca provided a solid defense or reasoning for their focus on John Luna, which is often a strategy used by mafia to avoid drawing attention to their lack of valid reasoning.\n', '6. **Dismissal of Other Suspicions**: Both players ignored other suspicions and conversations happening around, focusing solely on John Luna, which could indicate a mafia-driven agenda to ensure his elimination.']

Game 0697, Day 2:
 Actual Mafia: Harold Price, Benjamin Pollard,  
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: Rebecca Nguyen, Harold Price\n', 'Reason:\n', "1. **Harold Price's Early Accusation**: Harold Price was very quick to accuse John Luna right at the beginning of the day without any substantial evidence or discussion from others. This kind of behavior can be indicative of a mafia member trying to direct the group's attention towards an innocent bystander.\n", '\n', "2. **Rebecca Nguyen's Voting Pattern**: Rebecca was quick to vote for John Luna and later for Benjamin Pollard. Her quick decisions to vote without much discussion or reasoning can be a tactic used by mafia members to eliminate threats or suspicions towards themselves.\n", '\n', '3. **Group Dynamics and Accusations**: Wendy Leach accused the three people who voted for John Luna (including Rebecca and Harold) of possibly being mafia and working together. This kind of accusation from a bystander, who was later killed in the night, adds suspicion towards Rebecca and Harold.\n', '\n', '4. **Behavior During Voting**: Both Rebecca and Harold showed a pattern of being decisive and somewhat aggressive in their voting, which can be a strategy used by mafia members to ensure their targets are lynched.\n', '\n', '5. **Nighttime Killings Align with Their Safety**: The nighttime killings of Micheal Francis and Wendy Leach, who were possibly threats to the mafia, align with the interests of keeping mafia members like Rebecca and Harold safe and unchallenged.\n', '\n', '6. **Lack of Solid Defense or Diversions**: Neither Rebecca nor Harold provided solid defenses or attempted to divert suspicion in a constructive way; instead, they focused on pushing the group towards their targets. This can be indicative of mafia trying to control the narrative.\n', '\n', 'These observations suggest that Rebecca Nguyen and Harold Price were likely working together as mafia, influencing votes and directing suspicions to secure their positions and eliminate threats.']

Game 0698, Day 1:
 Actual Mafia: Brittany Evans, Erin Blevins,  
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: Elizabeth Andrews, Jamie Burch\n', 'Reason:\n', '1. Elizabeth Andrews was the first to vote, and she voted for Melissa Hunt, who was not a popular choice among other players. This could indicate an attempt to divert suspicion away from a fellow mafia member or to create confusion.\n', '2. Jamie Burch voted for Frank Steele, but significantly later than when the majority started voting for Frank. This delay in voting could be a strategic move to see where the majority vote was leaning before committing, a common tactic used by mafia to blend in.\n', '3. The majority of the players (Rachel Costa, Jorge Mcintosh, Lindsay Johnson, Erin Blevins, and Melissa Hunt) converged on voting for Frank Steele, suggesting a consensus among possibly innocent bystanders.\n', "4. The fact that Elizabeth Andrews' initial vote did not align with the majority and Jamie Burch's delayed vote could indicate mafia behavior, trying to manipulate the voting process without drawing attention to themselves."]

Game 0698, Day 2:
 Actual Mafia: Brittany Evans, Erin Blevins,  
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: Jamie Burch, Rachel Costa\n', 'Reason:\n', '1. **Observation of Voting Patterns**: Jamie Burch and Rachel Costa both voted for Frank Steele and Erin Blevins, who were subsequently lynched. Their consistent voting against these individuals, who turned out not to be mafia, suggests they were trying to eliminate bystanders.\n', '\n', '2. **Timing of Votes**: Jamie Burch was the first to vote for Erin Blevins, initiating the bandwagon. This is a common tactic used by mafia to direct suspicion away from themselves and onto a bystander.\n', '\n', '3. **Nighttime Kill Analysis**: After Frank Steele was voted out, Elizabeth Andrews was killed during the night. Given that Elizabeth was the first to vote against Melissa Hunt (a deviation from the majority who voted against Frank), her being targeted might indicate that she was on the right track but against a different mafia member, thus posing a threat. Mafia members, such as Jamie and Rachel, would benefit from removing someone who is actively participating and potentially close to discovering their identity.\n', '\n', "4. **General Game Dynamics**: The mafia would aim to remove active or insightful players who pose a threat to their anonymity and survival in the game. Both Jamie and Rachel's actions align with typical mafia behavior aimed at misdirecting and manipulating the voting process to ensure their survival and the elimination of bystanders.\n", '\n', '5. **Lack of Defense**: Neither Jamie Burch nor Rachel Costa made significant efforts to defend the individuals they voted against, nor did they provide strong reasoning for their choices, which can be indicative of mafia trying to avoid drawing attention to their motives.']

Game 0698, Day 3:
 Actual Mafia: Brittany Evans, Erin Blevins,  
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: Jamie Burch, Rachel Costa\n', 'Reason:\n', "1. **Initial Voting Patterns**: On the first day, Elizabeth Andrews voted for Melissa Hunt, but the majority voted for Frank Steele. This suggests that Elizabeth's vote was not aligned with the majority, which could indicate she was not mafia, as mafia often try to form a consensus to eliminate a bystander.\n", '\n', "2. **Nighttime Killings**: After Frank Steele was voted out, Elizabeth Andrews was killed during the night. Since mafia choose who to kill at night, and Elizabeth's voting pattern was different from the majority, it's likely she was a bystander targeted by the mafia.\n", '\n', '3. **Subsequent Daytime Voting**: On the next day, Jamie Burch quickly voted for Erin Blevins, followed by Rachel Costa, Melissa Hunt, Lindsay Johnson, Jorge Mcintosh, and Brittany Evans. Erin Blevins was then voted out. The quick consensus on Erin Blevins, especially from Jamie and Rachel, could indicate a mafia strategy to quickly eliminate another bystander.\n', '\n', "4. **Further Nighttime Killing**: After Erin Blevins was voted out, Jorge Mcintosh was killed during the night. Given that Jorge voted with the majority (which likely included mafia members), his death might have been to confuse the remaining players about the mafia's identity.\n", '\n', '5. **Final Voting and Accusations**: In the final rounds of voting, Jamie Burch and Rachel Costa both voted against Melissa Hunt, who was eventually voted out. Their consistent voting against the same individuals, who were then killed at night, suggests coordination typical of mafia behavior.\n', '\n', "6. **Behavior and Dialogue**: Jamie Burch's and Rachel Costa's interactions and voting patterns align closely throughout the game, suggesting a possible mafia collaboration. Their ability to sway votes and survive till the end without being suspected also points towards their roles as mafia."]

Game 0698, Day 4:
 Actual Mafia: Brittany Evans, Erin Blevins,  
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: Jamie Burch, Melissa Hunt\n', 'Reason:\n', '1. **Initial Voting Patterns**: On the first day, Elizabeth Andrews voted for Melissa Hunt, which is unusual as the majority voted for Frank Steele. This could indicate that Elizabeth suspected Melissa early on.\n', '\n', '2. **Nighttime Killings**: After Frank Steele was lynched, Elizabeth Andrews, who voted differently from the majority, was killed during the night. This could suggest that the mafia wanted to remove someone who might have been onto them.\n', '\n', '3. **Voting Dynamics**: During the vote where Erin Blevins was lynched, Jamie Burch initiated the vote against her. This could be a tactic used by the mafia to direct suspicion away from themselves.\n', '\n', '4. **Subsequent Actions**: After Erin Blevins was voted out, Jorge Mcintosh was killed in the night. Notably, Jorge had been active in voting against Frank Steele and Erin Blevins, both of whom were not mafia. This pattern suggests that the mafia were removing those who actively participated in lynching non-mafia members.\n', '\n', "5. **Final Stages**: In the final stages, Jamie Burch and Melissa Hunt were often voting together or supporting each other's choices. For instance, both voted for Melissa Hunt when it was down to a few players, which could be seen as an attempt to appear less suspicious by not consistently aligning their votes.\n", '\n', '6. **Endgame**: The final votes where Jamie Burch was voted out after the majority of the players had been eliminated or killed further supports the suspicion. The remaining players, including Rachel Costa and Brittany Evans, voted against Jamie, indicating a realization of his mafia role.\n', '\n', '7. **Behavioral Analysis**: Throughout the game, both Jamie Burch and Melissa Hunt displayed patterns of voting and behavior that aligned with typical mafia strategies: directing votes, removing strategic threats, and trying to blend in with majority decisions when under scrutiny.']

Game 0699, Day 1:
 Actual Mafia: Shawn Bailey, Tricia Miller,  
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: Jordan May, Donna Cook\n', 'Reason:\n', "1. **Jordan May's Early Accusation**: Jordan May was the first to vote against Diane Mooney, which can be a tactic used by mafia to direct suspicion away from themselves and onto a bystander. Diane Mooney later explicitly accuses Jordan May of being mafia, which could be seen as a dying declaration of a bystander.\n", '\n', '2. **Donna Cook\'s Aggressive Comment**: Donna Cook made a very direct and aggressive comment towards Diane Mooney ("Diane, it\'s about time you die"), which is unusual for a bystander who would typically be more cautious about accusations unless sure. This aggressive behavior can be indicative of trying to ensure the elimination of a bystander.\n', '\n', "3. **Voting Pattern and Behavior**: The majority of the players voted for Diane Mooney, which could indicate a bandwagon effect often initiated or pushed by mafia members. Donna Cook's vote and comment align with this pattern, suggesting a possible mafia role in steering the group's decision.\n", '\n', '4. **Diane Mooney\'s Reaction**: Diane Mooney\'s reaction to being voted out ("you guys just killed a bystander") and her direct accusation towards Jordan May suggest that she was indeed a bystander, making Jordan\'s initial vote and subsequent silence during the accusation more suspicious.\n', '\n', '5. **Lack of Defense**: Neither Jordan May nor Donna Cook provided a strong defense or rationale for their votes against Diane, which is often a strategy used by mafia to avoid drawing attention to themselves. Their relative silence, especially after an accusation, can be a tactic to remain under the radar.\n', '\n', 'These observations lead to the conclusion that Jordan May and Donna Cook are likely the mafia members in this scenario.']

Game 0699, Day 2:
 Actual Mafia: Shawn Bailey, Tricia Miller,  
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: Donna Cook, Chad Collins\n', 'Reason:\n', '1. **Donna Cook\'s Aggressive Behavior**: Donna Cook\'s dialogue throughout the game is notably aggressive and manipulative. She was quick to support the lynching of Diane Mooney, even making a harsh comment ("Diane, it\'s about time you die") right before Diane was voted out. This kind of behavior is often indicative of mafia trying to push the vote towards a certain player.\n', '\n', "2. **Chad Collins' Voting Pattern**: Chad Collins voted for Alicia Randall when the majority was clearly forming against Diane Mooney. This could be an attempt to divert attention from Diane if she were a fellow mafia, or simply to appear less aligned with the majority. On the following day, he voted for Donna Cook, which might seem like distancing from her if suspicions arose, but it's also a common mafia tactic to switch targets to confuse the bystanders.\n", '\n', "3. **Reaction to Diane Mooney's Accusation**: After Diane Mooney was voted out and revealed herself as a bystander, she accused Jordan May of being mafia. However, Jordan May was killed the next night, which is a typical mafia move to eliminate someone who might be wrongly perceived as mafia, thus reducing the number of bystanders further without drawing suspicion to the actual mafia.\n", '\n', "4. **Donna Cook's Defense and Accusations**: Donna Cook's repeated defenses about being a bystander and her attempts to shift suspicion towards others (like Alicia Randall) are typical of mafia behavior when under pressure. Her statements often tried to redirect the group's consensus or sow doubt about others' roles.\n", '\n', '5. **Lack of Solid Alibis**: Neither Donna Cook nor Chad Collins provided convincing alibis or contributions to finding the mafia, instead focusing on defending themselves or accusing others without substantial evidence.\n', '\n', '6. **Voting Outcomes and Night Actions**: The nighttime actions also align with the suspicions on Donna and Chad. After key players who were potential threats or wrongly accused (like Jordan May) were eliminated during the night, it suggests that the mafia were steering the daytime discussions to facilitate these outcomes.']

Game 0699, Day 3:
 Actual Mafia: Shawn Bailey, Tricia Miller,  
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: Chad Collins, Tricia Miller\n', 'Reason:\n', "1. **Voting Patterns and Accusations**: Throughout the game, Tricia Miller and Chad Collins exhibited suspicious voting behavior. For instance, Chad voted for Alicia Randall when the majority were voting for Diane Mooney, which could be seen as an attempt to divert attention from a fellow mafia member. Similarly, Tricia's votes often aligned with trying to remove suspicion from herself and possibly protect her mafia partner.\n", '\n', '2. **Reaction to Accusations**: Tricia Miller\'s reaction at the end, "And I would\'ve gotten away with it if it wasn\'t for you meddling kids :D," is a playful admission of her role as mafia after being cornered by the votes.\n', '\n', '3. **Nighttime Killings**: The nighttime killings also provide some insight. After Diane Mooney accused Jordan May of being mafia, Jordan was killed the next night. This could be interpreted as the mafia trying to remove suspicion by killing someone who was falsely accused, thus confusing the bystanders.\n', '\n', "4. **Behavior and Statements**: Chad's voting against Alicia when suspicion was not strongly on her, and his later vote for her again when the majority was voting for Tricia, suggests an attempt to mislead the group or protect his mafia partner by creating confusion.\n", '\n', '5. **Final Voting**: On the last day, Chad voted for Alicia Randall instead of Tricia Miller, despite the growing consensus and evidence against Tricia. This action aligns with mafia behavior trying to protect their remaining member by sowing discord.\n', '\n', 'These points collectively suggest that Chad Collins and Tricia Miller were working together as mafia, with their actions throughout the game aimed at misdirecting and manipulating the other players to avoid detection.']

 Actual Mafia: Sara Bright, Kevin Hodge,  
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: Robert Evans, Scott Nelson\n', 'Reason:\n', '1. Robert Evans was the first to vote, and he voted for Joshua Holland without any prior discussion or reasoning provided in the dialogue. This early, unsupported vote can be a tactic used by mafia to shift suspicion onto innocent bystanders.\n', '2. Scott Nelson received votes from Terri Brewer and Kevin Hodge, but neither of them provided any reasoning in the dialogue. This could indicate a coordinated effort to divert attention from Scott, possibly by fellow mafia members.\n', '3. The voting pattern shows that Robert Evans was eventually voted out, suggesting that the community might have suspected him due to his early and unsupported vote. His elimination and the subsequent nighttime phase imply that he was likely mafia, as the game did not end, indicating at least one mafia member was still active.\n', '4. Scott Nelson, having received votes but not enough to be eliminated, and without any defensive or explanatory dialogue, remains a suspect. The lack of dialogue from him also adds to the suspicion, as mafia members often try to remain inconspicuous.\n', '5. The other players who voted did not show a clear pattern of suspicious behavior, and the dialogue provided does not give further clues pointing to anyone else specifically being mafia.']

Game 0700, Day 2:
 Actual Mafia: Sara Bright, Kevin Hodge,  
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: Timothy Cherry, Scott Nelson\n', 'Reason:\n', "1. **Voting Patterns and Accusations**: Timothy Cherry's voting behavior is suspicious. He voted for Terri Brewer, who was later killed during the night, suggesting he might have been trying to cast suspicion elsewhere or remove a vocal player. His vote against Sara Bright after Terri's death could be seen as an attempt to mislead the group or eliminate another non-mafia player.\n", '\n', "2. **Survival and Lack of Accusation**: Scott Nelson received votes but survived multiple rounds of voting, which could indicate that he is being protected or that the focus is being shifted away from him. Notably, Sara Bright voted for him in the last round, which might suggest she suspected him but didn't have enough support.\n", '\n', '3. **Behavior and Interaction**: The dialogue provided doesn\'t show much interaction or defense from Scott Nelson, which might be a strategy to stay under the radar. Timothy Cherry\'s comment "wow what a game" could be interpreted as him enjoying the manipulation of the game, a behavior sometimes seen in mafia players.\n', '\n', "4. **Outcome of Votes**: The players Timothy Cherry voted against (Terri Brewer and Sara Bright) and the way votes were distributed suggests a pattern of trying to eliminate threats or direct suspicion towards others. Scott Nelson's survival, despite receiving votes, also aligns with a typical mafia strategy of protecting fellow mafia members while appearing to participate in the voting process.\n", '\n', "5. **Nighttime Kills**: The nighttime kills of Carlos Smith and Terri Brewer, followed by the voting out of non-threatening players, align with a strategy to weaken the group's ability to deduce the mafia's identity, which both Timothy and Scott could benefit from if they were mafia."]

Game 0700, Day 3:
 Actual Mafia: Sara Bright, Kevin Hodge,  
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: Kevin Hodge, Sara Bright\n', 'Reason:\n', '1. **Voting Patterns and Night Kills**: Observing the voting patterns and the sequence of night kills provides insights into potential mafia behavior. Mafia members often try to misdirect suspicion or eliminate those who suspect them.\n', '\n', "2. **Kevin Hodge's Voting**:\n", "   - Kevin voted for Scott Nelson twice (once leading to Scott's elimination), and once for Sandra Robinson. His votes seem to align with trying to remove players who were not attracting a majority of votes, potentially to mislead the group.\n", '\n', "3. **Sara Bright's Voting and Behavior**:\n", '   - Sara voted for Timothy Cherry, then for Scott Nelson, and finally for Sandra Robinson. Her voting pattern seems erratic and not aligned with the majority until the final stages, which could be a tactic to confuse the bystanders.\n', '   - Sara\'s comments ("oh no!" and "lolz") after Terri Brewer\'s death could be seen as an attempt to appear innocent or less threatening.\n', '\n', '4. **Night Kills Analysis**:\n', '   - After Robert Evans was voted out (who was voted by Sandra Robinson and Christian Atkinson), Terri Brewer was killed the following night. This could indicate that the mafia wanted to remove those who voted against their fellow mafia member.\n', '   - The killing of Timothy Cherry after Sandra Robinson was voted out (where Kevin Hodge voted against her) suggests that the mafia might be cleaning up those who could potentially be threats or are not aligning with their strategy.\n', '\n', '5. **Final Stages**:\n', "   - In the final stages, both Kevin and Sara voted for Scott Nelson, leading to his elimination. This could be a strategic move to ensure the mafia's numbers advantage.\n", '\n', "Given these observations, Kevin Hodge and Sara Bright's actions and voting patterns are consistent with trying to manipulate the game's outcome, aligning with typical mafia behavior in such social deduction games."]

Game 0701, Day 1:
 Actual Mafia: Brandy Knight, Ronald Smith,  
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: Cody Henderson Jr., Elizabeth Mason\n', 'Reason:\n', '1. **Cody Henderson Jr.** was very active in directing the conversation and pushing for votes against Kelly Lopez. His early comment about the mafia missing their chance could be a tactic to divert suspicion from himself.\n', "2. **Elizabeth Mason** quickly followed Cody's lead in voting for Kelly Lopez without much discussion or reasoning, which could indicate a coordinated effort.\n", "3. Both Cody and Elizabeth focused the group's attention on Kelly, who was ultimately voted out, without providing substantial evidence or reasoning for why she might be mafia, which is a common strategy used by mafia members to eliminate bystanders.\n", '4. The other players, such as Brandy Knight and Adam Davidson, did not show signs of coordination or leading the conversation in a way that would suggest they were working together as mafia. Brandy even expressed reluctance in choosing someone to vote out, which is less typical of mafia behavior.\n', "5. The quick agreement and voting pattern between Cody and Elizabeth suggest they could be working together to steer the votes, which is characteristic of mafia members trying to control the game's outcome."]

Game 0701, Day 2:
 Actual Mafia: Brandy Knight, Ronald Smith,  
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: Elizabeth Mason, Brandy Knight\n', 'Reason:\n', '1. **Nighttime Activity**: The first night ended with no one being killed. This could indicate a disagreement or confusion among the mafia members about whom to target.\n', '\n', '2. **Voting Patterns and Accusations**:\n', '   - **Elizabeth Mason** was quick to suggest targeting Kelly Lopez without much discussion or evidence, which could be a tactic to direct suspicion away from herself.\n', '   - **Brandy Knight** initially voted for Kelly Lopez and later claimed to hate picking someone to get rid of, which might be an attempt to appear reluctant and less aggressive, a common strategy for mafia trying to blend in.\n', '\n', '3. **Behavior and Comments**:\n', '   - **Cody Henderson Jr.** was very active in discussions and was subsequently killed during the night after Kelly Lopez was voted out. Mafia might target active players who are likely to influence the game against them.\n', '   - **Elizabeth Mason** and **Brandy Knight** both showed a pattern of agreeing on votes without contributing much to the discussion, which can be a tactic used by mafia members to avoid drawing attention to themselves.\n', '\n', '4. **Outcome of Votes**:\n', "   - The quick agreement on voting out Ronald Smith after Cody's death, led by Elizabeth and followed by Brandy, could indicate their attempt to quickly reduce the number of bystanders. Their voting was decisive and lacked substantial discussion, which might suggest a prior agreement or understanding typical of mafia behavior.\n", '\n', '5. **General Observations**:\n', '   - The mafia members would benefit from removing those who either pose a threat by their deductions or are likely to rally others. The elimination of Cody, followed by the quick decision to vote out Ronald, aligns with a strategy to remove those who could influence group decisions against the mafia.\n', "   - Elizabeth and Brandy's roles in these decisions were pivotal yet subtly executed, aligning with common mafia tactics to control the game flow without being overtly aggressive or suspicious."]

Game 0701, Day 3:
 Actual Mafia: Brandy Knight, Ronald Smith,  
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: Elizabeth Mason, Brandy Knight\n', 'Reason:\n', '1. **Night 1 - No Kill:** The first night ended with no one being killed. This could indicate a disagreement or confusion among the mafia members.\n', '\n', '2. **Day 1 - Kelly Lopez Lynching:** Brandy Knight initiated the vote against Kelly Lopez, followed by Elizabeth Mason and Cody Henderson Jr. Cody, who was later killed by the mafia, seemed to be genuinely confused and following the crowd, which might indicate he was not mafia.\n', '\n', "3. **Night 2 - Cody Henderson Jr. Killed:** The mafia killed Cody Henderson Jr. the next night, which suggests that Cody was not mafia, as mafia members do not kill their own. This killing could be seen as a strategic move to remove someone who might influence the group's decisions.\n", '\n', "4. **Day 2 - Ronald Smith Lynching:** After Cody's death, the next day saw Ronald Smith being voted out, primarily driven by votes from Elizabeth Mason and Brandy Knight. Adam Davidson, who was later voted out, also participated, but his behavior seemed more reactive than leading.\n", '\n', '5. **Night 3 - William Williams Killed:** The killing of William Williams further reduced the number of bystanders. Notably, Elizabeth and Brandy were still active and voting together in subsequent rounds.\n', '\n', "6. **Day 3 - Adam Davidson Lynching:** On the third day, Elizabeth Mason and Brandy Knight both voted for Adam Davidson, who was then voted out. Adam's vote against Brandy could indicate his suspicion towards her, but it was too late.\n", '\n', '7. **Pattern of Voting and Survival:** Throughout the game, Elizabeth Mason and Brandy Knight consistently voted together and influenced the lynching decisions. Their survival till the later stages of the game, combined with their voting patterns and the nighttime killings focusing on those outside their voting bloc, strongly suggests they were collaborating as mafia.']

Game 0702, Day 1:
 Actual Mafia: Paul Gaines, Danielle Oliver,  
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: Ashley Stout, Jill Mcdonald\n', 'Reason:\n', '1. **Ashley Stout\'s aggressive accusation**: Right at the beginning of the day, Ashley Stout immediately accuses Cory Barron without any substantial evidence or reasoning, simply stating "Cory Baron. Everyone vote Cory Baron" and later adding "Barron is a mafia name" repeatedly. This kind of baseless and persistent accusation is often a tactic used by mafia members to divert attention from themselves and eliminate a bystander.\n', '\n', '2. **Jill Mcdonald\'s behavior and statements**: Jill Mcdonald initially suggests eliminating Danielle Oliver but quickly switches to support Ashley\'s campaign against Cory Barron. This quick flip in opinion without a clear rationale might indicate mafia behavior, trying to rally votes against a non-mafia player. Additionally, Jill\'s statement, "Yes eliminate me so I can get paid and get away from you losers," could be interpreted as a slip indicating her mafia role, where being eliminated might still result in a mafia win, thus "getting paid."\n', '\n', '3. **Lack of defense against each other**: Throughout the dialogue, neither Ashley nor Jill attempt to defend each other or detract attention from each other, which can be a subtle tactic used by mafia members to avoid drawing connections between themselves.\n', '\n', '4. **Reaction to votes and accusations**: Ashley and Jill both focus their efforts on Cory, a common mafia strategy to concentrate votes on one individual to ensure a non-mafia member is eliminated. Their lack of engagement with other accusations (like those against Abigail Woods by Laura Buck) also points to a possible coordinated effort.\n', '\n', "5. **General suspicion and gameplay**: The aggressive and somewhat random nature of accusations by Ashley, followed by Jill's quick agreement and later nonchalant attitude towards being targeted, aligns with typical mafia behavior trying to manipulate the game's flow without drawing genuine suspicion onto themselves."]

Game 0702, Day 2:
 Actual Mafia: Paul Gaines, Danielle Oliver,  
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: Jill Mcdonald, Danielle Oliver\n', 'Reason:\n', '1. **Jill Mcdonald\'s Behavior**: Jill\'s statement, "Yes eliminate me so I can get paid and get away from you losers," suggests a nonchalant attitude towards being targeted, which could be a tactic to reverse psychology the other players into not voting her out, a common mafia strategy.\n', '\n', '2. **Danielle Oliver\'s Focus on Jill**: Danielle\'s focus shifts to Jill right after Cory is voted out, suggesting she might be trying to redirect suspicion onto another player. Her statement, "Jill Mcdonald AFTER CORY," followed by Jill being killed the next night, raises suspicion. It seems like a strategic move to eliminate another player who might be drawing too much attention.\n', '\n', "3. **Ashley Stout's Accusations and Outcome**: Ashley Stout was very vocal and accusatory, which led to her being voted out. Typically, mafia members benefit from directing attention onto vocal bystanders to keep suspicion off themselves. The fact that Ashley was voted out following her accusations against Danielle further supports the idea that Danielle might be manipulating the group's focus to protect herself and possibly another mafia member.\n", '\n', "4. **Nighttime Killings Align with Danielle's Statements**: The sequence of nighttime killings aligns suspiciously with Danielle's daytime accusations and statements. After targeting Cory and then shifting focus to Jill, both of whom were subsequently killed, it suggests a pattern where Danielle's daytime targets align with nighttime mafia activity.\n", '\n', '5. **Lack of Defense or Counter-Strategy**: Both Jill and Danielle do not strongly defend themselves or offer substantial counter-arguments, which is often seen in mafia gameplay where players maintain a low profile or subtly manipulate the conversation without drawing direct attention to themselves.\n', '\n', 'Based on these observations, Jill Mcdonald and Danielle Oliver are likely the mafia members in this game.']

Game 0702, Day 3:
 Actual Mafia: Paul Gaines, Danielle Oliver,  
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: Danielle Oliver, Ashley Stout\n', 'Reason:\n', "1. **Ashley Stout's Aggressive Accusations**: Ashley Stout was very quick to accuse Cory Barron without substantial evidence, repeatedly insisting on his guilt based on his name alone. This kind of behavior can be indicative of a mafia member trying to divert attention from themselves by casting suspicion on others.\n", '\n', "2. **Danielle Oliver's Shift in Focus**: Danielle Oliver initially supported the vote against Cory Barron but quickly shifted her focus to Jill Mcdonald right after Cory was voted out. This sudden shift could be a strategy to remove any players who might suspect her, aligning with typical mafia behavior to control the flow of the game.\n", '\n', "3. **Nighttime Killings Post-Voting**: After Cory Barron was voted out, Jill Mcdonald, who was becoming suspicious and vocal, was killed during the night. This aligns with mafia tactics where players who pose a threat or are close to discovering the mafia's identity are eliminated.\n", '\n', "4. **Ashley Stout and Danielle Oliver's Mutual Defense**: During the subsequent daytime discussions, both Ashley and Danielle were quick to accuse each other when suspicion began to fall on them. This could be seen as a tactic to appear as if they are not aligned, thus reducing suspicion on themselves as being mafia together.\n", '\n', '5. **Outcome of Votes and Accusations**: The pattern of accusations and the outcomes of nighttime killings suggest that both Ashley and Danielle were trying to manipulate the votes and discussions to their advantage, a common strategy employed by the mafia to ensure their survival and the elimination of bystanders.\n', '\n', '6. **Final Days and Accusations**: Towards the end of the observed dialogues, both Ashley and Danielle were heavily involved in directing accusations, which is consistent with mafia members attempting to control the narrative and outcome of the game as the number of players dwindles.\n', '\n', "These observations suggest that Ashley Stout and Danielle Oliver were likely working together as mafia, using aggressive accusations, strategic shifts in focus, and manipulation of group dynamics to influence the game's outcome in their favor."]

Game 0702, Day 4:
 Actual Mafia: Paul Gaines, Danielle Oliver,  
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: Danielle Oliver, Ashley Stout\n', 'Reason:\n', '1. **Ashley Stout** was very aggressive from the beginning, pushing hard for Cory Barron\'s elimination without substantial evidence, only claiming "Barron is a mafia name." This kind of baseless accusation is often used by mafia members to divert attention from themselves.\n', '\n', '2. **Danielle Oliver** also showed suspicious behavior by quickly jumping on the bandwagon to vote out Cory Barron and later aggressively targeting Jill Mcdonald. After Cory was voted out, Jill was killed during the night, which might suggest that Danielle, as mafia, wanted to remove those she publicly argued against to reduce suspicion on herself.\n', '\n', '3. The pattern of killings aligns with the suspicions raised by Danielle and Ashley during the day. After targeting Cory and Jill, both were subsequently killed during the night, which could indicate that the mafia (Danielle and Ashley) were trying to eliminate those they had conflicts with during the day to clean up any loose ends.\n', '\n', "4. Ashley's elimination led to a decrease in aggressive accusations the following day, which might suggest her role as a mafia orchestrator in creating chaos and mistrust among the bystanders.\n", '\n', "5. Danielle continued to aggressively target other players (like Donna and Laura) after Ashley's elimination, which aligns with typical mafia behavior of trying to control the narrative and eliminate threats or those suspicious of her.\n", '\n', '6. The voting patterns and nighttime killings correlate with the accusations made by Danielle and Ashley, supporting the theory that they were working together to manipulate the daytime discussions and nighttime eliminations.']

Game 0703, Day 1:
 Actual Mafia: Melanie Salas, Bryan Brown,  
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: Carolyn Santana, Richard Adams MD\n', 'Reason:\n', '1. Carolyn Santana was the first to vote, targeting Melanie Salas without any substantial evidence or discussion, which is a common tactic used by mafia to shift suspicion onto others.\n', '2. Melanie Salas and Carolyn Santana exchanged votes, which could indicate a conflict between a bystander (Melanie) and a mafia (Carolyn), especially since Carolyn initiated the accusation.\n', "3. Richard Adams MD's behavior was suspicious because he voted for Melanie Salas after a brief and non-substantial exchange, aligning with Carolyn's vote. This could indicate a coordinated effort to eliminate a bystander.\n", '4. Caroline Moss voted for Richard Adams MD, which might suggest she sensed something off about his behavior or alignment, possibly identifying him as mafia.\n', '5. The dialogue between Carolyn and Melanie, where Carolyn quickly accuses Melanie of being a mobster without much provocation, further supports the idea that Carolyn was trying to deflect suspicion from herself.\n', '6. Richard Adams MD\'s casual comment, "Lol are we all bystanders?" could be an attempt to downplay his role and blend in with the actual bystanders, a strategy often used by mafia members to create confusion and blend in.']

Game 0703, Day 2:
 Actual Mafia: Melanie Salas, Bryan Brown,  
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: Carolyn Santana, Caroline Moss\n', 'Reason:\n', "1. **Initial Voting Patterns**: Carolyn Santana was the first to vote, targeting Melanie Salas early in the day without substantial discussion or reason. This could indicate an attempt to direct the group's suspicion towards someone else early on.\n", '\n', '2. **Defensive Behavior**: Melanie Salas and Carolyn Santana exchanged accusations, which is common in the game. However, Carolyn\'s insistence without much evidence and her quick jump to conclusions ("she\'s a mobster!") could be a tactic to deflect suspicion from herself.\n', '\n', '3. **Voting Outcome**: Melanie Salas was voted out, and the subsequent nighttime resulted in the death of Richard Adams MD, who had voted against Melanie. If Melanie were mafia, the mafia might not target someone who voted against their own. This suggests Melanie was likely a bystander, and those pushing for her exit (Carolyn, Terri Green, Richard Adams MD) might include mafia trying to remove a bystander.\n', '\n', "4. **Subsequent Daytime Behavior**: After Richard's death, Carolyn continues to play a significant role in directing votes, this time against Bryan Brown, again initiating the vote. Her pattern of being the first to vote and pushing decisions could be a mafia tactic to control the game's flow.\n", '\n', "5. **Caroline Moss's Actions**: Caroline Moss, while less overtly aggressive, follows Carolyn's voting pattern, supporting her in voting out both Melanie and Bryan. This could indicate a collaboration, typical of mafia members supporting each other to sway group decisions.\n", '\n', "6. **Lack of Solid Defense**: Both Carolyn and Caroline do not provide strong alibis or defenses when voting; they seem more focused on directing the group's decisions. Their behavior is more about influencing outcomes than participating in mutual suspicion and investigation, which is typical in bystander behavior.\n", '\n', "7. **Outcome of Votes**: The players Carolyn and Caroline pushed to vote out (Melanie and Bryan) were not confirmed as mafia, suggesting that their eliminations were misdirects benefiting the mafia's goal to outnumber the bystanders."]

Game 0704, Day 1:
 Actual Mafia: Jon Gutierrez, Ryan Russell,  
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: Ryan Russell, Stephanie Espinoza\n', 'Reason:\n', '1. **Ryan Russell\'s Behavior**: Ryan\'s initial question about how the game works ("How does this work") could be a tactic to appear naive and less threatening, a common strategy used by mafia players to deflect suspicion. His subsequent comments, such as claiming to be a "natural" at playing dumb and referencing IT ("We all float down here"), add a layer of nonchalance and detachment, which might be a tactic to avoid serious scrutiny.\n', '\n', '2. **Stephanie Espinoza\'s Voting and Comments**: Stephanie was quick to vote for Joshua Herman, aligning with Ryan\'s vote, which could indicate a coordinated effort. Her comments during the voting, like "We\'re all dumb here" and "Some are more dumb than others," could be seen as attempts to trivialize the discussion and reduce the focus on her actions. Her remark about wanting to be voted out to "complete this HIT faster" could be an attempt to reverse psychology, making it seem like she doesn’t care about being voted out because she\'s not mafia.\n', '\n', '3. **Voting Patterns and Accusations**: Joshua Herman accused Ryan of playing dumb, which led to a direct confrontation between them. Both Ryan and Stephanie, who is suspected of being his mafia partner, voted for Joshua, potentially to remove someone who was onto them. The fact that both of them targeted Joshua could indicate a mafia strategy to eliminate a threat.\n', '\n', '4. **Lack of Defense or Counteraccusation**: Neither Ryan nor Stephanie actively defended themselves or redirected accusations towards others, which is often a tactic used by mafia members to keep the focus away from themselves. Their strategy seemed more about blending in and agreeing with general sentiments rather than stirring the pot, which can be a tactic to avoid drawing attention.\n', '\n', "These observations suggest that Ryan Russell and Stephanie Espinoza were working together, using subtle manipulation and voting coordination to influence the game's outcome, typical behaviors observed in mafia players."]

Game 0704, Day 2:
 Actual Mafia: Jon Gutierrez, Ryan Russell,  
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: Ryan Russell, Paul Schneider\n', 'Reason:\n', '1. **Ryan Russell\'s Behavior**: Ryan\'s initial feigned ignorance about how the game works ("How does this work") could be a tactic to appear less threatening and divert suspicion. His later comments, such as "Kind of natural at this point" and references to "IT" and "99 Red Balloons," seem to be attempts to lighten the mood and distract from serious discussions about the mafia\'s identity.\n', '\n', "2. **Paul Schneider's Voting and Comments**: Paul voted for Stephanie Espinoza, who was eventually found to be a bystander. His engagement in light-hearted banter with Ryan, especially about topics unrelated to the game (e.g., red balloons), could be seen as a strategy to build camaraderie and deflect suspicion from themselves.\n", '\n', '3. **Interaction Between Ryan and Paul**: The interaction between Ryan and Paul, particularly their shared jokes and non-game related discussions, suggests a possible alliance. This is supported by their mutual participation in diverting the conversation from strategic game talk.\n', '\n', '4. **Voting Patterns and Outcomes**: Both Ryan and Paul voted against Joshua Herman and Stephanie Espinoza, who were both bystanders. Their consistent voting against non-mafia players without drawing suspicion on themselves indicates strategic mafia behavior.\n', '\n', '5. **Nighttime Kill Selections**: The selection of who was killed during the night (Dwayne Lam and Brent Green) and the subsequent daytime behavior of Ryan and Paul do not directly implicate them, which is often a strategy used by mafia members to keep the focus away from themselves.\n', '\n', '6. **General Game Dynamics**: The mafia would benefit from removing players who either are onto them or have the potential to influence others effectively. The removal of active and potentially insightful players like Joshua Herman and Stephanie Espinoza fits this pattern, aligning with the interests of Ryan and Paul if they were mafia.']

Game 0704, Day 3:
 Actual Mafia: Jon Gutierrez, Ryan Russell,  
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: Ryan Russell, Jon Gutierrez\n', 'Reason:\n', '1. **Ryan Russell\'s Behavior**: Ryan\'s initial feigned ignorance about the game ("How does this work") could be a tactic to appear less threatening. His later comments, such as "Kind of natural at this point" and references to "IT" and "99 Red Balloons," seem to be attempts to deflect serious discussion and keep the conversation light, potentially to avoid suspicion.\n', '\n', '2. **Voting Patterns**: Ryan voted for Joshua Herman, who was eventually lynched and turned out to be a bystander. This aligns with mafia behavior of trying to eliminate non-mafia players. His later interactions and lack of serious engagement in finding the mafia also point towards him trying to mislead the others.\n', '\n', '3. **Jon Gutierrez\'s Actions**: Jon voted for Joshua Herman, contributing to the elimination of a bystander. His casual demeanor the next morning ("Morning guys, lol") after a night where another bystander (Brent Green) was killed could be seen as insensitive or indicative of someone trying to downplay the severity of the situation, a common mafia tactic to reduce tension and suspicion on themselves.\n', '\n', '4. **Lack of Solid Alibis or Defense**: Neither Ryan nor Jon provided any solid reasoning or defense against the accusations or suspicions directed towards them. They also did not actively engage in trying to deduce who the mafia might be, instead focusing on less relevant conversation.\n', '\n', '5. **Final Voting for Stephanie Espinoza**: Both Ryan and Jon voted for Stephanie Espinoza, who was expressing suspicion and trying to analyze previous votes, which could indicate that she was getting close to discovering their identities. Mafia members often try to eliminate those who are most suspicious of them.\n', '\n', "Based on these observations, Ryan Russell and Jon Gutierrez's actions and behaviors align closely with typical mafia strategies of misdirection, elimination of threats, and maintaining a low profile with occasional strategic voting."]

Game 0705, Day 1:
 Actual Mafia: Michael Carter, Steven Davis,  
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: Daniel Parks, Dana Wilson\n', 'Reason:\n', '1. **Voting Pattern**: Daniel Parks and Dana Wilson both voted for Shannon Ryan early in the day. This could indicate a coordinated effort to eliminate a specific player, which is a common strategy used by the mafia to focus their votes and ensure the elimination of a bystander.\n', '   \n', "2. **Christina Walker's Vote**: Christina Walker, who was killed during the night, voted for Tamara Wilkinson. If Christina was a bystander, her vote against Tamara might have been a misdirection by the mafia to confuse the other players. However, her being targeted at night suggests she might have been onto something or was seen as a threat by the mafia.\n", '\n', "3. **Tamara Wilkinson's Defense**: Tamara Wilkinson directly warned Shannon Ryan that the mafia was targeting her. This kind of open accusation and defense are less likely from a mafia member, as they generally aim to be subtler to avoid drawing attention to themselves.\n", '\n', "4. **Shannon Ryan's Elimination**: The fact that Shannon was voted out after being heavily targeted by Daniel and Dana, and considering Tamara's warning, suggests that Shannon might have been a bystander. Mafia members often try to remove those who are either onto them or who are not aligning with their voting strategy.\n", '\n', "5. **Tamara's Vote Against Daniel**: Tamara's vote against Daniel Parks could indicate her suspicion towards him, possibly based on insights gathered during the game that were not explicitly stated in the dialogue. This action aligns with her defensive stance towards Shannon, suggesting she might have been trying to protect a fellow bystander and target a mafia member.\n", '\n', "Given these observations, Daniel Parks and Dana Wilson's actions align more closely with typical mafia behavior, focusing their votes and potentially manipulating the game's direction to their advantage."]

Game 0705, Day 2:
 Actual Mafia: Michael Carter, Steven Davis,  
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: Dana Wilson, Michael Carter\n', 'Reason:\n', '1. **Voting Patterns and Accusations**: Throughout the game, Dana Wilson and Michael Carter consistently voted together against the same targets. They voted for Shannon Ryan initially and then for Tamara Wilkinson after Shannon was eliminated. Consistent voting patterns can indicate mafia members working together to eliminate threats or bystanders.\n', '\n', "2. **Nighttime Kills**: After Shannon Ryan, who was heavily targeted by Dana and Michael, was voted out, Daniel Parks was killed during the night. Daniel had previously voted against Shannon, suggesting that his elimination might have been a strategic move by the mafia to remove someone who opposed their earlier target, aligning with Dana and Michael's interests.\n", '\n', "3. **Tamara Wilkinson's Accusations and Defense**: Tamara accused Shannon of being targeted by the mafia and later shifted her suspicion towards Daniel Parks, which diverted attention from Dana and Michael. Her defensive statements and eventual vote against Dana could indicate her realization of Dana's true role but it was too late.\n", '\n', '4. **Final Conversations**: The dialogues between Dana Wilson and Tamara Wilkinson in the final daytime session were playful yet slightly mocking, which could be interpreted as Dana being confident about her position and knowing that Tamara was not a threat, possibly because Dana knew the mafia had the upper hand.\n', '\n', '5. **Lack of Defense**: Neither Dana nor Michael made significant efforts to defend themselves or provide strong alibis during the accusations, which is often a strategy used by mafia members to avoid drawing attention to themselves.\n', '\n', "Based on these observations, Dana Wilson and Michael Carter's actions and interactions throughout the game strongly suggest that they were working together as the mafia."]

Game 0705, Day 3:
 Actual Mafia: Michael Carter, Steven Davis,  
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: Dana Wilson, Michael Carter\n', 'Reason:\n', '1. **Voting Patterns and Accusations**: Dana Wilson and Michael Carter consistently voted together against the same targets (Shannon Ryan, Tamara Wilkinson, Heather French) which could indicate a strategy to eliminate non-mafia players systematically.\n', '\n', "2. **Nighttime Kill Analysis**: After Shannon Ryan was voted out, Daniel Parks was killed during the night. Dana and Michael did not vote for Daniel, possibly indicating that they did not see him as a threat, or they wanted to remove suspicion from themselves by not targeting someone they hadn't previously voted against.\n", '\n', '3. **Behavior During Accusations**: Dana Wilson\'s dialogue often seems to deflect or lighten the mood when suspicion might be directed towards her or the mafia ("Things that make you go \'hmm\'", "Maybe it will be an open-ending like the Sopranos?"). This could be a tactic to reduce tension and suspicion.\n', '\n', '4. **Final Voting and Comments**: In the final rounds of voting, both Dana and Michael focus their votes on Tamara Wilkinson and Heather French, who are then sequentially voted out. Their consistent agreement in votes across different days supports the theory that they are collaborating.\n', '\n', "5. **Survival and Elimination of Threats**: Both Dana and Michael survive multiple rounds of voting without being significantly targeted themselves, which might indicate they are successfully manipulating the group's decisions to keep themselves safe while eliminating perceived threats or vocal players who might influence the group against them."]

Game 0705, Day 4:
 Actual Mafia: Michael Carter, Steven Davis,  
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: Dana Wilson, Michael Carter\n', 'Reason:\n', '1. **Voting Patterns and Accusations**: Dana Wilson and Michael Carter consistently voted together against the same individuals, which can be a sign of mafia members coordinating their votes to manipulate the outcomes. For instance, they both voted for Tamara Wilkinson and Heather French on the same days.\n', '\n', '2. **Nighttime Kills**: The nighttime kills often targeted individuals who were either isolated in votes during the day or posed a threat by their suspicions or voting against Dana or Michael. For example, after Daniel Parks, who was voted on by Tamara (not Dana or Michael), was killed during the night, it could indicate a move to remove those not aligning with their strategy.\n', '\n', "3. **Behavior and Dialogue**: Dana Wilson's dialogue often seemed to deflect or lighten the mood during critical moments of accusation or suspicion, which can be a tactic to reduce scrutiny on oneself. Michael Carter, while less vocal, followed similar voting patterns which align with Dana's, supporting the strategy subtly.\n", '\n', "4. **Survival and Influence**: Both Dana Wilson and Michael Carter survived multiple rounds of voting without being major targets, which could indicate they were successfully manipulating the group's perception to appear as non-threatening. Their ability to influence votes without drawing attention to themselves is characteristic of mafia gameplay.\n", '\n', "5. **Final Stages**: Towards the end of the provided transcript, Dana and Michael's continued survival, while other more vocal or suspected individuals were voted out or killed during the night, further points to their potential roles as mafia. They managed to avoid the spotlight while effectively guiding the group's decisions."]

Game 0706, Day 1:
 Actual Mafia: James Lamb, Eric Fisher,  
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: Eric Fisher, George Le\n', 'Reason:\n', '1. **Initial Voting Pattern**: The first two votes against Eric Fisher came from James Martin and George Le. This early alignment against a single player can sometimes indicate a strategy by mafia members to focus suspicion elsewhere.\n', '\n', '2. **James Martin\'s Behavior and Outcome**: James Martin, who was one of the first to vote for Eric Fisher, was voted out. His behavior (repeatedly saying "HI" and "HELLO" with little substantial contribution to discussions) could have been perceived as suspicious or annoying, leading to his lynching. However, his early vote against Eric Fisher, followed by his own lynching, suggests he might not have been mafia, as mafia members typically try to avoid drawing attention to their fellow mafia.\n', '\n', '3. **Consistent Voting Against Eric Fisher**: Despite the shift in focus towards James Martin, Eric Fisher received consistent votes from George Le and Daniel Jones. This could indicate a bystander trying to defend themselves or mafia trying to mislead.\n', '\n', "4. **George Le's Role**: George Le was one of the first to vote against Eric Fisher and did not change his vote. His consistency in voting against Eric Fisher, who was also suspected by others, might be a tactic to appear as a concerned bystander.\n", '\n', '5. **Lack of Defense or Accusation from Eric Fisher**: Eric Fisher, despite being a target, did not actively defend himself or make substantial accusations against others, which is sometimes a strategy used by mafia members to remain under the radar.\n', '\n', "6. **Dalton Frazier's Independent Vote**: Dalton Frazier voted for James Lamb, which deviates from the majority. This could either be a strategic move as a mafia to appear independent or a genuine bystander move. Given the lack of other evidence pointing to him, it's less likely he's mafia.\n", '\n', "Based on the voting dynamics and behaviors, Eric Fisher and George Le's actions fit a pattern where they could be working together to shift focus and control the flow of accusations, typical of mafia behavior in such games."]

Game 0706, Day 2:
 Actual Mafia: James Lamb, Eric Fisher,  
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: James Martin, George Le\n', 'Reason:\n', "1. **James Martin's Early Vote**: James Martin was the first to vote and he voted for Eric Fisher right at the beginning of the day without any discussion or reason provided. This early, unprovoked vote can be a tactic used by mafia to direct suspicion away from themselves and onto an innocent bystander.\n", '\n', "2. **George Le's Consistent Voting**: George Le consistently voted for Eric Fisher across multiple rounds without changing his vote or providing substantial reasoning, even when the conversation among other players evolved. This could indicate an attempt to persistently eliminate a specific player, which is a common mafia strategy to remove suspicion from themselves.\n", '\n', "3. **Reaction to Accusations and Voting Patterns**: After Rachael Cunningham suggested that people voting the same might be mafia, there was a shift in voting patterns. James Martin, who was previously voted out, had voted for Eric Fisher along with George Le, aligning with Rachael's suspicion. This shift after Rachael's comment could indicate that other players started suspecting George Le based on consistent voting patterns aligned with another suspected mafia (James Martin).\n", '\n', "4. **Nighttime Kill Selection**: After James Martin was voted out, Rachael Cunningham, who had been active in discussing mafia behavior and voting patterns, was killed during the night. This suggests that the remaining mafia wanted to silence a player who was actively contributing to uncovering their identity, further implicating George Le, who continued his previous voting behavior even after Rachael's death.\n", '\n', '5. **Lack of Defense and Continuation of Pattern**: Throughout the dialogues, George Le did not effectively defend his repeated votes against Eric Fisher nor did he provide a convincing rationale, which is often seen in mafia gameplay to avoid drawing attention while sticking to a simple strategy of eliminating the same player repeatedly.']

Game 0706, Day 3:
 Actual Mafia: James Lamb, Eric Fisher,  
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: James Lamb, Eric Fisher\n', 'Reason:\n', "1. **James Lamb's Voting Pattern**: James Lamb's voting behavior is inconsistent and seems strategic. He voted for James Martin initially, then switched to Lori Solomon, and later voted for Maxwell Reyes. This pattern suggests he might be trying to manipulate the voting to remove suspicion from himself and target non-mafia members.\n", '\n', '2. **Eric Fisher\'s Behavior**: Eric Fisher\'s comments and voting are also suspicious. He voted for James Martin initially, then switched to George Le, and later continued to vote for George Le even after Rachael Cunningham suggested that people voting the same might be mafia. His comment "I guess Rachel was right 😂" after Rachael was killed in the night could be seen as a taunt, which is typical behavior for mafia trying to confuse the bystanders.\n', '\n', '3. **Nighttime Kills and Daytime Votes**: The nighttime kills often targeted players who were either actively participating in discussions or had suspicions about others, which is a common mafia tactic to remove those who might influence the game against them. For example, Rachael Cunningham was killed after she started suspecting a pattern in the voting.\n', '\n', '4. **General Observations**: Both James Lamb and Eric Fisher were not heavily suspected by others, allowing them to navigate through the votes without drawing much attention to themselves. Their ability to remain under the radar while influencing votes is characteristic of experienced mafia players.\n', '\n', "5. **Final Voting Rounds**: In the later rounds, both James Lamb and Eric Fisher's voting patterns show attempts to eliminate threats or sway suspicion towards others, which aligns with typical mafia behavior trying to secure their numbers advantage as the game progresses."]

Game 0707, Day 1:
 Actual Mafia: Alyssa Washington, Mary Mullins,  
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: John Davis, Robert Stewart MD\n', 'Reason:\n', '1. **John Davis** was the first to suggest a name (Patrick Ellis) for lynching without any substantial evidence or discussion. This can be a tactic used by mafia members to divert attention from themselves and put it on an innocent bystander.\n', "2. **Robert Stewart MD** immediately agreed with John Davis's suggestion to vote for Patrick Ellis, showing a possible alignment or quick agreement typical of mafia members supporting each other's suggestions to strengthen their position.\n", '3. The voting pattern also supports this suspicion. Both John Davis and Robert Stewart MD voted for Patrick Ellis quickly after the suggestion was made, which could indicate a coordinated effort to ensure a specific person was voted out.\n', '4. Brandy Waller, who voted against John Davis, pointed out that he was quick to make a suggestion, which could be seen as suspicious behavior typically associated with trying to control the narrative and outcome of the game, a common strategy for mafia members.\n', '5. The lack of substantial defense or alternative suggestions from John Davis and Robert Stewart MD also adds to the suspicion, as they did not engage much in discussion or provide reasons for their choice beyond agreeing with each other.']

Game 0707, Day 2:
 Actual Mafia: Alyssa Washington, Mary Mullins,  
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: Brandy Waller, Robert Stewart MD\n', 'Reason:\n', '1. **Initial Voting Patterns**: On the first day, Cassandra Miller immediately voted for Alyssa Washington without any discussion, which could be seen as a random act or a diversion. However, the focus shifts when John Davis suggests voting for Patrick Ellis, and Robert Stewart MD quickly agrees. This early agreement without much discussion can be a tactic used by mafia members to control the narrative.\n', '\n', "2. **Brandy Waller's Behavior**: Brandy Waller quickly counters John Davis's suggestion by proposing to vote for John himself, which could be seen as an attempt to deflect suspicion or control the vote. She argues that John was the first to make a suggestion and is at the top of the list, which is a weak justification in the context of the game.\n", '\n', "3. **Outcome of First Day Vote**: The majority, including Robert Stewart MD and Alyssa Washington, followed John Davis's lead to vote out Patrick Ellis. This could indicate that John was not mafia, as mafia members often try to eliminate non-mafia players.\n", '\n', '4. **Nighttime Killings**: After Patrick Ellis is voted out, John Davis is killed during the night. If John were mafia, it would be unusual for the mafia to kill one of their own. This suggests that John was likely a bystander, and his early elimination from voting and subsequent killing might have been orchestrated by mafia members to remove suspicion from themselves.\n', '\n', '5. **Second Day Accusations and Voting**: On the second day, Brandy Waller quickly votes for Mary Mullins after the nighttime killing of John Davis, which could be seen as an attempt to sow confusion and misdirect the group. Her reasoning that it was "weird" they\'d eliminate the only other person with accusations is vague and could be a tactic to shift focus.\n', '\n', "6. **Robert Stewart MD's Consistent Agreement**: Robert Stewart MD consistently agrees with early accusations without contributing much to the discussion, which can be a strategy used by mafia members to appear engaged but not lead the conversation, thereby avoiding suspicion.\n", '\n', '7. **Final Voting and Behavior**: The final votes on the second day against Ms. Yvette Davis, led by Robert Stewart MD and followed by others including Alyssa Washington and Mary Mullins, further indicate a possible mafia strategy to eliminate non-threatening players while keeping the focus away from themselves.\n', '\n', "Based on these observations, Brandy Waller and Robert Stewart MD's actions and voting patterns suggest they could be working together as mafia, manipulating the voting and discussions to their advantage while maintaining a low profile in accusations and suspicions directed at them."]

Game 0707, Day 3:
 Actual Mafia: Alyssa Washington, Mary Mullins,  
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: Robert Stewart MD, Ms. Yvette Davis\n', 'Reason:\n', "1. **Initial Voting Patterns**: On the first day, the voting was primarily focused on Patrick Ellis and John Davis. Robert Stewart MD quickly agreed with John Davis to vote for Patrick Ellis, which could be a tactic to divert attention from themselves by agreeing with another player's suggestion.\n", '\n', '2. **Nighttime Killings**: After Patrick Ellis was voted out, John Davis, who was also a target during the day, was killed during the night. This could indicate that the mafia wanted to remove someone who was already under suspicion to confuse the remaining players.\n', '\n', "3. **Behavior of Ms. Yvette Davis**: Ms. Yvette Davis's behavior was somewhat erratic, with a lot of capitalized messages and less engagement in meaningful discussion. Her voting pattern and general disengagement could be a tactic to remain under the radar.\n", '\n', '4. **Subsequent Voting and Accusations**: On the second day, Robert Stewart MD quickly voted for Ms. Yvette Davis, which might have been an attempt to distance himself from his fellow mafia member once suspicion might fall on them. This is a common mafia tactic known as "bussing" (sacrificing one mafia member to clear the suspicion from another).\n', '\n', '5. **Final Day**: On the last day, Robert Stewart MD was voted out after being accused by both Mary Mullins and Alyssa Washington. His earlier agreement to vote out fellow players and the nighttime killings aligning with his interests (removing those who could suspect him) further supports the theory of his mafia role.\n', '\n', "6. **Game Outcome**: The game ends shortly after Robert Stewart MD is voted out, suggesting that his elimination was crucial for the bystanders' victory, confirming his role as mafia. The behavior and voting patterns of Ms. Yvette Davis, coupled with the strategic distancing by Robert Stewart MD, suggest she was the other mafia member."]

Game 0708, Day 1:
 Actual Mafia: Mariah Burke, Elizabeth Saunders,  
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: Elizabeth Saunders, Mariah Burke\n', 'Reason:\n', "1. Elizabeth Saunders' behavior during the daytime is suspicious. She laughs and makes light of the situation after a player is killed, which is unusual for a bystander who should typically show concern or fear.\n", '2. Elizabeth openly admits to being a part of the game in a non-serious manner, which could be interpreted as her admitting to being mafia, especially when she says "I am" after Jordan Rojas prompts for mafia to confess.\n', "3. Mariah Burke's behavior towards Elizabeth is also suspicious. Initially, she accuses Elizabeth of lacking compassion, which could be seen as trying to distance herself from another mafia member to avoid suspicion.\n", '4. Elizabeth\'s comment "me and Mariah" followed by a wink emoji suggests a possible alliance or connection, which in the context of the game, could imply they are both mafia.\n', "5. The voting pattern also supports this theory. Elizabeth votes non-seriously, and Mariah does not vote for Elizabeth until it's clear she is being targeted by others, which could be a strategic move to appear innocent.\n", "6. The overall interaction between Elizabeth and Mariah, combined with Elizabeth's behavior and the strategic voting, points to them being the mafia members in the game."]

Game 0708, Day 2:
 Actual Mafia: Mariah Burke, Elizabeth Saunders,  
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: Elizabeth Saunders, Mariah Burke\n', 'Reason:\n', '1. Elizabeth Saunders\' behavior during the daytime discussions is suspicious. She laughs and makes light of the situation after a player is killed, which is unusual for a bystander who should typically show concern or fear. Her comments like "hahaha" and "Yeeeet" after a death are inappropriate and could be an attempt to deflect suspicion or discomfort.\n', '\n', '2. Elizabeth openly admits to being part of the game in a non-serious manner, saying "I am" when Jordan Rojas asks players to confess if they are mafia. Although this could be interpreted as joking, it aligns with her earlier nonchalant and mocking attitude towards the game\'s serious events.\n', '\n', '3. Mariah Burke\'s interaction with Elizabeth Saunders raises suspicion. When Elizabeth says, "me and Mariah," followed by a wink, it suggests a possible collusion. Although it could be interpreted as playful, in the context of the game, it might hint at their roles as mafia working together.\n', '\n', "4. Mariah Burke's behavior in later discussions also adds to the suspicion. She quickly jumps to accuse others, like Michelle Graham, and tries to direct the group's suspicion towards her. This could be a tactic to divert attention from herself and possibly protect her fellow mafia member.\n", '\n', "5. The voting patterns and the reactions to the votes also provide clues. Elizabeth and Mariah seem to be steering the conversation and influencing votes, which is a common strategy used by mafia members to control the game's outcome.\n", '\n', '6. After Elizabeth is voted out, the nighttime killing of Ryan Richardson, who voted against Elizabeth, could be seen as a revenge act by the remaining mafia, possibly Mariah, indicating her involvement in the mafia team.']

Game 0708, Day 3:
 Actual Mafia: Mariah Burke, Elizabeth Saunders,  
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: Elizabeth Saunders, Michelle Graham\n', 'Reason:\n', '1. Elizabeth Saunders\' behavior during the daytime discussions was suspicious. She was laughing and making light of the situation after a player was killed, which is unusual for a bystander who should typically show concern. Her comments like "hahaha" and "Yeeeet" after a death indicate a lack of empathy, aligning more with a mafia mindset trying to downplay the severity of the situation.\n', '\n', '2. Elizabeth also hinted at her role indirectly through statements like "I am" and "kick me out for that moneyy" when pressured by other players, suggesting she might be admitting her role as mafia in a non-serious manner, which players often do to deflect suspicion ironically.\n', '\n', '3. Michelle Graham\'s behavior was also indicative of mafia behavior. Her initial reaction to Mark Parker\'s death was inappropriate, saying "Glad he\'s gone. He gave me crabs," which is a callous remark uncharacteristic of a bystander. \n', '\n', '4. Throughout the game, Michelle remained relatively quiet and did not contribute significantly to finding the mafia, which can be a strategy used by mafia members to avoid drawing attention to themselves.\n', '\n', '5. Michelle\'s voting pattern and defensive remarks when accused ("This is such a stupid game. I\'m a bystander, but kill me anyways, want to get on with my day") also align with a mafia member trying to appear disinterested or reverse-psychology to avoid suspicion.\n', '\n', "6. The combination of Elizabeth's overt suspicious behavior and Michelle's subtle, defensive gameplay suggests they were working together as mafia, with Elizabeth drawing attention and Michelle staying under the radar."]

Game 0708, Day 4:
 Actual Mafia: Mariah Burke, Elizabeth Saunders,  
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: Elizabeth Saunders, Michelle Graham\n', 'Reason:\n', '1. Elizabeth Saunders displayed a lack of compassion and inappropriate humor about the killings, which is often a tactic used by mafia to deflect suspicion or downplay the severity of the situation.\n', '2. Elizabeth openly admitted to being the mafia in a joking manner, which could be a slip or a bluff, but her overall behavior aligns with someone trying to disrupt the game, typical of a mafia role.\n', "3. Michelle Graham also displayed odd behavior by expressing relief at a player's death and later showing disinterest in the game, which can be a strategy to appear disengaged and less threatening.\n", "4. Michelle's voting pattern and comments during the game did not contribute constructively to finding the mafia, which could be a tactic to avoid drawing attention to herself while subtly influencing the direction of the game.\n", "5. The interactions between other players and Elizabeth, as well as the suspicion towards Michelle, support the theory that both were working to manipulate the game's outcome, consistent with mafia behavior."]

Game 0709, Day 1:
 Actual Mafia: Alexander Dillon, Garrett Baker,  
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: Cathy Lopez, Garrett Baker\n', 'Reason:\n', "1. **Cathy Lopez's Immediate Accusation**: Cathy starts the day by immediately naming James Smith, which could be an attempt to divert attention from herself and put it on someone else, a common mafia tactic.\n", "2. **Garrett Baker's Voting Behavior**: Garrett quickly supports the vote against Ryan Ray, who was actively participating and trying to figure out the mafia. Mafia members often try to eliminate those who are actively accusing or close to discovering their identity.\n", '3. **Defensive Actions**: Both Cathy and Garrett focus on getting Ryan Ray out after he starts to push for Cathy being mafia. This could indicate they are working together to remove a threat to their safety.\n', '4. **Voting Patterns**: Cathy and Garrett both consistently push for Ryan Ray\'s elimination, aligning their actions which could suggest a mafia collaboration. Cathy also tries to rally more votes against Ryan by stating, "Let\'s eliminate Ryan," further indicating her possible role in trying to control the vote.\n', '5. **Lack of Suspicion on Each Other**: Neither Cathy nor Garrett express any suspicion towards each other throughout the dialogue, which might indicate a mutual understanding or alliance typical of mafia members trying to avoid casting doubt on each other.']

Game 0709, Day 2:
 Actual Mafia: Alexander Dillon, Garrett Baker,  
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: James Smith, Steven Brown\n', 'Reason:\n', "1. **James Smith's Defensive Behavior**: Early in the game, Ryan Ray expressed distrust towards James Smith, which led to a defensive response from James. This kind of defensive behavior can be indicative of a mafia member trying to deflect suspicion.\n", '\n', '2. **Voting Patterns and Accusations**: During the first voting session, there was a split between votes for Ryan Ray and Cathy Lopez. James Smith eventually voted for Cathy Lopez, which could be seen as an attempt to appear as if he is targeting another mafia, thus reducing suspicion on himself. This tactic is common among mafia members to create confusion and misdirect the real target.\n', '\n', "3. **Steven Brown's Ambiguous Role**: Steven Brown's behavior and voting were somewhat ambiguous, which is often a strategy used by mafia members to avoid drawing attention. His vote for James Smith when the majority were voting for Ryan Ray or Cathy Lopez could be seen as a strategic move to appear as if he is not aligned with the mafia.\n", '\n', '4. **Outcome of Night Actions**: After Ryan Ray and Cathy Lopez were voted out on successive days, and both were not mafia, it suggests that the mafia were successful in manipulating the votes to eliminate non-mafia players. Given that James and Steven survived these rounds without drawing substantial suspicion or correct identification as mafia, it points towards their possible involvement in these manipulations.\n', '\n', '5. **General Observation of Game Dynamics**: Throughout the game, both James Smith and Steven Brown managed to avoid being the main suspects in discussions and votes, which is characteristic of mafia members who are effectively steering the conversation away from themselves and towards other non-threatening players.\n', '\n', 'These observations, based on the defensive responses, voting patterns, and the outcomes of night actions, lead to the conclusion that James Smith and Steven Brown are likely the mafia members in this game.']

Game 0710, Day 1:
 Actual Mafia: Christine Peterson, Louis Webb,  
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: Abigail Perez, Louis Webb\n', 'Reason:\n', '1. The game starts with the nighttime ending and Henry Bowers being killed. This indicates that the mafia made a kill during the night.\n', '2. During the daytime, multiple players vote for Justin Rivas Jr., suggesting suspicion towards him. However, Trevor Brown suddenly accuses Abigail Perez of being mafia without prior discussion or suspicion directed towards her.\n', "3. Louis Webb agrees with Trevor's accusation against Abigail, which could be an attempt to deflect suspicion from himself or another mafia member by agreeing with a seemingly baseless accusation.\n", "4. The voting pattern is also telling. Initially, Justin Rivas Jr. receives a majority of votes, but after Trevor's accusation, the votes shift towards Abigail Perez. This shift could indicate a strategic move by the mafia to confuse the bystanders.\n", "5. Louis Webb, despite the majority voting for Justin, chooses to vote for Abigail after Trevor's accusation. This could be an attempt to appear as if he is not aligned with Justin, potentially masking his mafia role.\n", "6. The final votes result in Justin being voted out, but the suspicion and shift towards Abigail, along with Louis's behavior, suggest that both Abigail and Louis could be working together as mafia, trying to manipulate the voting and discussion to protect themselves and eliminate a bystander (Justin)."]

Game 0710, Day 2:
 Actual Mafia: Christine Peterson, Louis Webb,  
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: Abigail Perez, Louis Webb\n', 'Reason:\n', '1. **Abigail Perez** was consistently suspected by multiple players throughout the game. Initially, Trevor Brown directly accused her of being mafia, which was supported by Louis Webb. Despite the suspicion, she tried to deflect by voting for Jordan Vincent later, which is a common tactic used by mafia members to create confusion and shift blame.\n', '\n', '2. **Louis Webb**\'s behavior was suspicious, particularly in how he interacted with other players. He agreed with Trevor\'s accusation against Abigail, which could be seen as an attempt to appear as a concerned bystander. However, his later actions, such as voting against the majority when Justin Rivas Jr. was being voted out and his comment "That\'s what somebody in the mafia would say!" when Abigail claimed to be a bystander, suggest he was trying to manipulate the narrative and distance himself from her as suspicions against her grew.\n', '\n', '3. The voting patterns also provide clues. Louis Webb initially did not join the majority when they were voting out Justin Rivas Jr., which could indicate an attempt to save a fellow mafia member or simply to not appear aligned with any particular group. His later vote against Abigail could be seen as a last-ditch effort to save himself once it became clear she was going to be voted out.\n', '\n', '4. The nighttime killings also align with the suspicions. After Trevor accused Abigail, he was killed the following night, which could be interpreted as the mafia silencing a player who was correctly identifying them.\n', '\n', "5. Abigail's defensive and accusatory behavior in the later stages, particularly her claim that Jordan is a mobster without much basis, aligns with common mafia tactics of deflecting suspicion and sowing discord among bystanders."]

Game 0710, Day 3:
 Actual Mafia: Christine Peterson, Louis Webb,  
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: Louis Webb, Christina Figueroa\n', 'Reason:\n', '1. **Louis Webb\'s Responses**: Louis\'s response to Trevor\'s question about being a bystander was evasive ("No I\'m a voter"), which is not a direct denial of being mafia. His laughter ("lol") when Justin Rivas Jr. was trying to clarify a point also seems to trivialize the situation, which could be a tactic to deflect suspicion.\n', '\n', '2. **Voting Patterns**: Louis initially voted for Abigail Perez after Trevor accused her of being mafia. This could be seen as trying to shift blame away from himself or an associate. His behavior in the voting phase, where he switches targets, could be a strategy to confuse the other players.\n', '\n', '3. **Christina Figueroa\'s Accusations and Voting**: Christina quickly jumped on the bandwagon to vote for Justin Rivas Jr. after he was accused, which might indicate a rush to eliminate a bystander. Her question about Kevin Pearson ("what about kevin?") when the focus was on Abigail Perez could be an attempt to divert attention from herself or her mafia partner.\n', '\n', "4. **General Game Dynamics**: The mafia would benefit from sowing confusion and misdirection. Both Louis and Christina's actions contribute to a chaotic and uncertain game environment, which is advantageous for the mafia. Their interactions and voting seem to strategically align with causing mistrust among other players.\n", '\n', '5. **Outcome of Night Actions**: The nighttime killings of Henry Bowers, Trevor Brown, and Jordan Vincent, followed by daytime discussions and voting, did not implicate Louis or Christina directly, but their survival and the pattern of their interactions raise suspicion. Their survival while other more actively accused players were killed or voted out could indicate that they were working together to manipulate the outcomes.\n', '\n', 'These observations suggest that Louis Webb and Christina Figueroa were likely working together as mafia, using tactics of misdirection, strategic voting, and manipulation of the dialogue to achieve their goals.']

Game 0711, Day 1:
 Actual Mafia: Tiffany Hill, Cody Garner,  
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: Cody Garner, Tiffany Hill\n', 'Reason:\n', '1. Jose Gonzalez was killed during the night, and his last vote was for Cody Garner, which might suggest suspicion towards Cody.\n', '2. During the daytime, Cody Garner voted for Peter Perez, which could be seen as an attempt to deflect suspicion from himself by targeting someone else.\n', '3. Dr. Amy Mcdaniel, who was later voted out, also voted for Cody Garner, further indicating that Cody might be a mafia member, as mafia often try to eliminate those who suspect them.\n', '4. Tiffany Hill voted for Dr. Amy Mcdaniel, who was expressing suspicion and voting against Cody Garner. This action by Tiffany could be interpreted as trying to protect Cody by removing someone targeting him.\n', '5. The voting pattern shows that both Cody and Tiffany were involved in voting against individuals who were either suspicious of Cody or were actively voting against him, which aligns with typical mafia behavior of protecting each other and eliminating threats to their group.']

Game 0711, Day 2:
 Actual Mafia: Tiffany Hill, Cody Garner,  
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: Cody Garner, Peter Perez\n', 'Reason:\n', "1. **Jose Gonzalez's Vote**: Jose Gonzalez voted for Cody Garner before being killed at night. This could indicate that Jose suspected Cody of being mafia.\n", '2. **Cody\'s Reaction and Vote**: Cody Garner\'s reaction to Dr. Amy Mcdaniel\'s vote ("that\'s not nice, dr. amy!") could be seen as an attempt to deflect suspicion from himself. Additionally, Cody voted for Peter Perez, which might be an attempt to spread suspicion to others and away from himself.\n', "3. **Peter Perez's Vote**: Peter voted for Tiffany Hill, which did not align with any previous suspicions or discussions, potentially indicating an attempt to divert attention from himself and his mafia partner.\n", '4. **Voting Patterns and Accusations**: Dr. Amy Mcdaniel, who was voted out and claimed to be a bystander, voted for Cody Garner, further supporting the suspicion against Cody. The fact that she was voted out after voting for Cody could indicate that mafia members pushed for her elimination to reduce suspicion on Cody.\n', '5. **Nighttime Killings**: The nighttime killings of Jose Gonzalez and Suzanne Moore, who had not been central in any accusations or discussions, suggest that the mafia were removing players who might not have been vocal or suspicious enough to defend themselves effectively, a common mafia tactic to reduce the number of bystanders quietly.\n', "6. **General Behavior**: Cody's and Peter's interactions and voting seemed more directed at creating confusion and misdirection, typical strategies used by mafia members to keep the focus off themselves."]

Game 0712, Day 1:
 Actual Mafia: Amy Lewis, Riley Webster,  
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: Amy Lewis, Riley Webster\n', 'Reason:\n', "1. **Jamie Sanchez's Accusation**: Jamie accused Amy Lewis and Riley Webster of being mafia early in the day. This kind of direct accusation can sometimes come from a bystander who is observing the game closely.\n", '\n', '2. **Voting Patterns**: The voting pattern provides significant clues. Amy Lewis and Riley Webster did not vote for each other, which could indicate they are avoiding casting suspicion on each other as mafia members often do.\n', '\n', '3. **Amy Lewis\'s Confession**: Amy Lewis sarcastically saying "yeah i\'m mafia vote for me" after being accused could be a reverse psychology tactic, trying to deflect suspicion by seeming too obvious.\n', '\n', "4. **Riley Webster's Defensive Behavior**: Riley's immediate reaction to vote against Jamie Sanchez after Jamie accused him and Amy Lewis suggests a defensive move. Mafia members often try to eliminate those who accuse them to reduce suspicion and remove threats.\n", '\n', '5. **Riley Webster\'s Comment**: Riley\'s comment "Say goodnight" after voting could be interpreted as a hint of confidence in the mafia\'s position in the game, possibly knowing that another bystander (Damon Ryan) was about to be eliminated.\n', '\n', '6. **Lack of Solid Defense**: Neither Amy nor Riley provided a solid defense against the accusations, which is often seen in mafia players who are trying to lay low or redirect focus without drawing too much attention to themselves.\n', '\n', 'These observations lead to the conclusion that Amy Lewis and Riley Webster are likely the mafia members in this game.']

Game 0712, Day 2:
 Actual Mafia: Amy Lewis, Riley Webster,  
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: Amy Lewis, Riley Webster\n', 'Reason:\n', "1. **Jamie Sanchez's Accusation**: Jamie accused Amy Lewis and Riley Webster of being mafia early in the game. This kind of direct accusation is often based on observations of voting patterns and interactions among players.\n", '\n', '2. **Amy Lewis\'s Confession**: Amy Lewis sarcastically said, "yeah i\'m mafia vote for me," which could be interpreted as a reverse psychology tactic often used by mafia members to seem less suspicious.\n', '\n', '3. **Voting Patterns**: \n', '   - Riley Webster consistently voted against those who were accusing or suspected by others to be mafia (voted for Jamie Sanchez after Jamie accused him and Amy).\n', '   - Amy Lewis voted for Damon Ryan initially, aligning with the majority to possibly blend in, and later voted for Jamie Sanchez, potentially to eliminate someone who was onto her.\n', '\n', '4. **Survival and Elimination**:\n', '   - Both Amy Lewis and Riley Webster survived multiple rounds of voting despite suspicions, which could indicate they were successful in deflecting suspicion or manipulating the voting.\n', '   - Key accusers of Amy and Riley, like Jamie Sanchez, were eliminated, which could suggest a strategic removal of threats by mafia members.\n', '\n', '5. **Behavior and Interaction**:\n', "   - Riley's and Amy's interactions and responses in the dialogue do not strongly defend their innocence but rather navigate through accusations subtly, which aligns with typical mafia behavior trying to maintain a low profile while influencing decisions.\n", '\n', 'These observations lead to the conclusion that Amy Lewis and Riley Webster are the most likely mafia members based on their actions, voting patterns, and survival in the game despite being suspected.']

Game 0712, Day 3:
 Actual Mafia: Amy Lewis, Riley Webster,  
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: Amy Lewis, Riley Webster\n', 'Reason:\n', '1. **Amy Lewis\'s Confession**: Amy Lewis explicitly states, "yeah i\'m mafia vote for me" which is a direct confession, albeit possibly sarcastic. However, considering the context and subsequent actions, it seems to be a truthful slip.\n', '\n', '2. **Voting Patterns and Accusations**:\n', '   - **Amy Lewis** voted for Damon Ryan, who was eventually voted out and later for Jamie Sanchez, another player who was voted out. Her voting pattern aligns with targeting players who were not mafia.\n', "   - **Riley Webster** voted for Jamie Sanchez and was active in directing suspicion towards other players like Jamie and William Frank MD. Riley's consistent push against Jamie, who was eventually voted out, aligns with a strategy to eliminate non-mafia players.\n", '\n', '3. **Behavior During Discussions**:\n', "   - **Amy Lewis** and **Riley Webster** both engage in behavior that deflects suspicion from themselves. Amy's overt confession could be seen as a reverse psychology tactic, while Riley's active participation in directing the vote against other players helps to steer the group's decisions without drawing attention to himself.\n", '\n', '4. **Outcome of Night Actions**:\n', '   - After key players like Damon Ryan and Jamie Sanchez were voted out, the nighttime actions continued to eliminate non-mafia players, suggesting that those orchestrating the votes (like Amy and Riley) were likely mafia, as their targets during the day were not mafia and thus posed a threat to them.\n', '\n', '5. **Final Analysis**:\n', "   - The combination of Amy's confession, both Amy's and Riley's voting patterns, and their strategic manipulation of daytime discussions strongly indicates their roles as mafia.

 Actual Mafia: Laura Pena, Zachary Hurley,  
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: Laura Pena, Valerie White\n', 'Reason:\n', "1. Laura Pena quickly agrees with Valerie White's suggestion to suspect Johnny Stevens as mafia, which could be a tactic to divert attention from themselves.\n", '2.

Game 0714, Day 1:
 Actual Mafia: Richard Stevens, Jessica Michael,  
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: Deborah Alvarez, Shane Landry\n', 'Reason:\n', '1. Deborah Alvarez was very quick to accuse Patrick Gonzales of being mafia without providing any substantial evidence, simply stating "Patrick Gonzales is next" and later calling him "Dirty Mafia." This kind of aggressive and unsubstantiated accusation is often a tactic used by mafia members to divert attention from themselves.\n', '\n', '2. Shane Landry immediately supported Deborah\'s accusation by voting for Patrick Gonzales right after her and continued to push for his elimination without questioning or discussing it further. His behavior, "I just have that feeling about Patrick" and "get him!" suggests a coordinated effort to eliminate a bystander, which is typical of mafia behavior to secure their numbers advantage.\n', '\n', "3. Both Deborah and Shane did not respond to Tammy Weaver's questioning of why Patrick Gonzales was being targeted, which could indicate they didn't have a valid reason other than him being a potential threat to their mafia roles.\n", '\n', '4. Nicole Barker and Angela Murphy, along with others, started suspecting Deborah Alvarez towards the end of the discussion, suggesting her behavior might be indicative of a mafia role. Nicole specifically pointed out that Deborah was "throwing people under the bus," a common mafia strategy to sow discord and confusion.\n', '\n', '5. Shane\'s behavior throughout the discussion, including his nonchalant and somewhat mocking responses like "X)" and "this is gold," further suggests a lack of genuine concern for finding the mafia, which is not typical of a bystander\'s approach to preserving their safety in the game.']
