Pattern 1: Coordinated voting on innocent targets  
Count: 14 transcripts  
Reason and Evidence: Time and again, the observer flags pairs of players who “both voted for” or “rode the bandwagon” to lynch a bystander, interpreting that as classic mafia coordination. For example:  
  • Game 0632 Day 1 (transcript #3): “Alex and Tyler… both cast their votes [for Elliot], and this coordination is typical of mafia working together.”  
  • Game 0634 Day 1 (#9): “Both Alex and Stevie conspicuously cast their day-votes on Elliot… By jointly pushing for Elliot… they shape the narrative to deflect attention from themselves.”  
  • Game 0635 Day 1 (#12): “On Day 1 they were the only two who voted together to lynch Alex (an innocent)… classic mafia behavior to bandwagon an innocent while staying ‘clean.’ ”  
  • Game 0636 Day 2 (#16): “The only two votes on Alex came from River and Brook—strongly suggesting they were secretly aligned.”  
  • Game 0637 Day 1 (#19): “During the day Stevie and River were the only ones to vote for Noah. That night the mafia killed Noah, matching the pair’s voting target.”  
  …plus nine more transcripts in which the observer leans on “they both voted for/by the majority on an innocent” to indict a duo.

Pattern 2: Deflective, non-committal chat style  
Count: 58 transcripts  
Reason and Evidence: In the majority of write-ups, the observer highlights suspects’ use of “generic,” “broad,” or “echoing” statements—urging the town to “watch quiet players,” “look at steering,” or “ask for everyone’s gut feelings”—instead of naming concrete suspicions. This is repeatedly labeled a mafia tactic for steering discussion while flying under the radar. Examples:  
  • Game 0631 Day 1 (#1): “Tyler’s play-style matched typical mafia behavior… they spoke a lot with broad, general advice, deflected direct scrutiny with humor… yet steered the group onto other targets.”  
  • Game 0632 Day 3 (#5): “Both Stevie and River repeatedly urged… without ever putting their own names in play. That is classic mafia behavior.”  
  • Game 0633 Day 1 (#6): “Both repeatedly deflected suspicion onto the quieter players… a classic mafia tactic: steer the town’s attention elsewhere.”  
  • Game 0640 Day 3 (#31): “River and Stevie continually kept the conversation going with open‐ended prompts but never committed to accusing anyone.”  
  • Game 0658 Day 3 (#87): “Brook and River… never drew sustained scrutiny, even though they were unusually quick to propose vote targets… deflecting.”  
  …and dozens more transcripts invoking the same “vague steering ≈ mafia” rationale.

Pattern 3: Night-kill profiling  
Count: 51 transcripts  
Reason and Evidence: Over half the justifications incorporate the profile of whom the mafia chose to murder overnight—often a vocal bystander or someone who had been zeroing in on the suspects—as a key tell. Representative citations:  
  • Game 0631 Day 1 (#1): “At night the mafia killed Adrian, one of the most vocal town contributors… more consistent with mafia removing a threat.”  
  • Game 0632 Day 2 (#4): “The mafia’s night kills hit the most vocal bystanders (Adrian, then Alex), removing strong analysts.”  
  • Game 0636 Day 1 (#15): “The night kill (Adrian) was a bystander who had been vocal about watching ‘eager accusers’… so the mafia silenced a potential threat.”  
  • Game 0645 Day 1 (#45): “That night the mafia killed Elliot—one of River’s voters—consistent with mafia targeting someone who threatened them by voting River.”  
  • Game 0657 Day 3 (#84): “After Day 3’s vote, Ronny… was killed that night—consistent with them silencing the one player who had correctly pegged a mafia.”  
  …plus dozens more uses of who was killed at night to confirm which players must be mafia.

Pattern 4: Zero-vote / un-suspected players  
Count: 5 transcripts  
Reason and Evidence: A smaller but recurring motif is that true mafia will “fly under the radar” by never drawing a single vote. The observer points out players who received zero votes across a day (or days) as prime suspects. Instances:  
  • Game 0631 Day 1 (#1): “Tyler received zero votes despite being heavily discussed… Combining Tyler’s unassailable voting record… Tyler fits the profile.”  
  • Game 0632 Day 2 (#4): “No one voted for Stevie on either Day 1 or Day 2, and Brook likewise escaped any votes… Innocents tend to draw some heat.”  
  • Game 0639 Day 3 (#27): “No one suspected Noah… Noah never received a vote in the last round.”  
  • Game 0640 Day 1 (#29): “Only Alex and Elliot received zero votes during Day 1… that consistent absence of suspicion points to them.”  
  • Game 0664 Day 3 (#108): “At every lynch… the two surviving mafia never drew a single vote against them.”  

Pattern 5: Mirrored phrasing and “echo” behavior  
Count: 7 transcripts  
Reason and Evidence: In several cases the observer calls out near-verbatim echoes or identical “detective hat” phrasing as evidence of pre-coordination. Examples:  
  • Game 0633 Day 1 (#6): “River and Whitney posted near-identical ‘detective hat’ messages in succession—an uncanny mirror that looks like pre-coordination.”  
  • Game 0644 Day 1 (#42): “Both Brook and Tyler repeatedly chimed in with nearly identical phrasing and timing—raising the classic ‘echo’ red flag for collusion.”  
  • Game 0632 Day 3 (#5): “Throughout discussion, both Stevie and River repeatedly urged the table to ‘watch the quiet ones’… without ever putting their own names in play.”  
  • Game 0652 Day 2 (#68): “Elliot then cast the lone vote on River… and River immediately voted for Elliot in turn. That mutual echo of votes strongly points to Elliot as the remaining mafia.”  
  • Game 0658 Day 3 (#87): “Brook and River… their mutual reinforcement of each other’s suggestions… matches the classic mafia play.”  
  …and two more transcripts citing the same echo-and-mirror effect.
