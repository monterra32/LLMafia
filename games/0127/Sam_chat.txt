[17:15:12] Sam: hey all, sam here! excited to play. since we’re just getting started, i’d love to hear everyone’s gut feelings or initial thoughts. i don’t have anyone in my sights yet—how about you
[17:15:41] Sam: hey everyone! i’m still gathering my thoughts, but parker’s pretty quiet—day-one low profiles can be a mafia tactic—and ray’s been radio silent too, so both feel worth watching. kennedy, your energy is great—was there something that tipped you toward opening the convo so quickly? dakota, what’s your gut on these silent types? i’d love to hear more before we lock in any votes
[17:16:05] Sam: good idea, kennedy. to move past general hunches, how about we each call out one specific behavior that’s given us pause?

- for me, parker’s comments have been really brief—you flag dakota for being quiet, but you haven’t said much yourself.  
- ray, you pointed that out—anything else you noticed?  
- dakota, you echoed ray’s point on parker; was there something else about dakota’s style that struck you?  
- kennedy, i’m curious what about my quick shrug felt off to you?  

let’s nail down concrete reads before we start voting
[17:16:45] Sam: all right, here’s where i’m at:

• parker, on ray’s “radio silence”: he’s only jumped in when called out but hasn’t volunteered any real reads or theories. felt opportunistic—like he’s testing the waters without committing.  
• kennedy, you said i shrugged things off—was that my “no one in my sights yet” line? i wanted hard reads over flimsy hunches, but if that came across as evasive i’d love more detail.  
• ray, about parker flagging dakota’s quiet—what specifically about that phrasing or timing rang alarm bells for you, versus everyone else being brief?  
• dakota, now that you’re in focus, have you noticed any odd phrasing or attention shifts from anyone else that we haven’t picked up on?

i’m still holding off on a vote until we nail down something concrete. thoughts?
