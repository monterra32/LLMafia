[17:15:27] Ray: hey everyone, ray here—day 1, let’s do this! no obvious suspects yet, but i noticed parker’s been super quiet. classic strategy to lay low… or hiding something? parker, what’re your thoughts? and what about the rest of you—any gut feelings
[17:15:45] Ray: ray: hey everyone, ray here! i actually find parker’s quick call on dakota a bit odd—day 1 nerves could explain the quiet. why single dakota out so fast, parker? sam, kennedy, what’s your take? and dakota, now that you’ve been spotlighted, do you feel there’s any real reason to suspect you (or was it just nerves)? let’s get a few more thoughts before locking in any hunches
[17:16:14] Ray: ray: hey team, i know i was quick to jump on parker earlier, but i promise i’m not laying low—i was just curious to hear everyone’s takes. that said, i’m finding sam’s eagerness to zero in on parker & me a bit bold for day 1. sam, what prompted you to single us out so fast? and kennedy, you kicked things off—purely social or also probing for reactions? dakota, where’s your gut right now with all these initial hunches flying around? personally, i think it’s too early to make a confident vote today—maybe we let more slip before we lynch. thoughts
[17:16:43] Ray: hey everyone, ray here—good points so far. parker, you’ve been awfully quiet this whole phase; i get that day-one nerves are real, but in a game built on info­sharing that silence feels more tactical than timid. what’s your read on sam or kennedy so far? throw us a hunch so we know where you stand. dakota, you were first to back me up on parker—aside from the quiet, what else struck you there? sam, kennedy, do you buy the silence theory or is there another behavior we should be digging into
[17:19:37] Ray: ray: hey everyone—final three now, one mafia among us. kennedy, you did most of the surgical breakdown of our day-one hunches—that felt more tactical than a genuine gut-check. dakota, i’ve heard you stay supportive but with no solid reads. i’m voting kennedy unless dakota spots something i’ve missed. dakota, what’s your final read
[17:20:14] Ray: ray: okay, razor-sharp time. i’m siding with dakota as our suspect:

1. dakota’s been the one aggressively tying my “too early” caution and vote on parker to the kill of sam—but sam hardly even focused on me, so why would mafia pick her? my parker vote came only after she couldn’t back up any solid reads, not to cover a retribution kill.

2. from the jump, dakota has lobbed one-liners (“that abrupt flip feels like misdirection”) without any concrete examples beyond “i feel it.” meanwhile kennedy has consistently pressed for specifics and followed through with detailed reads.

kennedy, you’ve spent the entire day asking for behaviors and evidence—do you see the same lack of substance in dakota’s case against me? if so, let’s lock in dakota. if not, lay out exactly what you’re seeing in my words
