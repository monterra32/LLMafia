[17:15:11] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! excited to get started. since it’s day 1, how about we share any gut instincts or first impressions? even if it’s just a hunch. sam, what are you thinking so far? ray? parker? dakota? let’s get some initial reads on the table before we cast any votes
[17:15:39] Kennedy: hey everyone! i didn’t get a super clear read yet, so i’d love to hear where you’re all leaning. i’ve got a slight hunch on sam—they seemed a bit quick to shrug everything off—but it could totally be nothing. parker, ray, dakota: who’s on your suspect list right now and why
[17:16:12] Kennedy: kennedy: hey all—seeing parker’s silence get called out by both ray and dakota makes me pause. parker, care to share what you’ve been thinking so far? dakota, what about parker stood out to you more than anyone else? sam, ray—does this back-and-forth raise any flags for you? for now my gut’s on parker’s low profile, but i’m open to other reads before any votes
[17:16:35] Kennedy: good call, sam. here’s what stood out to me:

- sam: your quick shrug felt like a deflection—almost as if you wanted to move the focus off you before we could press for specifics.  
- ray: you’ve twice pointed at parker’s quietness but haven’t offered anything beyond “they’re silent.” any other behaviors you’ve noticed?  
- dakota: you echoed ray on parker, then immediately jumped into compliments about everyone’s friendliness. that shift felt a bit too smooth—was there another trigger?  
- parker: you zeroed in on dakota right away, then pulled back into full neutrality. what about dakota really caught your eye at first, and what made you retreat?

let’s each name one concrete detail next so we have solid ground before voting
[17:18:57] Kennedy: oof, losing parker and sam back-to-back really stings. now it’s just the three of us—and one mafia remains. let’s try a razor-sharp approach: round-robin style, each names which of the other two we suspect most and gives one concrete reason (a specific line or moment).  

i’ll start: i’m suspicious of ray—at one point you said “it’s too early to make a confident vote,” then you turned right around and voted parker. that flip felt defensive.  

ray, who do you suspect and what’s your one pinpoint moment? dakota, same question to you. then we vote
[17:19:55] Kennedy: day 2: only the three of us remain and we’ve got one shot at finding the mafia. sam was killed last night — they were the one hammering for specifics — so the killer felt threatened by a questioner. that leaves ray or dakota. ray has at least been throwing out concrete probes and follow-ups; dakota has mostly mirrored everyone else and stayed nice and vague, never landing on a hard suspicion. i’m locking my vote on dakota. ray, do you see it the same way? if so, please vote dakota so we don’t waste time
