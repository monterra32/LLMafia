[17:15:19] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here—excited for day 1! we don’t have much to go on yet, so let’s get everyone’s gut reads. ray, what’s your first impression? parker? sam? kennedy? share any little thing that’s felt off or friendly so far before we start voting
[17:15:35] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here! i’m really enjoying the friendly vibes so far. i don’t have any solid reads yet, but i did notice parker’s been pretty quiet—could just be taking it all in, but i’d love to hear your thoughts, parker. ray’s questions have been spot-on, and sam and kennedy seem super welcoming. what’s everyone else picking up? let’s keep the convo rolling before we jump into votes
[17:16:38] Dakota: dakota: thanks for steering us to specifics, parker. here’s what i’m seeing so far:

• sam—you’ve been keen to spotlight quiet players. can you point to any particular comment or tone that set off your alarm?  
• kennedy—you flagged my quick shrug as odd. which line struck you that way?  
• ray—you first suspected parker, then me, then urged caution for everyone. what detail made you change course?  
• parker—you’ve been calm and observant—anything beyond our silences that caught your eye?

i’m leaning toward holding off on votes until we’ve got clear examples. what do you all think?
[17:19:07] Dakota: hey everyone, day 2 and it’s down to the three of us: ray, kennedy and me—with one mafia among you two. we’ve got to pick a target soon. 

ray, you voted parker on day 1 then stayed quiet after sam flagged you—last night sam got killed, which fits a mafia retribution on the one person pointing at you. what made you want parker that strongly, and what specific read do you have on kennedy that clears them? 

kennedy, you shrugged off ray’s silence pretty early and steered attention elsewhere—what keeps you from zeroing in on ray’s low profile? 

i’m leaning hard toward ray based on the kill pattern and his radio silence, and unless i get something solid to the contrary i’ll cast my vote there. kennedy, are you with me? let’s hear final thoughts and lock in our vote
[17:19:35] Dakota: i’m suspicious of ray—just moments before the vote you said “it’s too early to make a confident vote,” urging caution, then you immediately cast your vote for parker with no new reads. that abrupt flip feels less like genuine hesitation and more like misdirection
