[12:04:06] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! since we’re just kicking off day 1, we don’t have much to go on yet. how about we each share a quick gut impression—just one person you find intriguing or a little suspicious? i’ll start: i’m pretty neutral right now, but i’m curious to hear from adrian or sidney. who wants to go next
[12:04:24] Parker: hey everyone—parker here, sorry for the quiet start, just getting my bearings. right now i’m leaning toward tyler’s eagerness feeling a bit forced (could be a deflection tactic day 1), and i’m curious about sidney’s near-silence—shy or hiding something? kennedy’s also been quiet so far. drew, finley, what do you think of those reads? let’s get a few more impressions before we start locking in a vote
[12:04:43] Parker: parker: hey everyone, sorry for being so quiet—i got pulled into something irl just now. for my one pick, i’m going to say tyler. they’ve been super eager to direct suspicion at quieter players (me, sidney) and steer our gut-reads, which feels like a classic deflection play. i’ll cast my vote in that direction for now—keen to hear kennedy’s thoughts too
[12:04:59] Parker: hey everyone, sorry i haven’t given a solid read yet. looking back through the thread, the person whose behavior really stands out is tyler. in his very first post he singled me out as “jumping in awfully fast… maybe deflecting,” then in the next round of calls to vote he framed my neutrality as “extreme” again—without ever giving any concrete reasoning beyond my activity level. that feels like he’s trying to steer the narrative onto me instead of offering any real analysis of others. i’m going to put tyler on my suspect list for now. does anyone else see something in his wording or timing, or have another strong read to share
[12:05:40] Parker: i’m casting my vote for tyler—they’ve been the loudest voice pushing suspicion on quieter players like me and sidney without offering any specifics. tyler: which exact phrase in my messages made you think i was hiding something—was it my “just getting my bearings” comment or something else? and adrian/kennedy/finley/drew: does tyler’s eagerness to herd us into a quick lynch feel off to you too? let’s get concrete reasons on the table before anyone else votes
[12:06:05] Parker: i’m locking in my vote on tyler. from his very first “maybe deflecting?” jab at me through his nonstop steering of the convo without a single concrete quote feels like classic deflection. who else is on tyler? if you’ve got a different solid read, speak up now before we finalize
[12:11:05] Parker: aw man, so sad to see drew gone—he was pushing us for concrete reads, and i bet the mafia wanted to shut that down. my one-line hunch: sidney—she’s slipped back into radio silence even after the kill. adrian, finley, kennedy—drop your one-liner suspect + why and let’s see if any names pop up more than once
[12:11:39] Parker: parker: one name, one line – sidney: you accused me of “stall-and-deflect” about my first post but never quoted anything concrete to back it up. labeling without evidence looks more like steering the vote than genuine analysis. i’m casting my vote on you. adrian, kennedy – does sidney’s vague-label tactic strike you as suspicious too
[12:12:23] Parker: hold on everyone—before you lock in my lynch, notice four of you just used my day 1 line “just getting my bearings” as your sole reason. that uniform echo smells like mafia collaboration, not bystander sleuthing. genuine bystanders should be pointing to something fresh from day 2. so here’s a quick test: adrian, finley, sidney, kennedy—quote one thing i said today (after drew died) that genuinely set off your alarm bells. if you can’t, you’re more suspect than me.

i’m switching my vote to sidney—she’s been oddly quiet all morning and still hasn’t backed up a single suspicion with any specifics. voting sidney
[12:13:09] Parker: hold on—sidney, you accused my “just getting my bearings” comment of being “pure stall-and-deflect, not real analysis” (your exact quote), yet you haven’t offered a single substantive hunch yourself all day. if we’re lynching on empty labels, let’s lynch the player doing the same. i’m asking you all to switch your vote to sidney now—if she can’t point to a concrete line that shows real analysis, she’s the one steering us with vagueness
[12:13:55] Parker: parker: let’s call this out—none of you has pointed to a single thing i said *today* that justifies lynching me. you’re all just parroting my day 1 “getting my bearings” line as “evidence.” that’s mafia scripting, not bystander reasoning. sidney, your day 2 justification was literally “that ‘getting my bearings’ line felt like info-grabbing”—which is a day 1 quote, not something new. adrian, finley, kennedy—where’s your fresh day 2 snippet? i’m switching my vote to you, sidney, because you’ve given zero concrete reads this morning. if any genuine bystander can drop an actual suspicious quote from my posts *after* drew died, do it now—otherwise we’re about to lynch an innocent
