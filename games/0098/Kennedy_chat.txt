[12:04:07] Kennedy: hey everyone! kennedy here. excited for day 1. since we haven’t had a night yet, we’re starting blind—no kills or hints so far. how’s everyone feeling about our first vote? would you rather wait for more info or throw out a gut hunch now? i don’t have any strong suspicions yet, but i’ll be watching for anyone pushing too hard to steer the convo. who wants to kick things off with their initial read
[12:04:25] Kennedy: hey y’all—it feels like we’re zeroing in on parker mainly because they’re quiet, but that’s maybe too easy. we’ve got a few minutes before voting, so can we grab some specifics? tyler, what exactly struck you about sidney? sidney, what about parker’s quiet made you suspicious? parker, you asked adrian and me for thoughts—what made you pick on us? let’s get concrete reads before we commit a vote
[12:05:00] Kennedy: hey everyone, thanks for all the reads so far. my one gut pick is sidney—they’ve been sticking to generic deflections without offering any concrete observations, even when pressed. sidney, can you point to something specific in parker’s wording or anyone else’s behaviour that set off your alarm bells? i’d feel a lot better locking in a vote if there’s a solid detail behind it
[12:05:33] Kennedy: kennedy: parker, nice catch—tyler’s repeated use of “deflecting” and “extreme neutrality” really is pretty broad. tyler, can you point us to the exact wording or timing that struck you, and—if you have one—name a second suspect besides the quieter players? sidney, drew, finley: if you each had to lock in a gut hunch right now, who would it be and what concrete phrasing or behavior made you uneasy? let’s get a few more data points before we cast any votes
[12:06:18] Kennedy: alright, one name, one line from me: i’m leaning on drew—he’s been all about mining our exact quotes but hasn’t offered a solid read of his own, which feels like info‐gathering more than genuine bystander play. anyone else catching that vibe
[12:06:38] Kennedy: kennedy: i’m leaning hard toward tyler here. his very first post said “parker jumped in awfully fast… maybe deflecting?” and later he called parker’s “extreme neutrality” suspicious—both with zero concrete follow-up. that pattern of vague steering feels more telling than parker’s irl delay. i’m about to vote tyler unless someone can point me to a single specific line from parker (or anyone else) that really stuck out. any last-second concrete quote to flip me
[12:11:02] Kennedy: kennedy: now that we lost two bystanders after heavy steering, let’s learn from it. on day 1 the loudest voices turned out clean, yet we all got dragged by vague labels. today i want to spotlight players who’ve been neutral or deflecting. parker’s silence until a last-minute pivot feels textbook info-gathering, and sidney’s been frustratingly vague when pressed. meanwhile, finley and adrian gave us solid quotes to work with. who else saw specific lines from parker or sidney that set off alarm bells? let’s dig into those before we pick
[12:11:31] Kennedy: kennedy: one name, one line — parker: “i’m pretty neutral right now, but i’m curious to hear from adrian or sidney.” that reads like classic info-gathering, not a genuine gut hunch. i’m voting parker
[12:12:16] Kennedy: kennedy: parker – “i’m pretty neutral right now, but i’m curious to hear from adrian or sidney” read like an info-gathering stall rather than a genuine hunch; voting parker
[12:13:01] Kennedy: kennedy: here’s mine—parker’s own words: “that uniform echo smells like mafia collaboration, not bystander sleuthing.” that broad, evidence-free accusation felt like a classic deflection play instead of a real read. i’m sticking with my vote on parker unless someone can point to an actual suspicious snippet from her day-2 posts
[12:13:39] Kennedy: kennedy: sure—here’s something you said today after drew died: “my one-line hunch: sidney—she’s slipped back into radio silence even after the kill.” that felt like a vague pivot, not real evidence. i’m locking my vote on parker
