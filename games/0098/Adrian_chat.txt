[12:04:02] Adrian: hey everyone, adrian here! let’s get the discussion rolling for day 1. we’ve got a few minutes before voting starts—any gut feelings yet or anything seem off to you? i’m going to hang back until we get some real chatter. who wants to share their first impressions
[12:04:20] Adrian: adrian: hey everyone—adrian jumping in. we’ve all noted parker’s near-silence so far, and i’m also curious why kennedy hasn’t said a word yet. early game, but total crickets from two people feels off. rather than a blind vote, how about we each post one suspect plus a quick reason? i’ll kick us off: parker—hasn’t responded despite multiple calls for input. your turn: give us your one pick and why (and parker/kennedy, we’d really love to hear from you too
[12:04:36] Adrian: hey everyone, adrian here—i want to zero in on something concrete before we vote. parker, you prompted us to each share a suspect but haven’t named anyone yourself. that feels like probing for info without committing. what’s your gut pick right now? shrugging it off could be bystander caution, or it could be mafia gathering intel. sidney and finley, you’ve both flagged parker—can you point to any specific wording or timing in their messages that felt off? let’s move beyond vibes and get some actual details to work with
[12:04:50] Adrian: adrian: alright, here’s my two cents—parker’s near-silence even after direct prompts feels odd, and tyler’s hyper-active push for quick gut hunches makes me wonder if they’re trying to herd us into a snap vote. that’s where i land so far. kennedy, you’ve been watching for steering—who sticks out to you right now? drew, finley, any thoughts on parker vs. tyler
[12:06:37] Adrian: alright, let’s do the one-name/one-quote round and then vote. mine: tyler – “maybe deflecting?” from his very first post, with zero concrete follow-up. i’m casting my vote for tyler. kennedy, sidney, finley, drew—drop your one-liner pick + the exact snippet that tipped you off, and let’s wrap this up
[12:07:13] Adrian: adrian: i’m casting my vote on tyler – his repeated use of “maybe deflecting” and “extreme neutrality” to label quieter players without citing any specifics feels like a classic steering tactic. if anyone else is undecided, please vote now so we can lock this in
[12:10:59] Adrian: morning everyone—tough loss losing drew last night. let’s kick off day 2 with a quick “one name, one quote/behavior” round in alphabetical order so we can spot any overlaps. finley you’re up first, then kennedy, parker, sidney, and i’ll wrap up.  

finley—who sticks out to you right now and what exact line or action of theirs made you pause?
[12:11:21] Adrian: adrian: one name, one line—parker. in her very first post today she wrote “i’m pretty neutral right now, but i’m curious to hear from adrian or sidney,” then barely said a word until voting time. that felt like pure stall-and-deflect instead of offering a real hunch. i’m locking in my vote on parker
[12:11:42] Adrian: adrian: one name, one line – parker: “i’m pretty neutral right now, but i’m curious to hear from adrian or sidney.” feels like pure info-gathering, not a real read. i’m locking in my vote on parker. anyone else voting differently
[12:12:49] Adrian: adrian: one name, one line — parker: in her very first post she wrote “i’m pretty neutral right now, but i’m curious to hear from adrian or sidney,” which is pure stall/info-gathering with zero real analysis. i’m locking in my vote on parker—let’s finish this
