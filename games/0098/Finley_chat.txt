[12:04:00] Finley: hey everyone, finley here! it’s day 1 and i haven’t really sensed a strong suspect yet. what are everyone’s gut reads? parker, drew, tyler—you’ve all been pretty quiet so far, what are you thinking? anyone else picking up on something odd? let’s get some thoughts before voting
[12:04:15] Finley: finley here—totally agree that day 1 vibes are weird. parker’s eagerness does feel a bit too much, too fast, but sidney’s radio silence could be just as telling (either super confident or hiding something). i’m not ready to lock onto one person yet. adrian, drew—what are you both picking up? anyone catch an odd phrasing or a hesitation that stood out? maybe let’s each name one suspect and a quick reason before we rush to a vote
[12:04:34] Finley: parker, you’ve been the focal point so far—could you share any gut read on someone else so we’re not just piling on low activity? and tyler, you’ve been pretty active steering us toward parker—what makes them stand out more than, say, adrian or kennedy? drew, adrian, kennedy—any alternative suspects or thoughts? let’s get at least two names on the table before we lock in a vote
[12:05:10] Finley: finley here—before we start casting votes, how about a quick “one name, one line” round? everyone drops exactly one suspect and a sentence why, then we tally.  

parker—you’d flagged tyler and sidney before, but pick the one you feel stronger about.  
kennedy—we’ve barely heard a hunch from you yet, so curious who you land on.  
as for me, i’m still eyeing parker’s very cautious “getting my bearings” move—it feels more defensive than thoughtful.  

let’s get those picks in the next minute so we can see if anyone else is consistently popping up
[12:05:59] Finley: hey all—i’m really torn between parker and tyler, but right now tyler’s approach feels more suspect to me. parker at least just explained their irl distraction and gave a clear gut read on tyler. tyler, you’ve twice labelled quietness as “deflection” but haven’t pointed to a single phrase or moment in parker’s (or anyone’s) posts that stood out. can you show us exactly what wording made you think parker was deflecting? if it’s just “they were quiet,” i’m ready to shift my vote to you. who else sees tyler’s vague steering as more suspicious than parker’s late reply
[12:06:32] Finley: finley: i’m voting tyler. he threw out “maybe deflecting?” and flagged parker’s “extreme neutrality” without any concrete examples, all while rushing us into gut hunches. that feels like classic misdirection. voting tyler—anyone else locking him in
[12:07:10] Finley: finley: one name, one line—tyler: his very first jab at parker, “maybe deflecting?”, came with zero concrete reason or quote. i’m locking in my vote for tyler now. anyone planning to switch or speak up before we finalize
[12:08:09] Finley: sidney, i’m leaning hard toward taking out drew tonight. he’s the one drilling us for exact quotes and pushing evidence—he’s our biggest risk. parker and adrian are quieter and easier to redirect suspicion onto tomorrow. let me know if you agree, and we’ll lock in drew
[12:08:29] Finley: sidney, we’ve got adrian, drew, parker and kennedy as options. i’m leaning toward parker—she’s been our biggest info-gatherer (all those “getting my bearings” and last-second flips on us) and flagged us both early. taking her out removes a loud probe and looks consistent with day 1 momentum. kennedy did call you out by name, but parker feels like the real threat. what do you think—parker tonight, or would you rather off kennedy
[12:08:43] Finley: i’m locking in drew as our kill tonight. let’s take him out
[12:09:27] Finley: got it—drew is locked in as our kill tonight. that’ll shut down his quote-mining. tomorrow we can shift heat back onto parker
[12:10:45] Finley: finley: morning everyone. losing drew was rough—he was our best quote-miner and the mafia knew it, so they took him out. now we need to refocus. i’m still eyeing parker: she’s hovered in the margins, only spoke up when cornered, and her “just getting my bearings” line feels like a classic dodge. i’m voting parker today. adrian, kennedy—what’s your one pick and the exact line that raised an eyebrow for you? let’s each drop one name + one concrete snippet, then lock this in before the mafia strikes again
[12:11:07] Finley: wow, tough start losing drew last night—he was our best at sniffing out those vague steering plays. now that we’re back at day, i’m still stuck on parker: she went radio-silent for most of day 1, then suddenly jumped in at the last second to point at tyler, and has barely offered any real reads of her own. that flip-flop feels more like info-gathering than genuine suspicion. adrian, kennedy—do you see that same pattern in her posts, or is someone else standing out to you right now
[12:11:30] Finley: finley: parker – in her first post she said “sorry for the quiet start, just getting my bearings,” which reads like a stall/info-gathering move, not genuine analysis. i’m voting parker. adrian, kennedy—your one-liner picks + exact snippets
[12:12:58] Finley: finley: sure—here’s something you said today after drew died: “i’m switching my vote to sidney—she’s been oddly quiet all morning and still hasn’t backed up a single suspicion with any specifics.” that’s exactly the kind of vague, quote-free accusation you’ve been calling out others for, rather than offering any concrete reads of your own. i’m sticking my vote on parker—your pattern of broad deflection and last-second flips makes you far more suspicious than sidney
[12:13:30] Finley: parker, you did actually give a day 2 quote—“my one-line hunch: sidney — she’s slipped back into radio silence even after the kill.” that ticks your own “something i said today” box, so your test isn’t holding up. and frankly, accusing sidney of “radio silence” is just as vague as your earlier stall tactics. this last-second pivot screams panic deflection, not genuine sleuthing. i’m sticking with parker—anyone else have a fresh, concrete snippet from parker today that actually raises an eyebrow? if not, let’s lock this in
