[12:03:59] Tyler: hey all, tyler here. day 1’s always rough since info is slim—let’s pool our gut feelings. for me, sidney’s been pretty quiet and parker jumped in awfully fast… maybe deflecting? who’s standing out to you so far
[12:04:08] Tyler: hey everyone, tyler here! since it’s day 1 and we’ve got zero hard info, how about a quick round of initial reads? maybe each of us names one person who feels a bit off or quiet. for me, parker’s super low-key so far—could be shy or trying to hide. how about the rest of you
[12:04:31] Tyler: okay, i’m going to throw out parker as my gut hunch—their extreme neutrality and quietness is standing out. parker, what’s behind that “just curious” stance? and everyone else, pick one name you’re feeling most suspicious of right now so we can see if any patterns emerge
[12:05:11] Tyler: sure—here’s why parker jumps out more than adrian or kennedy. parker’s been almost mute until now, then chimed in with non-specific “curiosity,” which feels like stalling. meanwhile, kennedy’s also been quiet and quick to nit-pick our reads instead of offering one of their own. adrian at least has given a consistent perspective. so my top two are parker and then kennedy.  
parker: what’s your concrete read on someone else?  
kennedy: who are you actually leaning toward and why?
[12:05:35] Tyler: i’ll go with parker – when we first asked for a read, parker said “i’m pretty neutral right now, but i’m curious to hear from adrian or sidney.” after multiple prompts that felt like a dodge/info-grab rather than a real hunch
[12:06:06] Tyler: alright, i’ll go first: i’m throwing my vote toward parker. the exact snippet that jumped out at me was “sorry for the quiet start, just getting my bearings” when they’d already been asked twice for a gut read—that felt evasive under pressure. 

sidney, kennedy, finley, adrian, drew — let’s each name one suspect and quote the precise line or timing that tipped you off. that way we’ve got real data before we lock in our vote
[12:06:44] Tyler: hey everyone, before these votes lock in i want to challenge the narrative on parker. in their very first post they said “i’m pretty neutral right now, but i’m curious to hear from adrian or sidney”—that feels like classic info-gathering, not a genuine hunch. they then sat silent until the last second before flipping to accuse me, without ever offering a single concrete observation of their own. meanwhile all i did was suggest a quick round of gut reads so we’d have something to go on. if anyone can point out a specific line of mine that really amounts to “deflection” beyond “they were quiet,” please share it. otherwise i’m switching my vote to parker—who’s with me
