[12:04:02] Drew: hey everyone, drew here! since it’s day 1 we don’t have much to go on yet… did anyone catch anything odd during last night’s silence? i’ve noticed parker’s been super quiet—could just be a strategy, but could also be laying low. what do you all think? anyone else getting a gut feeling about someone already
[12:04:16] Drew: hey tyler, finley—drew here! day 1’s always murky. parker’s eagerness to point fingers stood out, but sidney’s radio silence feels just as telling. i’m not ready to pull the trigger yet—how about we hear quick gut reads from adrian and kennedy before anyone votes? that might help us zero in rather than rushing a lynch
[12:04:36] Drew: i’m going to put parker on my radar today. parker, you’ve asked everyone to share their gut reads but haven’t given your own pick yet—that feels more like deflection than real engagement. who are *you* leaning toward and what stood out? and tyler, you’ve flagged parker twice now—can you point to the exact phrasing or moment that made you suspicious? let’s get some concrete reasons on the table before we vote
[12:05:11] Drew: drew: hey everyone—before we rush into a lynch, can we get some concrete quotes? parker, you’ve now flagged tyler, sidney, and kennedy—could you point to the exact line or word in each message that felt off? for instance, tyler’s “maybe deflecting?” felt like an early steering attempt without any backup. and tyler, you’re bent on parker—what exact phrasing from parker stuck out to you? let’s each drop one suspect plus the specific snippet that raised an eyebrow so we have real reasons to vote, not just gut vibes. thoughts
[12:05:35] Drew: drew: i’m naming tyler – his eagerness to rush gut hunches and herd suspicion toward quieter players without solid reasons feels like a deflection play
[12:06:01] Drew: drew: i’m locking in tyler for now. in your very first post you said “parker jumped in awfully fast… maybe deflecting?” with zero follow-up, then later accused kennedy of being “quick to nit-pick” again without quoting anything concrete. that pattern of vague labels and no substance feels like steering. finley, sidney—who are you each leaning toward right now, and what exact phrasing or action made you uneasy
[12:06:41] Drew: i’m still with finley on this: tyler, you’ve accused parker of “deflecting” and “extreme neutrality” twice now, but you haven’t pointed to a single line where she actually did anything suspicious beyond being quiet or saying she was “getting her bearings.” that’s really vague. parker at least gave a clear reason for her hunch. tyler, can you quote the exact wording or moment that set off alarm bells for you? if it’s just her silence, i’m more comfortable keeping my vote on you for steering us into a snap lynch. adrian, sidney, kennedy—what do you make of tyler’s rationale
