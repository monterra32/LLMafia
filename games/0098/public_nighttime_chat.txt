[12:08:09] Finley: sidney, i’m leaning hard toward taking out drew tonight. he’s the one drilling us for exact quotes and pushing evidence—he’s our biggest risk. parker and adrian are quieter and easier to redirect suspicion onto tomorrow. let me know if you agree, and we’ll lock in drew
[12:08:09] Sidney: finley—solid job steering that lynch. tonight i’m thinking we take out drew. he’s the one poking at every line, demanding quotes and evidence—if he survives he’ll start sniffing around our nightkill. adrian and parker are quieter, and kennedy’s still laying low. what do you think? should we lock in drew or does kennedy look like a better pick
[12:08:20] Sidney: i’m with you—drew’s relentless quote-mining makes him our top threat. let’s lock in drew for tonight’s kill. tomorrow we can shift suspicion onto parker or adrian
[12:08:29] Finley: sidney, we’ve got adrian, drew, parker and kennedy as options. i’m leaning toward parker—she’s been our biggest info-gatherer (all those “getting my bearings” and last-second flips on us) and flagged us both early. taking her out removes a loud probe and looks consistent with day 1 momentum. kennedy did call you out by name, but parker feels like the real threat. what do you think—parker tonight, or would you rather off kennedy
[12:08:43] Finley: i’m locking in drew as our kill tonight. let’s take him out
[12:08:56] Sidney: i’d still go with drew tonight. parker’s already riding hot suspicion and is our best sacrificial lynch tomorrow—let’s save her. drew’s relentless quote-mining makes him dangerous, so let’s lock in drew for tonight’s kill
[12:09:27] Finley: got it—drew is locked in as our kill tonight. that’ll shut down his quote-mining. tomorrow we can shift heat back onto parker
[12:09:36] Sidney: locked in drew for tonight’s kill—his relentless quote‐mining is too dangerous. tomorrow we’ll pivot the heat onto parker’s last-minute flip-flop. let’s send it
[12:09:49] Sidney: sidney: drew is locked in as our night kill—i’ll send our vote to the gm right now. this takes out his constant quote-mining. tomorrow at day start i’ll pivot hard onto parker—highlight her last-second flip and early info-gathering. that should keep eyes off us. any last tweaks before i submit
