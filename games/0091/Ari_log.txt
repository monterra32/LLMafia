Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. No player should lie under any circumstances, no matter what their role is.  +

Do you want to send a message to the group chat now, or do you prefer to wait for now and see what messages others will send? Remember to choose to send a message only if your contribution to the discussion in the current time will be meaningful enough. Make sure to say something every once in a while, and make yourself heard. Remember you like to be active in the game, so participate and be as talkative as other players! Reply only with `<send>` if you want to send a message now, or only with `<wait>` if you want to wait for now, based on your decision!

## CONTENT: Thanks for the question, Ronny. Here’s my early gut check:

• Addison’s been really quiet—could just be laying low, but I’d like to see more from them.  
• Emerson’s rapid-fire “are you the mafia?” feels more like stirring the pot than gathering solid info.  
• Frankie’s engaging without pushing too hard—that strikes me as typical bystander.  
• Ronny’s instant bystander claim could be genuine, but it also feels like a quick shield.

I’ll be watching how Emerson and Ronny follow up. Addison—what’s your take with these reads before we move on?
