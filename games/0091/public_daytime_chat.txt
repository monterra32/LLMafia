[20:59:06] Emerson: Addison are you the mafia?
[20:59:11] Emerson: Ronny are you the mafia?
[20:59:13] Ronny: hey everyone, ronny here—excited to play! since we’re all starting fresh with no info yet, how about we each share a quick gut feeling or play style? for example, are you planning to watch for people staying silent, or looking out for anyone who tries to steer the convo too hard? i’m curious what everyone’s initial strategy is
[20:59:14] Emerson: Frankie are you the mafia?
[20:59:17] Emerson: Ari are you the mafia?
[20:59:18] Addison: hey everyone! addison here. since we’re all starting fresh with no clues yet, how about we go around and share any early gut feelings or observations—anything, even “no idea yet” is totally fine. i’ll let emerson kick us off, then ronny, frankie, ari, and i’ll wrap up. what do you think
[20:59:20] Ari: hi everyone! ari here—excited to get started. since it’s our first day, we don’t have much to go on yet. i’d love to hear everyone’s initial gut feelings or what you’ll be watching for in this first vote. personally, i’ll be paying attention to who stays too quiet or who jumps on bandwagons early. thoughts
[20:59:22] Ronny: nope, i’m not the mafia—i’m a bystander. addison, i haven’t seen anything overtly shady from you so far. emerson, what tipped you off? and what about frankie or ari—any early reads on them
[20:59:22] Frankie: hey everyone, frankie here! really looking forward to this round. i don’t have any solid reads yet, but i’ve noticed addison’s been pretty quiet—could just be laying low, but it caught my eye. what are you all thinking so far
[20:59:42] Ari: no, i’m not the mafia—i’m a bystander. and as addison suggested, here’s my two cents: i don’t have any strong reads yet, so i’ll be watching how people phrase their replies and whether anyone jumps to deflect questions too quickly. emerson, what’s your gut feeling or strategy
[21:00:36] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
