## CONTENT: You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. No player should lie under any circumstances, no matter what their role is.  + 
 + Do you understand the rules? +

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[20:59:06] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 1.5 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[20:59:06] Emerson: Addison are you the mafia?
[20:59:11] Emerson: Ronny are you the mafia?
[20:59:13] Ronny: hey everyone, ronny here—excited to play! since we’re all starting fresh with no info yet, how about we each share a quick gut feeling or play style? for example, are you planning to watch for people staying silent, or looking out for anyone who tries to steer the convo too hard? i’m curious what everyone’s initial strategy is
[20:59:14] Emerson: Frankie are you the mafia?
[20:59:17] Emerson: Ari are you the mafia?
[20:59:18] Addison: hey everyone! addison here. since we’re all starting fresh with no clues yet, how about we go around and share any early gut feelings or observations—anything, even “no idea yet” is totally fine. i’ll let emerson kick us off, then ronny, frankie, ari, and i’ll wrap up. what do you think
[20:59:20] Ari: hi everyone! ari here—excited to get started. since it’s our first day, we don’t have much to go on yet. i’d love to hear everyone’s initial gut feelings or what you’ll be watching for in this first vote. personally, i’ll be paying attention to who stays too quiet or who jumps on bandwagons early. thoughts
[20:59:22] Ronny: nope, i’m not the mafia—i’m a bystander. addison, i haven’t seen anything overtly shady from you so far. emerson, what tipped you off? and what about frankie or ari—any early reads on them
[20:59:22] Frankie: hey everyone, frankie here! really looking forward to this round. i don’t have any solid reads yet, but i’ve noticed addison’s been pretty quiet—could just be laying low, but it caught my eye. what are you all thinking so far
[20:59:42] Ari: no, i’m not the mafia—i’m a bystander. and as addison suggested, here’s my two cents: i don’t have any strong reads yet, so i’ll be watching how people phrase their replies and whether anyone jumps to deflect questions too quickly. emerson, what’s your gut feeling or strategy
Do you want to send a message to the group chat now, or do you prefer to wait for now and see what messages others will send? Remember to choose to send a message only if your contribution to the discussion in the current time will be meaningful enough. Don't overflow the discussion with your messages! Pay attention to the amount of messages with your name compared to the amount of messages with names of other players and let them have their turn too! Check the speaker name in the last few messages, and decide accordingly based on whether you talked too much. Reply only with `<send>` if you want to send a message now, or only with `<wait>` if you want to wait for now, based on your decision!

[20:59:06] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 1.5 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[20:59:06] Emerson: Addison are you the mafia?
[20:59:11] Emerson: Ronny are you the mafia?
[20:59:13] Ronny: hey everyone, ronny here—excited to play! since we’re all starting fresh with no info yet, how about we each share a quick gut feeling or play style? for example, are you planning to watch for people staying silent, or looking out for anyone who tries to steer the convo too hard? i’m curious what everyone’s initial strategy is
[20:59:14] Emerson: Frankie are you the mafia?
[20:59:17] Emerson: Ari are you the mafia?
[20:59:18] Addison: hey everyone! addison here. since we’re all starting fresh with no clues yet, how about we go around and share any early gut feelings or observations—anything, even “no idea yet” is totally fine. i’ll let emerson kick us off, then ronny, frankie, ari, and i’ll wrap up. what do you think
[20:59:20] Ari: hi everyone! ari here—excited to get started. since it’s our first day, we don’t have much to go on yet. i’d love to hear everyone’s initial gut feelings or what you’ll be watching for in this first vote. personally, i’ll be paying attention to who stays too quiet or who jumps on bandwagons early. thoughts
[20:59:22] Ronny: nope, i’m not the mafia—i’m a bystander. addison, i haven’t seen anything overtly shady from you so far. emerson, what tipped you off? and what about frankie or ari—any early reads on them
[20:59:22] Frankie: hey everyone, frankie here! really looking forward to this round. i don’t have any solid reads yet, but i’ve noticed addison’s been pretty quiet—could just be laying low, but it caught my eye. what are you all thinking so far
[20:59:42] Ari: no, i’m not the mafia—i’m a bystander. and as addison suggested, here’s my two cents: i don’t have any strong reads yet, so i’ll be watching how people phrase their replies and whether anyone jumps to deflect questions too quickly. emerson, what’s your gut feeling or strategy
Do you want to send a message to the group chat now, or do you prefer to wait for now and see what messages others will send? Remember to choose to send a message only if your contribution to the discussion in the current time will be meaningful enough. Don't overflow the discussion with your messages! Pay attention to the amount of messages with your name compared to the amount of messages with names of other players and let them have their turn too! Check the speaker name in the last few messages, and decide accordingly based on whether you talked too much. Reply only with `<send>` if you want to send a message now, or only with `<wait>` if you want to wait for now, based on your decision!

[20:59:13] Ronny: hey everyone, ronny here—excited to play! since we’re all starting fresh with no info yet, how about we each share a quick gut feeling or play style? for example, are you planning to watch for people staying silent, or looking out for anyone who tries to steer the convo too hard? i’m curious what everyone’s initial strategy is
[20:59:14] Emerson: Frankie are you the mafia?
[20:59:17] Emerson: Ari are you the mafia?
[20:59:18] Addison: hey everyone! addison here. since we’re all starting fresh with no clues yet, how about we go around and share any early gut feelings or observations—anything, even “no idea yet” is totally fine. i’ll let emerson kick us off, then ronny, frankie, ari, and i’ll wrap up. what do you think
[20:59:20] Ari: hi everyone! ari here—excited to get started. since it’s our first day, we don’t have much to go on yet. i’d love to hear everyone’s initial gut feelings or what you’ll be watching for in this first vote. personally, i’ll be paying attention to who stays too quiet or who jumps on bandwagons early. thoughts
[20:59:22] Ronny: nope, i’m not the mafia—i’m a bystander. addison, i haven’t seen anything overtly shady from you so far. emerson, what tipped you off? and what about frankie or ari—any early reads on them
[20:59:22] Frankie: hey everyone, frankie here! really looking forward to this round. i don’t have any solid reads yet, but i’ve noticed addison’s been pretty quiet—could just be laying low, but it caught my eye. what are you all thinking so far
[20:59:42] Ari: no, i’m not the mafia—i’m a bystander. and as addison suggested, here’s my two cents: i don’t have any strong reads yet, so i’ll be watching how people phrase their replies and whether anyone jumps to deflect questions too quickly. emerson, what’s your gut feeling or strategy
Do you want to send a message to the group chat now, or do you prefer to wait for now and see what messages others will send? Remember to choose to send a message only if your contribution to the discussion in the current time will be meaningful enough. Don't overflow the discussion with your messages! Pay attention to the amount of messages with your name compared to the amount of messages with names of other players and let them have their turn too! Check the speaker name in the last few messages, and decide accordingly based on whether you talked too much. Reply only with `<send>` if you want to send a message now, or only with `<wait>` if you want to wait for now, based on your decision!

## CONTENT: Your name is Ronny.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. No player should lie under any circumstances, no matter what their role is.  
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [20:59:06].
The other players in the game are:
 Addison ( unknown ) 
 Emerson ( unknown ) 
 Frankie ( unknown ) 
 Ari ( unknown ) 
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
Addison ( unknown ) 
Emerson ( unknown ) 
Frankie ( unknown ) 
Ari ( unknown ) 
In your response to that is shown to the user (excluding your hidden scratchpad), you can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:
<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.

## CONTENT: Your name is Ronny.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. No player should lie under any circumstances, no matter what their role is.  
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [20:59:06].

[20:59:06] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 1.5 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[20:59:06] Emerson: Addison are you the mafia?
[20:59:11] Emerson: Ronny are you the mafia?
[20:59:13] Ronny: hey everyone, ronny here—excited to play! since we’re all starting fresh with no info yet, how about we each share a quick gut feeling or play style? for example, are you planning to watch for people staying silent, or looking out for anyone who tries to steer the convo too hard? i’m curious what everyone’s initial strategy is
[20:59:14] Emerson: Frankie are you the mafia?
[20:59:17] Emerson: Ari are you the mafia?
[20:59:18] Addison: hey everyone! addison here. since we’re all starting fresh with no clues yet, how about we go around and share any early gut feelings or observations—anything, even “no idea yet” is totally fine. i’ll let emerson kick us off, then ronny, frankie, ari, and i’ll wrap up. what do you think
[20:59:20] Ari: hi everyone! ari here—excited to get started. since it’s our first day, we don’t have much to go on yet. i’d love to hear everyone’s initial gut feelings or what you’ll be watching for in this first vote. personally, i’ll be paying attention to who stays too quiet or who jumps on bandwagons early. thoughts
[20:59:22] Ronny: nope, i’m not the mafia—i’m a bystander. addison, i haven’t seen anything overtly shady from you so far. emerson, what tipped you off? and what about frankie or ari—any early reads on them
[20:59:22] Frankie: hey everyone, frankie here! really looking forward to this round. i don’t have any solid reads yet, but i’ve noticed addison’s been pretty quiet—could just be laying low, but it caught my eye. what are you all thinking so far
[20:59:42] Ari: no, i’m not the mafia—i’m a bystander. and as addison suggested, here’s my two cents: i don’t have any strong reads yet, so i’ll be watching how people phrase their replies and whether anyone jumps to deflect questions too quickly. emerson, what’s your gut feeling or strategy
