## CONTENT: You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  + 
 + Do you understand the rules? +

The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  
You were assigned the following role: bystander.

[16:40:15] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[16:40:27] Dakota: hey everyone, i’m excited to get started! since no one’s spoken yet, why don’t we each share any first impressions or gut feelings? i don’t have a strong read yet, but i’m watching for who seems unusually quiet or eager. i’ll go first—so far i’ve noticed parker hasn’t said much. what about the rest of you
[16:40:29] Kennedy: hey everyone! happy day 1—hope you’re all ready for some fun detective work. i haven’t spotted anything too fishy yet, but i’m curious: have any of you gotten a weird vibe from someone? i’m watching who’s laying low versus who’s racing to make accusations. what are your initial reads
[16:40:29] Ray: hey everyone, ray here! excited for day 1—i’m curious, do you usually watch for people who lead the charge right away versus those who hang back? what’s everyone’s gut feeling on where to start

[16:40:29] Ray: hey everyone, ray here! excited for day 1—i’m curious, do you usually watch for people who lead the charge right away versus those who hang back? what’s everyone’s gut feeling on where to start
[16:40:39] Parker: hey everyone, we’ve got 2 minutes—how about a quick round-robin? ray, sam, kennedy, dakota, share one gut-read on who seems most suspicious right now, then i’ll give mine. ray, you’re up first
[16:40:39] Sam: hey everyone—sam here! day 1 and we’ve got no solid leads yet, so how about a quick, non-binding straw poll? just vote for whoever you’re least excited about and we’ll see if any names bubble up. if that feels too random, we can also go around with one hot take each. thoughts
[16:40:42] Kennedy: hey everyone! i’m kennedy—nice to meet you all. i agree with dakota that parker’s been awfully quiet, but i also noticed sam hasn’t said much either. ray jumped in right away, which could be genuine eagerness or a way to steer our attention. i don’t want to single someone out too fast, so i’d love to hear more from sam and parker. what are you both thinking so far
[16:40:43] Dakota: hey everyone, happy day 1! since we’re all starting with zero info, let’s do a quick round of first impressions before casting any votes. ray, parker, sam, kennedy—what’s one thing that’s stood out to you so far in people’s tone or timing? i figure anyone who jumps in before we even get a question might be trying to set the pace, but total silence could be hiding something too. no rush to vote yet, just looking to get a feel for who might be over-eager or unusually quiet. what do you all think
[16:40:48] Ray: hey everyone, ray here—happy day 1! i’m with dakota on noticing quiet players, so parker’s radio silence catches my eye. on the other hand, sam’s energy is off the charts—sometimes that’s just enthusiasm, other times it’s a smokescreen. what do you all make of it? kennedy, you mentioned watching who’s “racing to make accusations” yesterday—how does sam look from your side? and sam, any thoughts on parker playing it cool? let’s pool our initial reads before we start voting
