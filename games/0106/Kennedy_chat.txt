[16:40:29] Kennedy: hey everyone! happy day 1—hope you’re all ready for some fun detective work. i haven’t spotted anything too fishy yet, but i’m curious: have any of you gotten a weird vibe from someone? i’m watching who’s laying low versus who’s racing to make accusations. what are your initial reads
[16:40:42] Kennedy: hey everyone! i’m kennedy—nice to meet you all. i agree with dakota that parker’s been awfully quiet, but i also noticed sam hasn’t said much either. ray jumped in right away, which could be genuine eagerness or a way to steer our attention. i don’t want to single someone out too fast, so i’d love to hear more from sam and parker. what are you both thinking so far
