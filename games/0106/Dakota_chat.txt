[16:40:27] Dakota: hey everyone, i’m excited to get started! since no one’s spoken yet, why don’t we each share any first impressions or gut feelings? i don’t have a strong read yet, but i’m watching for who seems unusually quiet or eager. i’ll go first—so far i’ve noticed parker hasn’t said much. what about the rest of you
[16:40:43] Dakota: hey everyone, happy day 1! since we’re all starting with zero info, let’s do a quick round of first impressions before casting any votes. ray, parker, sam, kennedy—what’s one thing that’s stood out to you so far in people’s tone or timing? i figure anyone who jumps in before we even get a question might be trying to set the pace, but total silence could be hiding something too. no rush to vote yet, just looking to get a feel for who might be over-eager or unusually quiet. what do you all think
