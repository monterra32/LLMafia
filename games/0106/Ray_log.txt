The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  +

Do you want to send a message to the group chat now, or do you prefer to wait for now and see what messages others will send? Remember to choose to send a message only if your contribution to the discussion in the current time will be meaningful enough. Make sure to say something every once in a while, and make yourself heard. Remember you like to be active in the game, so participate and be as talkative as other players! Reply only with `<send>` if you want to send a message now, or only with `<wait>` if you want to wait for now, based on your decision!
