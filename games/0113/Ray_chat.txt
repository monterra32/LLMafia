[16:31:36] Ray: hey everyone! ray here. since we’ve got two minutes and no one’s been booted yet, we’re basically flying blind—so i say we go around and share any odd vibes we’ve picked up so far. i haven’t seen any glaring red flags yet, but i did notice parker’s been pretty quiet. could just be nerves, though. sam, what’s your take? kennedy, dakota—how are you both feeling about the table right now
[16:31:58] Ray: ray: hey everyone, ray here! day 1 is always tricky with no hard info, so i’m focusing on how folks react once a name’s on the table—people often overdefend or shy away. parker, you were quick to single out kennedy, which could be nerves or projection. kennedy, i like your plan to watch voting patterns. sam and dakota, what are your early impressions? your insights could really tip things for me
[16:32:24] Ray: alright everyone, to cut through the vibes let’s try a quick lightning round: each of us names one person we find suspicious and gives one specific example. i’ll start: i’m suspicious of parker because when asked for details they’ve been super vague and keep circling back to quietness = guilt. sam, kennedy, dakota—your turn
[16:32:41] Ray: i’ll go:  
• trust: kennedy – her measured, voting‐pattern focus feels solid.  
• suspicious: parker – they’ve been quick to single out the quiet players with almost no read.  

sam, do you see it the same way before we lock in our picks?
[16:33:00] Ray: ray: trust kennedy—she’s been measured and hasn’t tried to steer us. suspicious parker—keeps circling back to “quiet” without offering a single concrete reason or plan. i’m locking my vote on parker. who else is with me
[16:35:19] Ray: hey sam, dakota—tough loss with kennedy. we’re down to three and one of us has to be mafia, so let’s figure it out. i honestly don’t have enough to pick one of you out yet, so i’m going to hold my vote this round. sam, who are you leaning toward and what’s your read? dakota, same question for you. let’s see how you two break before i decide
[16:35:50] Ray: sam, help me understand your play here: you were kennedy’s biggest defender all day, yet as soon as parker went down you barely objected to kennedy’s night kill. if you were a bystander you’d be fuming and demanding answers—so why the radio silence? and before that, you locked in on parker almost immediately after a single “quiet=mafia” jab, which feels like setting up a clean lynch for your team. unless you can clearly explain both why you pushed parker so hard and why you let kennedy go without protest, i’m leaning toward voting you today. dakota—does any of that line up for you, or am i reading it wrong
