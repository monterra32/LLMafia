[16:31:33] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! since day 1’s our only free-for-all chat, let’s gather any initial gut-feelings before we vote. i’ve noticed kennedy’s been pretty quiet so far—could just be shy, but it also feels a little low-key for day 1. what are you all picking up on? any suspicions or strange vibes so far
[16:31:47] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! first day jitters, right? i’ve noticed kennedy’s been pretty quiet so far—could just be sizing everyone up, or maybe a low‐key mafia tactic. what’s everyone else’s gut feeling so far
[16:32:12] Parker: hey everyone! jumping in on sam’s idea:  
- trust: sam—you’ve been active and balanced without trying to steer too hard  
- suspicious: ray—calling me out early feels a bit like deflection  

kennedy’s quiet might just be cautious, and dakota’s energy seems genuine. what do you all think? any other gut reads before we zero in on someone?
[16:33:06] Parker: hey kennedy—when i called out your quietness, i meant you’ve mostly played mediator so far: asking others for their reads but not really sharing any concrete suspicions or gut calls until just now. that kind of low‐risk approach can let someone fly under the radar, which is a classic mafia move.  

for my picks:  
• trust: sam—you’ve been specific, thoughtful, and haven’t just hopped on a bandwagon.  
• suspicious: ray—you’ve kept pushing the narrative that i’m vague without giving much in return about who you actually think is sus.  

sam, dakota—do those reads jive with you? who are you both leaning toward as we head into the vote?
