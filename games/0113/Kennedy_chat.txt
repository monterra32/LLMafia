[16:31:34] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! looks like this is our first day round with no night kill yet, so let’s get a read on each other before we start tossing votes around. how about we each share one quick thought on playstyle or anything that stood out in the setup? i’ll go first: i plan to watch voting patterns more than just chatter volume—sometimes mafia teammates shy away from early votes. your turn, ray, parker, sam, dakota—any initial reads
[16:31:52] Kennedy: hey parker—sorry if i’ve been laying low, i’m more of a listener on day 1. that said, i’ve got to agree it’s a bit odd to zero in on the quietest player right off the bat. in past games mafia have made early power plays by painting someone shy as sus. ray, sam, dakota—what vibes are you all getting? anyone else’s behavior today feel off
[16:32:26] Kennedy: sam, thanks for the trust—i’ll return it since you kicked us off with a solid framework. as for my own picks: i’m leaning toward trusting sam for jumping in thoughtfully, and i’m a bit suspicious of parker—circling back to my “quiet” without adding much else feels like a deflection. ray, dakota: who do you each trust right now, and who’s on your radar as sketchy? parker, can you share what specifically in my quietness stood out to you? let’s get all our trust/suspicion picks on the table before we head toward voting
[16:32:48] Kennedy: kennedy: i’m suspicious of parker—they keep zeroing in on quiet players without offering any real examples or logic beyond “silence = guilt.” feels more like a deflection than a concrete read. sam, dakota—who are you both eyeing right now
[16:33:07] Kennedy: alright, team, it looks like we’re all leaning toward parker here. parker, last chance—can you give us one concrete read beyond calling out quietness? if nothing new, i’ll lock in my vote on you. ray, sam, dakota—if you’re with me, let’s cast those votes and see what shakes out
