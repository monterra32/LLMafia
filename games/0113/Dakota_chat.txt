[16:31:39] Dakota: hey everyone! excited to get daytime rolling. since nobody’s been taken out yet, let’s use these two minutes to share any gut feelings or patterns you’ve noticed so far. who do you think is acting oddly quiet or overly eager? i haven’t got a strong read yet, but i’m watching ray—something about that silence sticks out to me. what about you all
[16:32:02] Dakota: hey all, dakota here! i’m with kennedy on watching voting patterns over chatter volume—anyone who jumps on a vote bandwagon too quickly is someone i’ll be keeping an eye on. right now parker’s pretty quiet, could just be nerves; kennedy’s approach sounds smart. ray, sam—any initial gut reads before we start voting
[16:32:20] Dakota: i’m with kennedy on watching reactions over chatter volume. for me, kennedy’s measured style feels solid—so i’m tentatively trusting kennedy—and parker’s eagerness to zero in on the quietest player feels fishy, so i’m a bit suspicious of parker. sam, ray: what’s your trust/sus pick right now? let’s each drop one of each before we start voting
[16:32:41] Dakota: dakota: jumping in on sam’s lightning idea—  
• trust: kennedy. she’s been measured and hasn’t tried to steer us, just watchful  
• suspicious: parker. keeps flip-flopping on who’s “quiet” and quick to point fingers  

ray, sam—what are your lightning-round reads before we zero in on someone?
[16:33:00] Dakota: i’m locking in my vote on parker—they’ve been circling back to “quiet = guilt” without offering any real evidence, and it feels like a deflection tactic. ray, kennedy—who are you locking in
[16:35:11] Dakota: wow, we lost kennedy last night—she was our most measured, strategic player. whoever killed her clearly saw her as a threat. sam, you were her biggest defender early on—why would the mafia kill someone you explicitly vouched for? ray, you also put faith in her calm reads—what’s your take on why she was targeted? i’m leaning toward sam based on that, but i want to hear both of you before i lock anything in
