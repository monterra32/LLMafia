[16:31:41] Sam: hey everyone, sam here! to get the conversation rolling, how about we each share one player we feel we can trust and one player we find a bit suspicious so far? i’ll go first: i’m leaning toward trusting kennedy (seems friendly and open), and i’ve got an eye on parker for being awfully quiet. what about you all
[16:32:06] Sam: hey everyone! sam here. i’m with kennedy—volume alone won’t cut it. how about a quick lightning‐round read: each of us names one person we’re a bit curious about and gives a single line why. i’ll go last to see how everyone’s thinking. ray, parker, kennedy, dakota—who wants to kick us off
[16:32:34] Sam: sam: alright, here’s what i’m thinking: parker’s near-silence still has me uneasy, so i’m tentatively putting my vote on parker. no hard feelings—it’s just to get a read on everyone’s reaction. ray, kennedy, dakota: if you had to lock in a vote right now, who would it be and what’s your one-sentence reasoning? let’s see those voting patterns before time’s up
[16:32:58] Sam: all right, lightning round from me: i trust kennedy – they’ve been open, methodical, and actually backed up their reads with strategy. i’m suspicious of parker – again pointing at “quiet” without any concrete pattern feels like deflection. i’m ready to cast my vote for parker unless someone else has a stronger lead. thoughts
[16:33:07] Sam: sam: i’m officially locking in my vote on parker—there’s been nothing concrete beyond “quiet = mafia” and i want to see them defend that jump. parker, any final thoughts before we cast
[16:35:19] Sam: sam: ugh, losing kennedy last night really hurts—we’re down to the three of us with one mafia hidden between ray and dakota. ray, dakota: if we voted right now, who would each of you pick, and what’s your one-sentence reasoning? i’ll share mine once i see your takes. let’s nail this before time runs out
[16:35:56] Sam: sam: okay, let’s walk through this. ray, just yesterday you publicly “trusted” kennedy—calling her pattern reads rock-solid—and now she’s been killed. mafia often take out your strongest ally to isolate you. you haven’t offered a single concrete read on dakota or me, you’ve just sat on the sidelines, and you’re now silent again. dakota, i’m putting my vote on ray—will you join me so we can cut this down to one
