[17:36:58] Kennedy: hey everyone! we’ve got about two minutes, so how about a quick round-robin where each of us names one player we find a bit suspicious (and why)? if we go in order—ray, parker, sam, dakota, then me—it should keep things moving. i’ll kick us off once we’re ready. thoughts
[17:37:21] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here. for my gut pick, i’m feeling a bit uneasy about ray. you jumped straight into a detailed round-robin plan before hearing much else—seems like you’re steering the convo early. could be helpful, but it also feels like a way to shape opinions before we get real info. totally open to being wrong—what do you all think
[17:37:48] Kennedy: hey everyone, thanks for the prompt, parker. my gut is on sam—first they barely said a word, then jumped in quick to critique others’ energy, which feels like overcompensation. i’m not locking in a vote yet, just putting that name out there. dakota, you also flagged sam—what about their silence jumped out at you
[17:38:13] Kennedy: looks like sam and ray are tied in suspicion so far. i’m still uneasy about ray’s early steering of our convo—if we need to vote now i’d be comfortable casting for ray. but sam’s low profile is also fishy. what’s everyone else thinking? let’s each say quickly: ray or sam
