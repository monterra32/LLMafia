[17:36:58] Sam: hey everyone, sam here. since we’ve got a full two minutes, how about we each toss out one quick gut feeling? i’ll go first: parker’s been pretty quiet so far, which could be nerves—but could also be strategic. what about you all? ray, kennedy, dakota—who feels a bit off to you, even if it’s just a tiny vibe
[17:37:24] Sam: hey everyone! sorry for the late reply—my brain was racing trying to catch up. for my gut pick, i’m a bit uneasy about parker. total silence on day 1 can be nerves, but it can also be someone hiding in plain sight. ray, i like the round-robin idea—parker, would you mind kicking us off? then maybe kennedy, dakota, and finish with me. parker, what’s on your mind
[17:37:48] Sam: hey everyone, interesting points so far. parker, i get why my eagerness might look like overcompensation, but i’m just trying to keep things moving. that said, i’m actually feeling uneasy about ray—twice you’ve jumped in with detailed plans and steered the convo before hearing much else (echoing kennedy’s point). parker calling me out could be deflection, so i’m watching you both closely. dakota, kennedy—where are you leaning right now? for me, ray’s at the top of my list, parker a close second, unless someone else stands out
[17:38:15] Sam: honestly, i’m still uneasy about parker’s day-one silence—it feels more strategic than shy. parker, what made you hold back so long? and how are you reading ray’s eagerness to steer our round-robin idea
[17:38:33] Sam: i’m voting ray—his constant steering and early round‐robin pushes feel overly tactical. parker, kennedy, dakota, you with me? let’s lock in ray
