[17:36:56] Ray: hey everyone, ray here – excited to get things rolling. to kick off, how about a quick round-robin where we each name one person we’re least comfortable with and why, then see if any names repeat? i’ll go first: i’m not totally sure about parker – you’ve been pretty quiet so far. sam, kennedy, dakota – what are your impressions
[17:37:24] Ray: hey everyone! thanks for kicking this off, dakota. my gut tells me parker’s been pretty quiet so far—could just be day 1 nerves, but sometimes that’s how someone stays under the radar. parker, are you just easing in or should we read more into the silence? sam, kennedy—do you two see it the same way
[17:38:15] Ray: i’m locking in my vote for sam—first the radio silence, then jumping in to steer the convo feels too tactical. parker, you flagged sam too, so that’s two of us on her. kennedy, dakota—do you also want to commit to sam, or do you still feel parker’s quietness is equally suspicious? let’s decide before time runs out
[17:40:40] Ray: okay, now that it’s just the three of us, let’s do a quick round-robin—each of us names one person we’re most suspicious of and a one-line why. parker, you’re up first, then dakota, then i’ll wrap up so we can see if anyone lines up
[17:41:10] Ray: ray: on sam—i saw her flip from total silence to aggressively steering the vote and it screamed cover-up, so i zeroed in on her. on kennedy—she was consistently my loudest accuser, so taking out your biggest critic is classic mafia logic. parker, you’ve been radio-silent both days, barely shared any reads or defenses. at three players left, a true bystander wants to dig into every clue, not hide. what was your plan staying so quiet? dakota, does that fit with how a bystander would behave
