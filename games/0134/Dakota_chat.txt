[17:36:53] Dakota: hey everyone! since it’s day 1, let’s get some chatter going. i propose we each share one quick gut impression before we start voting. i’ll go first: i noticed sam hasn’t said much yet—could be just shy, or maybe laying low. ray, what did you pick up? then parker and kennedy, you’re up
[17:37:27] Dakota: hey everyone! since we only have two minutes before votes, let’s do a super-quick round-robin: each of us calls out one person we’re feeling suspicious or comfortable with. i’m a bit wary of sam’s silence so far—sam, what’s your take? ray, you jumped in early last time; what made you so confident? parker, kennedy, over to you two
[17:38:18] Dakota: dakota: parker, since you were asked to kick off the round-robin, what’s your gut pick? after you share who you’re most uneasy with, i’ll go next and then sam can wrap it up
[17:38:36] Dakota: dakota: i see both sides here, but i’m still more uneasy about sam’s radio silence followed by that sudden critique—feels too tactical. i’m casting my vote for sam. let’s see if we get a clear majority
[17:39:59] Dakota: dakota: rough night, everyone. we’re down to three with one mafia among us. let’s do a quick gut-check—parker, who do you think pulled the trigger on kennedy and why? ray, then you. i’ll share mine last
[17:40:34] Dakota: dakota: alright ray and parker, since it’s just the three of us now and one of you is the last mafia, let’s get straight to it. ray—you drove hard on sam with that urgent push to vote her; what exactly tipped you off? parker—you pretty much sat back the whole day; what were you aiming for with that silence? i’m currently leaning toward parker, but lay out your defenses before i lock in my vote
[17:41:10] Dakota: dakota: i agree that kennedy’s death feels like a silencing of her critique of ray, so i’m leaning toward ray. but parker’s confidence popped up pretty suddenly, and i want to be sure we’re not following a deflection. ray, why target kennedy? parker, what makes you so sure now? after that, i’ll lock in my vote
