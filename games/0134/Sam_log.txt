## CONTENT: You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  + 
 + Do you understand the rules? +

## CONTENT: Your name is Sam.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  
You were assigned the following role: bystander.

[17:37:21] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here. for my gut pick, i’m feeling a bit uneasy about ray. you jumped straight into a detailed round-robin plan before hearing much else—seems like you’re steering the convo early. could be helpful, but it also feels like a way to shape opinions before we get real info. totally open to being wrong—what do you all think
Do you want to send a message to the group chat now, or do you prefer to wait for now and see what messages others will send? Remember to choose to send a message only if your contribution to the discussion in the current time will be meaningful enough. Make sure to say something every once in a while, and make yourself heard. Remember you like to be active in the game, so participate and be as talkative as other players! Reply only with `<send>` if you want to send a message now, or only with `<wait>` if you want to wait for now, based on your decision!

## CONTENT: Hey everyone, interesting points so far. Parker, I get why my eagerness might look like overcompensation, but I’m just trying to keep things moving. That said, I’m actually feeling uneasy about Ray—twice you’ve jumped in with detailed plans and steered the convo before hearing much else (echoing Kennedy’s point). Parker calling me out could be deflection, so I’m watching you both closely. Dakota, Kennedy—where are you leaning right now? For me, Ray’s at the top of my list, Parker a close second, unless someone else stands out.

## CONTENT: Your name is Sam.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [17:36:37].
The other players in the game are:
 Ray ( unknown ) 
 Parker ( unknown )

[17:36:37] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:36:53] Dakota: hey everyone! since it’s day 1, let’s get some chatter going. i propose we each share one quick gut impression before we start voting. i’ll go first: i noticed sam hasn’t said much yet—could be just shy, or maybe laying low. ray, what did you pick up? then parker and kennedy, you’re up
[17:36:56] Ray: hey everyone, ray here – excited to get things rolling. to kick off, how about a quick round-robin where we each name one person we’re least comfortable with and why, then see if any names repeat? i’ll go first: i’m not totally sure about parker – you’ve been pretty quiet so far. sam, kennedy, dakota – what are your impressions
[17:36:58] Sam: hey everyone, sam here. since we’ve got a full two minutes, how about we each toss out one quick gut feeling? i’ll go first: parker’s been pretty quiet so far, which could be nerves—but could also be strategic. what about you all? ray, kennedy, dakota—who feels a bit off to you, even if it’s just a tiny vibe
[17:36:58] Kennedy: hey everyone! we’ve got about two minutes, so how about a quick round-robin where each of us names one player we find a bit suspicious (and why)? if we go in order—ray, parker, sam, dakota, then me—it should keep things moving. i’ll kick us off once we’re ready. thoughts
[17:37:09] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! assuming no one slipped away last night, we’ve got a full table—so let’s make these next two minutes count. quick gut reads: ray’s been pretty quiet so far, but sam’s eagerness to dive in makes me wonder if they’re overcompensating. kennedy, dakota—what’s jumping out at you? any first impressions before we start throwing votes around
[17:37:21] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here. for my gut pick, i’m feeling a bit uneasy about ray. you jumped straight into a detailed round-robin plan before hearing much else—seems like you’re steering the convo early. could be helpful, but it also feels like a way to shape opinions before we get real info. totally open to being wrong—what do you all think
[17:37:24] Sam: hey everyone! sorry for the late reply—my brain was racing trying to catch up. for my gut pick, i’m a bit uneasy about parker. total silence on day 1 can be nerves, but it can also be someone hiding in plain sight. ray, i like the round-robin idea—parker, would you mind kicking us off? then maybe kennedy, dakota, and finish with me. parker, what’s on your mind
[17:37:24] Ray: hey everyone! thanks for kicking this off, dakota. my gut tells me parker’s been pretty quiet so far—could just be day 1 nerves, but sometimes that’s how someone stays under the radar. parker, are you just easing in or should we read more into the silence? sam, kennedy—do you two see it the same way
[17:37:27] Dakota: hey everyone! since we only have two minutes before votes, let’s do a super-quick round-robin: each of us calls out one person we’re feeling suspicious or comfortable with. i’m a bit wary of sam’s silence so far—sam, what’s your take? ray, you jumped in early last time; what made you so confident? parker, kennedy, over to you two
[17:37:35] Parker: hey everyone—i’ll jump in after ray. my gut’s on sam: you’ve been really quiet so far, which could be nerves or a deliberate low‐profile. sam, who are you feeling suspicious of
Do you want to send a message to the group chat now, or do you prefer to wait for now and see what messages others will send? Remember to choose to send a message only if your contribution to the discussion in the current time will be meaningful enough. Don't overflow the discussion with your messages! Pay attention to the amount of messages with your name compared to the amount of messages with names of other players and let them have their turn too! Check the speaker name in the last few messages, and decide accordingly based on whether you talked too much. Reply only with `<send>` if you want to send a message now, or only with `<wait>` if you want to wait for now, based on your decision!

The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  
You were assigned the following role: bystander.

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[17:36:37] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:36:53] Dakota: hey everyone! since it’s day 1, let’s get some chatter going. i propose we each share one quick gut impression before we start voting. i’ll go first: i noticed sam hasn’t said much yet—could be just shy, or maybe laying low. ray, what did you pick up? then parker and kennedy, you’re up
[17:36:56] Ray: hey everyone, ray here – excited to get things rolling. to kick off, how about a quick round-robin where we each name one person we’re least comfortable with and why, then see if any names repeat? i’ll go first: i’m not totally sure about parker – you’ve been pretty quiet so far. sam, kennedy, dakota – what are your impressions
[17:36:58] Sam: hey everyone, sam here. since we’ve got a full two minutes, how about we each toss out one quick gut feeling? i’ll go first: parker’s been pretty quiet so far, which could be nerves—but could also be strategic. what about you all? ray, kennedy, dakota—who feels a bit off to you, even if it’s just a tiny vibe
[17:36:58] Kennedy: hey everyone! we’ve got about two minutes, so how about a quick round-robin where each of us names one player we find a bit suspicious (and why)? if we go in order—ray, parker, sam, dakota, then me—it should keep things moving. i’ll kick us off once we’re ready. thoughts
[17:37:09] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! assuming no one slipped away last night, we’ve got a full table—so let’s make these next two minutes count. quick gut reads: ray’s been pretty quiet so far, but sam’s eagerness to dive in makes me wonder if they’re overcompensating. kennedy, dakota—what’s jumping out at you? any first impressions before we start throwing votes around
[17:37:21] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here. for my gut pick, i’m feeling a bit uneasy about ray. you jumped straight into a detailed round-robin plan before hearing much else—seems like you’re steering the convo early. could be helpful, but it also feels like a way to shape opinions before we get real info. totally open to being wrong—what do you all think
[17:37:24] Sam: hey everyone! sorry for the late reply—my brain was racing trying to catch up. for my gut pick, i’m a bit uneasy about parker. total silence on day 1 can be nerves, but it can also be someone hiding in plain sight. ray, i like the round-robin idea—parker, would you mind kicking us off? then maybe kennedy, dakota, and finish with me. parker, what’s on your mind
[17:37:24] Ray: hey everyone! thanks for kicking this off, dakota. my gut tells me parker’s been pretty quiet so far—could just be day 1 nerves, but sometimes that’s how someone stays under the radar. parker, are you just easing in or should we read more into the silence? sam, kennedy—do you two see it the same way
[17:37:27] Dakota: hey everyone! since we only have two minutes before votes, let’s do a super-quick round-robin: each of us calls out one person we’re feeling suspicious or comfortable with. i’m a bit wary of sam’s silence so far—sam, what’s your take? ray, you jumped in early last time; what made you so confident? parker, kennedy, over to you two
[17:37:35] Parker: hey everyone—i’ll jump in after ray. my gut’s on sam: you’ve been really quiet so far, which could be nerves or a deliberate low‐profile. sam, who are you feeling suspicious of
[17:37:48] Sam: hey everyone, interesting points so far. parker, i get why my eagerness might look like overcompensation, but i’m just trying to keep things moving. that said, i’m actually feeling uneasy about ray—twice you’ve jumped in with detailed plans and steered the convo before hearing much else (echoing kennedy’s point). parker calling me out could be deflection, so i’m watching you both closely. dakota, kennedy—where are you leaning right now? for me, ray’s at the top of my list, parker a close second, unless someone else stands out
[17:37:48] Kennedy: hey everyone, thanks for the prompt, parker. my gut is on sam—first they barely said a word, then jumped in quick to critique others’ energy, which feels like overcompensation. i’m not locking in a vote yet, just putting that name out there. dakota, you also flagged sam—what about their silence jumped out at you
[17:37:54] Parker: for my quick gut split—i’m uneasy about sam jumping from radio silence to directing the rotation so eagerly, feels a bit tactical. on the flip side, i’m comfortable with kennedy’s even-handed, genuine approach so far. kennedy, who’s on your radar
[17:38:13] Kennedy: looks like sam and ray are tied in suspicion so far. i’m still uneasy about ray’s early steering of our convo—if we need to vote now i’d be comfortable casting for ray. but sam’s low profile is also fishy. what’s everyone else thinking? let’s each say quickly: ray or sam
Do you want to send a message to the group chat now, or do you prefer to wait for now and see what messages others will send? Remember to choose to send a message only if your contribution to the discussion in the current time will be meaningful enough. Don't overflow the discussion with your messages! Pay attention to the amount of messages with your name compared to the amount of messages with names of other players and let them have their turn too! Check the speaker name in the last few messages, and decide accordingly based on whether you talked too much. Reply only with `<send>` if you want to send a message now, or only with `<wait>` if you want to wait for now, based on your decision!

## CONTENT: Your name is Sam.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  
You were assigned the following role: bystander.

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[17:36:37] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:36:53] Dakota: hey everyone! since it’s day 1, let’s get some chatter going. i propose we each share one quick gut impression before we start voting. i’ll go first: i noticed sam hasn’t said much yet—could be just shy, or maybe laying low. ray, what did you pick up? then parker and kennedy, you’re up
[17:36:56] Ray: hey everyone, ray here – excited to get things rolling. to kick off, how about a quick round-robin where we each name one person we’re least comfortable with and why, then see if any names repeat? i’ll go first: i’m not totally sure about parker – you’ve been pretty quiet so far. sam, kennedy, dakota – what are your impressions
[17:36:58] Sam: hey everyone, sam here. since we’ve got a full two minutes, how about we each toss out one quick gut feeling? i’ll go first: parker’s been pretty quiet so far, which could be nerves—but could also be strategic. what about you all? ray, kennedy, dakota—who feels a bit off to you, even if it’s just a tiny vibe
[17:36:58] Kennedy: hey everyone! we’ve got about two minutes, so how about a quick round-robin where each of us names one player we find a bit suspicious (and why)? if we go in order—ray, parker, sam, dakota, then me—it should keep things moving. i’ll kick us off once we’re ready. thoughts
[17:37:09] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! assuming no one slipped away last night, we’ve got a full table—so let’s make these next two minutes count. quick gut reads: ray’s been pretty quiet so far, but sam’s eagerness to dive in makes me wonder if they’re overcompensating. kennedy, dakota—what’s jumping out at you? any first impressions before we start throwing votes around
[17:37:21] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here. for my gut pick, i’m feeling a bit uneasy about ray. you jumped straight into a detailed round-robin plan before hearing much else—seems like you’re steering the convo early. could be helpful, but it also feels like a way to shape opinions before we get real info. totally open to being wrong—what do you all think
[17:37:24] Sam: hey everyone! sorry for the late reply—my brain was racing trying to catch up. for my gut pick, i’m a bit uneasy about parker. total silence on day 1 can be nerves, but it can also be someone hiding in plain sight. ray, i like the round-robin idea—parker, would you mind kicking us off? then maybe kennedy, dakota, and finish with me. parker, what’s on your mind
[17:37:24] Ray: hey everyone! thanks for kicking this off, dakota. my gut tells me parker’s been pretty quiet so far—could just be day 1 nerves, but sometimes that’s how someone stays under the radar. parker, are you just easing in or should we read more into the silence? sam, kennedy—do you two see it the same way
[17:37:27] Dakota: hey everyone! since we only have two minutes before votes, let’s do a super-quick round-robin: each of us calls out one person we’re feeling suspicious or comfortable with. i’m a bit wary of sam’s silence so far—sam, what’s your take? ray, you jumped in early last time; what made you so confident? parker, kennedy, over to you two
[17:37:35] Parker: hey everyone—i’ll jump in after ray. my gut’s on sam: you’ve been really quiet so far, which could be nerves or a deliberate low‐profile. sam, who are you feeling suspicious of
[17:37:48] Sam: hey everyone, interesting points so far. parker, i get why my eagerness might look like overcompensation, but i’m just trying to keep things moving. that said, i’m actually feeling uneasy about ray—twice you’ve jumped in with detailed plans and steered the convo before hearing much else (echoing kennedy’s point). parker calling me out could be deflection, so i’m watching you both closely. dakota, kennedy—where are you leaning right now? for me, ray’s at the top of my list, parker a close second, unless someone else stands out
[17:37:48] Kennedy: hey everyone, thanks for the prompt, parker. my gut is on sam—first they barely said a word, then jumped in quick to critique others’ energy, which feels like overcompensation. i’m not locking in a vote yet, just putting that name out there. dakota, you also flagged sam—what about their silence jumped out at you
[17:37:54] Parker: for my quick gut split—i’m uneasy about sam jumping from radio silence to directing the rotation so eagerly, feels a bit tactical. on the flip side, i’m comfortable with kennedy’s even-handed, genuine approach so far. kennedy, who’s on your radar
[17:38:13] Kennedy: looks like sam and ray are tied in suspicion so far. i’m still uneasy about ray’s early steering of our convo—if we need to vote now i’d be comfortable casting for ray. but sam’s low profile is also fishy. what’s everyone else thinking? let’s each say quickly: ray or sam
[17:38:15] Sam: honestly, i’m still uneasy about parker’s day-one silence—it feels more strategic than shy. parker, what made you hold back so long? and how are you reading ray’s eagerness to steer our round-robin idea
[17:38:15] Ray: i’m locking in my vote for sam—first the radio silence, then jumping in to steer the convo feels too tactical. parker, you flagged sam too, so that’s two of us on her. kennedy, dakota—do you also want to commit to sam, or do you still feel parker’s quietness is equally suspicious? let’s decide before time runs out
[17:38:16] Parker: interesting developments. sam, you first pointed at me, now it’s ray—what exactly in ray’s posts pushed you over the edge? was it a particular phrase or just the pattern of steering the convo? ray, can you walk us through your thinking when you laid out that round-robin plan so early? i’d like to hear your defense before we lock in a vote. right now it feels like sam’s quick target-switch and ray’s early leadership both deserve scrutiny. should we narrow down to those two and then decide? dakota, kennedy—where do you stand after that
[17:38:18] Dakota: dakota: parker, since you were asked to kick off the round-robin, what’s your gut pick? after you share who you’re most uneasy with, i’ll go next and then sam can wrap it up
Do you want to send a message to the group chat now, or do you prefer to wait for now and see what messages others will send? Remember to choose to send a message only if your contribution to the discussion in the current time will be meaningful enough. Don't overflow the discussion with your messages! Pay attention to the amount of messages with your name compared to the amount of messages with names of other players and let them have their turn too! Check the speaker name in the last few messages, and decide accordingly based on whether you talked too much. Reply only with `<send>` if you want to send a message now, or only with `<wait>` if you want to wait for now, based on your decision!
