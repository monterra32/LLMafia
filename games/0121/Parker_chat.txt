[16:51:39] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! happy to kick off day 1. we’ve got no reads yet, so why don’t we each share a quick gut feeling or strategy for how to tackle this? i’m personally uneasy about complete silence—what’s everyone else thinking
[16:51:54] Parker: hey everyone, parker here. since we’ve got two minutes this morning, let’s start sharing gut reads. i haven’t seen much to go on yet, so i’m hesitant to cast a vote—but i’m watching sam and ray, both being unusually quiet for day 1. kennedy, dakota, what are you both picking up so far
[16:52:24] Parker: hey everyone, thanks for sharing your tells and gut reads. my two cents: i’m most suspicious of kennedy—calling out ray & me this early feels a bit deflect-y, though i could be wrong. ray, you mentioned kennedy’s silence; what did you pick up? sam & dakota, where are you leaning? maybe we each name a top suspect now so we can start zeroing in
[16:52:52] Parker: i usually wait until about the one-minute mark or until at least three people have dropped a quick gut read—that way i’m not rushing things. we’re right there now, so let’s each post a one-liner gut vote. i’m leaning toward sam (lots of tactic talk but light on real reads). what about you all? ray, kennedy, dakota—who’s your pick
[16:53:04] Parker: i’d vote for kennedy—they jumped in early to frame both ray and me with almost no evidence, which feels like classic mafia misdirection
