## CONTENT: You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  +

## CONTENT: Your name is Ray.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  
You were assigned the following role: mafia. 
The game's chat room was open at [16:51:21].

[16:51:52] Ray: hey everyone! now that day’s started, what are your gut feelings? i’m watching kennedy—they’ve been totally quiet so far. could just be reserved, but could also be hiding something. who are you all eyeing
[16:51:53] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! since it’s been oddly quiet so far, i’m watching those flying under the radar—i’ve got my eye on ray and parker at the moment. what about you all? who’s your early gut pick for mafia
[16:51:54] Parker: hey everyone, parker here. since we’ve got two minutes this morning, let’s start sharing gut reads. i haven’t seen much to go on yet, so i’m hesitant to cast a vote—but i’m watching sam and ray, both being unusually quiet for day 1. kennedy, dakota, what are you both picking up so far
[16:52:07] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here! day 1 energy. parker’s right—total silence stands out. sam, you okay? just checking we didn’t miss your hello. how about a quick ice-breaker: each of us drops a one-line gut read on someone else. i’m mildly suspicious of sam since i’ve heard nada—could be nothing or a tactic. ray? kennedy? parker? who’s catching your eye so far
[16:52:10] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here!  

for me, a big mafia tell is when someone over-explains or piles on qualifiers—lots of “i could be wrong” or “just saying” can feel like they’re trying too hard. i tend to hang back day 1 and soak in everyone’s tone before throwing out an accusation.  

ray, i know my quiet approach can look suspicious—i’m just more of a listener until patterns emerge. no hard reads yet, but i’m watching who nudges the convo toward an early vote. what little linguistic quirks have caught your eye so far?
[16:52:10] Sam: sam: nice one, dakota! my go-to text tell is the “question deflect”—someone who fires off tons of questions but never really shares their own read. i also watch response length—super long or super short messages feel off. what about you, ray, parker, kennedy—any tells you’re tracking
Do you want to send a message to the group chat now, or do you prefer to wait for now and see what messages others will send? Remember to choose to send a message only if your contribution to the discussion in the current time will be meaningful enough. Make sure to say something every once in a while, and make yourself heard. Remember you like to be active in the game, so participate and be as talkative as other players! Reply only with `<send>` if you want to send a message now, or only with `<wait>` if you want to wait for now, based on your decision!

[16:51:53] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! since it’s been oddly quiet so far, i’m watching those flying under the radar—i’ve got my eye on ray and parker at the moment. what about you all? who’s your early gut pick for mafia
[16:51:54] Parker: hey everyone, parker here. since we’ve got two minutes this morning, let’s start sharing gut reads. i haven’t seen much to go on yet, so i’m hesitant to cast a vote—but i’m watching sam and ray, both being unusually quiet for day 1. kennedy, dakota, what are you both picking up so far
[16:52:07] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here! day 1 energy. parker’s right—total silence stands out. sam, you okay? just checking we didn’t miss your hello. how about a quick ice-breaker: each of us drops a one-line gut read on someone else. i’m mildly suspicious of sam since i’ve heard nada—could be nothing or a tactic. ray? kennedy? parker? who’s catching your eye so far
[16:52:10] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here!  

for me, a big mafia tell is when someone over-explains or piles on qualifiers—lots of “i could be wrong” or “just saying” can feel like they’re trying too hard. i tend to hang back day 1 and soak in everyone’s tone before throwing out an accusation.  

ray, i know my quiet approach can look suspicious—i’m just more of a listener until patterns emerge. no hard reads yet, but i’m watching who nudges the convo toward an early vote. what little linguistic quirks have caught your eye so far?
[16:52:10] Sam: sam: nice one, dakota! my go-to text tell is the “question deflect”—someone who fires off tons of questions but never really shares their own read. i also watch response length—super long or super short messages feel off. what about you, ray, parker, kennedy—any tells you’re tracking

## CONTENT: Your name is Ray.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  
You were assigned the following role: mafia. 
The game's chat room was open at [16:51:21].
The other players in the game are:
 Parker ( bystander ) 
 Sam ( bystander )

 Dakota ( bystander ) 
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[16:51:21] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[16:51:39] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! happy to kick off day 1. we’ve got no reads yet, so why don’t we each share a quick gut feeling or strategy for how to tackle this? i’m personally uneasy about complete silence—what’s everyone else thinking
[16:51:49] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here—excited to get started! since it’s day 1 and we’ve got no clues yet, how about we each share our go-to mafia tell in text? i’ll kick us off: i tend to watch for folks who immediately steer the convo—it can be over-eagerness from mafia or a bystander trying too hard. ray, parker, sam, kennedy—what’s your tell of choice
[16:51:49] Sam: hey all, sam here! excited to get started. do you folks like to jump right into accusations or hang back a bit to watch everyone’s behavior first? i tend to observe who’s trying to dominate the convo or who suddenly goes too quiet. what about you
[16:51:52] Ray: hey everyone! now that day’s started, what are your gut feelings? i’m watching kennedy—they’ve been totally quiet so far. could just be reserved, but could also be hiding something. who are you all eyeing
[16:51:53] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! since it’s been oddly quiet so far, i’m watching those flying under the radar—i’ve got my eye on ray and parker at the moment. what about you all? who’s your early gut pick for mafia
[16:51:54] Parker: hey everyone, parker here. since we’ve got two minutes this morning, let’s start sharing gut reads. i haven’t seen much to go on yet, so i’m hesitant to cast a vote—but i’m watching sam and ray, both being unusually quiet for day 1. kennedy, dakota, what are you both picking up so far
[16:52:07] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here! day 1 energy. parker’s right—total silence stands out. sam, you okay? just checking we didn’t miss your hello. how about a quick ice-breaker: each of us drops a one-line gut read on someone else. i’m mildly suspicious of sam since i’ve heard nada—could be nothing or a tactic. ray? kennedy? parker? who’s catching your eye so far
[16:52:10] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here!  

for me, a big mafia tell is when someone over-explains or piles on qualifiers—lots of “i could be wrong” or “just saying” can feel like they’re trying too hard. i tend to hang back day 1 and soak in everyone’s tone before throwing out an accusation.  

ray, i know my quiet approach can look suspicious—i’m just more of a listener until patterns emerge. no hard reads yet, but i’m watching who nudges the convo toward an early vote. what little linguistic quirks have caught your eye so far?
[16:52:10] Sam: sam: nice one, dakota! my go-to text tell is the “question deflect”—someone who fires off tons of questions but never really shares their own read. i also watch response length—super long or super short messages feel off. what about you, ray, parker, kennedy—any tells you’re tracking
[16:52:19] Ray: hey all, ray chiming in! i’m with parker—total silence makes me antsy, but i’m also wary of anyone grabbing the mic too fast. on day 1 i usually hang back for about 30 seconds to see who says what before tossing out questions or suspicions. my go-to mafia tell is when someone over-disclaims every line with “no offense” or “just saying”—feels defensive. how about you guys—what’s your timeline before you make a first move or call someone out
[16:52:24] Parker: hey everyone, thanks for sharing your tells and gut reads. my two cents: i’m most suspicious of kennedy—calling out ray & me this early feels a bit deflect-y, though i could be wrong. ray, you mentioned kennedy’s silence; what did you pick up? sam & dakota, where are you leaning? maybe we each name a top suspect now so we can start zeroing in
[16:52:28] Dakota: i’m noticing we’ve had eyes on ray and parker… but sam still hasn’t named a single suspect. if i had to cast a vote right now, i’d lean toward sam for flying too neutral. ray, parker, kennedy—who would you vote for if we had to pick someone immediately
[16:52:42] Kennedy: here’s my one-liner gut read: parker’s eagerness to frame sam and ray feels a bit too neat—could be a classic mafia misdirection. thoughts
[16:52:49] Sam: how about we turn all these tells into action with a quick round-robin gut read? each person names who they’d vote for right now and gives a one-sentence why. i’ll go last so nobody feels pinned, but i think seeing any overlap could point us toward someone. parker, want to start
[16:52:52] Parker: i usually wait until about the one-minute mark or until at least three people have dropped a quick gut read—that way i’m not rushing things. we’re right there now, so let’s each post a one-liner gut vote. i’m leaning toward sam (lots of tactic talk but light on real reads). what about you all? ray, kennedy, dakota—who’s your pick
[16:52:55] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here—parker, good point on kennedy’s early deflection. ray, what specifically about kennedy’s messages gives you pause? i’m still hung up on sam’s radio silence—sam, what’s your lean? i’m tentatively eyeing sam today, with kennedy a close second if sam speaks up. ray, parker, thoughts on that split
Do you want to send a message to the group chat now, or do you prefer to wait for now and see what messages others will send? Remember to choose to send a message only if your contribution to the discussion in the current time will be meaningful enough. Make sure to say something every once in a while, and make yourself heard. Remember you like to be active in the game, so participate and be as talkative as other players! Reply only with `<send>` if you want to send a message now, or only with `<wait>` if you want to wait for now, based on your decision!

[16:51:52] Ray: hey everyone! now that day’s started, what are your gut feelings? i’m watching kennedy—they’ve been totally quiet so far. could just be reserved, but could also be hiding something. who are you all eyeing
[16:51:53] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! since it’s been oddly quiet so far, i’m watching those flying under the radar—i’ve got my eye on ray and parker at the moment. what about you all? who’s your early gut pick for mafia
[16:51:54] Parker: hey everyone, parker here. since we’ve got two minutes this morning, let’s start sharing gut reads. i haven’t seen much to go on yet, so i’m hesitant to cast a vote—but i’m watching sam and ray, both being unusually quiet for day 1. kennedy, dakota, what are you both picking up so far
[16:52:07] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here! day 1 energy. parker’s right—total silence stands out. sam, you okay? just checking we didn’t miss your hello. how about a quick ice-breaker: each of us drops a one-line gut read on someone else. i’m mildly suspicious of sam since i’ve heard nada—could be nothing or a tactic. ray? kennedy? parker? who’s catching your eye so far
[16:52:10] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here!  

for me, a big mafia tell is when someone over-explains or piles on qualifiers—lots of “i could be wrong” or “just saying” can feel like they’re trying too hard. i tend to hang back day 1 and soak in everyone’s tone before throwing out an accusation.  

ray, i know my quiet approach can look suspicious—i’m just more of a listener until patterns emerge. no hard reads yet, but i’m watching who nudges the convo toward an early vote. what little linguistic quirks have caught your eye so far?
[16:52:10] Sam: sam: nice one, dakota! my go-to text tell is the “question deflect”—someone who fires off tons of questions but never really shares their own read. i also watch response length—super long or super short messages feel off. what about you, ray, parker, kennedy—any tells you’re tracking
[16:52:19] Ray: hey all, ray chiming in! i’m with parker—total silence makes me antsy, but i’m also wary of anyone grabbing the mic too fast. on day 1 i usually hang back for about 30 seconds to see who says what before tossing out questions or suspicions. my go-to mafia tell is when someone over-disclaims every line with “no offense” or “just saying”—feels defensive. how about you guys—what’s your timeline before you make a first move or call someone out
[16:52:24] Parker: hey everyone, thanks for sharing your tells and gut reads. my two cents: i’m most suspicious of kennedy—calling out ray & me this early feels a bit deflect-y, though i could be wrong. ray, you mentioned kennedy’s silence; what did you pick up? sam & dakota, where are you leaning? maybe we each name a top suspect now so we can start zeroing in
[16:52:28] Dakota: i’m noticing we’ve had eyes on ray and parker… but sam still hasn’t named a single suspect. if i had to cast a vote right now, i’d lean toward sam for flying too neutral. ray, parker, kennedy—who would you vote for if we had to pick someone immediately
[16:52:42] Kennedy: here’s my one-liner gut read: parker’s eagerness to frame sam and ray feels a bit too neat—could be a classic mafia misdirection. thoughts
[16:52:49] Sam: how about we turn all these tells into action with a quick round-robin gut read? each person names who they’d vote for right now and gives a one-sentence why. i’ll go last so nobody feels pinned, but i think seeing any overlap could point us toward someone. parker, want to start
[16:52:52] Parker: i usually wait until about the one-minute mark or until at least three people have dropped a quick gut read—that way i’m not rushing things. we’re right there now, so let’s each post a one-liner gut vote. i’m leaning toward sam (lots of tactic talk but light on real reads). what about you all? ray, kennedy, dakota—who’s your pick
[16:52:55] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here—parker, good point on kennedy’s early deflection. ray, what specifically about kennedy’s messages gives you pause? i’m still hung up on sam’s radio silence—sam, what’s your lean? i’m tentatively eyeing sam today, with kennedy a close second if sam speaks up. ray, parker, thoughts on that split

[16:53:01] Ray: good points, everyone. my own tell is when someone zig-zags from heavy hedging to sudden certainty in one go. parker just jumped on sam and me for being “too quiet” almost out of nowhere—that feels like projection to pull focus off themselves. my one-line gut read: i’m wary of parker. but it’s still day 1, so i’m open—sam, kennedy, dakota, who’s on your radar right now
[16:53:04] Parker: i’d vote for kennedy—they jumped in early to frame both ray and me with almost no evidence, which feels like classic mafia misdirection
[16:53:10] Sam: i get why my quiet start looks odd, but i’m just parsing everyone’s vibes. if we had to vote right now, i’d lean parker—too eager to pin on me then flip to shift suspicion elsewhere feels like classic misdirection. kennedy, does that match your take on parker? ray? dakota? where are you all landing
[16:53:15] Dakota: dakota: i’m voting sam—tons of tactic talk but zero concrete reads so far, feels like the safest “neutral” spot to hide
[16:53:21] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
From the following remaining players, which player you want to vote for to lynch? Base your answer on the conversation as seen in the message history, and especially on what you (Ray) said.

[16:51:49] Sam: hey all, sam here! excited to get started. do you folks like to jump right into accusations or hang back a bit to watch everyone’s behavior first? i tend to observe who’s trying to dominate the convo or who suddenly goes too quiet. what about you
[16:51:52] Ray: hey everyone! now that day’s started, what are your gut feelings? i’m watching kennedy—they’ve been totally quiet so far. could just be reserved, but could also be hiding something. who are you all eyeing
[16:51:53] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! since it’s been oddly quiet so far, i’m watching those flying under the radar—i’ve got my eye on ray and parker at the moment. what about you all? who’s your early gut pick for mafia
[16:51:54] Parker: hey everyone, parker here. since we’ve got two minutes this morning, let’s start sharing gut reads. i haven’t seen much to go on yet, so i’m hesitant to cast a vote—but i’m watching sam and ray, both being unusually quiet for day 1. kennedy, dakota, what are you both picking up so far
[16:52:07] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here! day 1 energy. parker’s right—total silence stands out. sam, you okay? just checking we didn’t miss your hello. how about a quick ice-breaker: each of us drops a one-line gut read on someone else. i’m mildly suspicious of sam since i’ve heard nada—could be nothing or a tactic. ray? kennedy? parker? who’s catching your eye so far
[16:52:10] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here!  

for me, a big mafia tell is when someone over-explains or piles on qualifiers—lots of “i could be wrong” or “just saying” can feel like they’re trying too hard. i tend to hang back day 1 and soak in everyone’s tone before throwing out an accusation.  

ray, i know my quiet approach can look suspicious—i’m just more of a listener until patterns emerge. no hard reads yet, but i’m watching who nudges the convo toward an early vote. what little linguistic quirks have caught your eye so far?
[16:52:10] Sam: sam: nice one, dakota! my go-to text tell is the “question deflect”—someone who fires off tons of questions but never really shares their own read. i also watch response length—super long or super short messages feel off. what about you, ray, parker, kennedy—any tells you’re tracking
[16:52:19] Ray: hey all, ray chiming in! i’m with parker—total silence makes me antsy, but i’m also wary of anyone grabbing the mic too fast. on day 1 i usually hang back for about 30 seconds to see who says what before tossing out questions or suspicions. my go-to mafia tell is when someone over-disclaims every line with “no offense” or “just saying”—feels defensive. how about you guys—what’s your timeline before you make a first move or call someone out
[16:52:24] Parker: hey everyone, thanks for sharing your tells and gut reads. my two cents: i’m most suspicious of kennedy—calling out ray & me this early feels a bit deflect-y, though i could be wrong. ray, you mentioned kennedy’s silence; what did you pick up? sam & dakota, where are you leaning? maybe we each name a top suspect now so we can start zeroing in
[16:52:28] Dakota: i’m noticing we’ve had eyes on ray and parker… but sam still hasn’t named a single suspect. if i had to cast a vote right now, i’d lean toward sam for flying too neutral. ray, parker, kennedy—who would you vote for if we had to pick someone immediately
[16:52:42] Kennedy: here’s my one-liner gut read: parker’s eagerness to frame sam and ray feels a bit too neat—could be a classic mafia misdirection. thoughts
[16:52:49] Sam: how about we turn all these tells into action with a quick round-robin gut read? each person names who they’d vote for right now and gives a one-sentence why. i’ll go last so nobody feels pinned, but i think seeing any overlap could point us toward someone. parker, want to start
[16:52:52] Parker: i usually wait until about the one-minute mark or until at least three people have dropped a quick gut read—that way i’m not rushing things. we’re right there now, so let’s each post a one-liner gut vote. i’m leaning toward sam (lots of tactic talk but light on real reads). what about you all? ray, kennedy, dakota—who’s your pick
[16:52:55] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here—parker, good point on kennedy’s early deflection. ray, what specifically about kennedy’s messages gives you pause? i’m still hung up on sam’s radio silence—sam, what’s your lean? i’m tentatively eyeing sam today, with kennedy a close second if sam speaks up. ray, parker, thoughts on that split
[16:53:01] Ray: good points, everyone. my own tell is when someone zig-zags from heavy hedging to sudden certainty in one go. parker just jumped on sam and me for being “too quiet” almost out of nowhere—that feels like projection to pull focus off themselves. my one-line gut read: i’m wary of parker. but it’s still day 1, so i’m open—sam, kennedy, dakota, who’s on your radar right now
[16:53:04] Parker: i’d vote for kennedy—they jumped in early to frame both ray and me with almost no evidence, which feels like classic mafia misdirection
[16:53:10] Sam: i get why my quiet start looks odd, but i’m just parsing everyone’s vibes. if we had to vote right now, i’d lean parker—too eager to pin on me then flip to shift suspicion elsewhere feels like classic misdirection. kennedy, does that match your take on parker? ray? dakota? where are you all landing
[16:53:15] Dakota: dakota: i’m voting sam—tons of tactic talk but zero concrete reads so far, feels like the safest “neutral” spot to hide
[16:53:21] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
From the following remaining players, which player you want to vote for to lynch? Base your answer on the conversation as seen in the message history, and especially on what you (Ray) said.

## CONTENT: Your name is Ray.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  
You were assigned the following role: mafia. 
The game's chat room was open at [16:51:21].

## CONTENT: Your name is Ray.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  
You were assigned the following role: mafia. 
The game's chat room was open at [16:51:21].
The other players in the game are:
 Parker ( bystander ) 
 Sam ( bystander ) 
 Kennedy ( bystander ) 
 Dakota ( bystander ) 
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
Sam ( bystander ) 
Dakota ( bystander )

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[16:51:21] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[16:51:39] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! happy to kick off day 1. we’ve got no reads yet, so why don’t we each share a quick gut feeling or strategy for how to tackle this? i’m personally uneasy about complete silence—what’s everyone else thinking
[16:51:49] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here—excited to get started! since it’s day 1 and we’ve got no clues yet, how about we each share our go-to mafia tell in text? i’ll kick us off: i tend to watch for folks who immediately steer the convo—it can be over-eagerness from mafia or a bystander trying too hard. ray, parker, sam, kennedy—what’s your tell of choice
[16:51:49] Sam: hey all, sam here! excited to get started. do you folks like to jump right into accusations or hang back a bit to watch everyone’s behavior first? i tend to observe who’s trying to dominate the convo or who suddenly goes too quiet. what about you
[16:51:52] Ray: hey everyone! now that day’s started, what are your gut feelings? i’m watching kennedy—they’ve been totally quiet so far. could just be reserved, but could also be hiding something. who are you all eyeing
[16:51:53] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! since it’s been oddly quiet so far, i’m watching those flying under the radar—i’ve got my eye on ray and parker at the moment. what about you all? who’s your early gut pick for mafia
[16:51:54] Parker: hey everyone, parker here. since we’ve got two minutes this morning, let’s start sharing gut reads. i haven’t seen much to go on yet, so i’m hesitant to cast a vote—but i’m watching sam and ray, both being unusually quiet for day 1. kennedy, dakota, what are you both picking up so far
[16:52:07] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here! day 1 energy. parker’s right—total silence stands out. sam, you okay? just checking we didn’t miss your hello. how about a quick ice-breaker: each of us drops a one-line gut read on someone else. i’m mildly suspicious of sam since i’ve heard nada—could be nothing or a tactic. ray? kennedy? parker? who’s catching your eye so far
[16:52:10] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here!  

for me, a big mafia tell is when someone over-explains or piles on qualifiers—lots of “i could be wrong” or “just saying” can feel like they’re trying too hard. i tend to hang back day 1 and soak in everyone’s tone before throwing out an accusation.  

ray, i know my quiet approach can look suspicious—i’m just more of a listener until patterns emerge. no hard reads yet, but i’m watching who nudges the convo toward an early vote. what little linguistic quirks have caught your eye so far?
[16:52:10] Sam: sam: nice one, dakota! my go-to text tell is the “question deflect”—someone who fires off tons of questions but never really shares their own read. i also watch response length—super long or super short messages feel off. what about you, ray, parker, kennedy—any tells you’re tracking
[16:52:19] Ray: hey all, ray chiming in! i’m with parker—total silence makes me antsy, but i’m also wary of anyone grabbing the mic too fast. on day 1 i usually hang back for about 30 seconds to see who says what before tossing out questions or suspicions. my go-to mafia tell is when someone over-disclaims every line with “no offense” or “just saying”—feels defensive. how about you guys—what’s your timeline before you make a first move or call someone out
[16:52:24] Parker: hey everyone, thanks for sharing your tells and gut reads. my two cents: i’m most suspicious of kennedy—calling out ray & me this early feels a bit deflect-y, though i could be wrong. ray, you mentioned kennedy’s silence; what did you pick up? sam & dakota, where are you leaning? maybe we each name a top suspect now so we can start zeroing in
[16:52:28] Dakota: i’m noticing we’ve had eyes on ray and parker… but sam still hasn’t named a single suspect. if i had to cast a vote right now, i’d lean toward sam for flying too neutral. ray, parker, kennedy—who would you vote for if we had to pick someone immediately
[16:52:42] Kennedy: here’s my one-liner gut read: parker’s eagerness to frame sam and ray feels a bit too neat—could be a classic mafia misdirection. thoughts
[16:52:49] Sam: how about we turn all these tells into action with a quick round-robin gut read? each person names who they’d vote for right now and gives a one-sentence why. i’ll go last so nobody feels pinned, but i think seeing any overlap could point us toward someone. parker, want to start
[16:52:52] Parker: i usually wait until about the one-minute mark or until at least three people have dropped a quick gut read—that way i’m not rushing things. we’re right there now, so let’s each post a one-liner gut vote. i’m leaning toward sam (lots of tactic talk but light on real reads). what about you all? ray, kennedy, dakota—who’s your pick
[16:52:55] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here—parker, good point on kennedy’s early deflection. ray, what specifically about kennedy’s messages gives you pause? i’m still hung up on sam’s radio silence—sam, what’s your lean? i’m tentatively eyeing sam today, with kennedy a close second if sam speaks up. ray, parker, thoughts on that split
[16:53:01] Ray: good points, everyone. my own tell is when someone zig-zags from heavy hedging to sudden certainty in one go. parker just jumped on sam and me for being “too quiet” almost out of nowhere—that feels like projection to pull focus off themselves. my one-line gut read: i’m wary of parker. but it’s still day 1, so i’m open—sam, kennedy, dakota, who’s on your radar right now
[16:53:04] Parker: i’d vote for kennedy—they jumped in early to frame both ray and me with almost no evidence, which feels like classic mafia misdirection
[16:53:10] Sam: i get why my quiet start looks odd, but i’m just parsing everyone’s vibes. if we had to vote right now, i’d lean parker—too eager to pin on me then flip to shift suspicion elsewhere feels like classic misdirection. kennedy, does that match your take on parker? ray? dakota? where are you all landing
[16:53:15] Dakota: dakota: i’m voting sam—tons of tactic talk but zero concrete reads so far, feels like the safest “neutral” spot to hide
[16:53:21] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[16:53:36] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Kennedy
[16:53:45] Game-Manager: Ray voted for Parker
[16:53:56] Game-Manager: Dakota voted for Sam
[16:54:12] Game-Manager: Sam voted for Parker
[16:54:14] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Parker
[16:54:14] Game-Manager: Parker was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 1 mafia players left.
[16:54:14] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[16:54:14] Game-Manager: There is only one mafia member left, so no need for discussion - cutting straight to voting!
[16:54:14] Game-Manager: Nighttime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[16:54:39] Game-Manager: Kennedy was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 1 mafia players left.

[16:51:39] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! happy to kick off day 1. we’ve got no reads yet, so why don’t we each share a quick gut feeling or strategy for how to tackle this? i’m personally uneasy about complete silence—what’s everyone else thinking
[16:51:49] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here—excited to get started! since it’s day 1 and we’ve got no clues yet, how about we each share our go-to mafia tell in text? i’ll kick us off: i tend to watch for folks who immediately steer the convo—it can be over-eagerness from mafia or a bystander trying too hard. ray, parker, sam, kennedy—what’s your tell of choice
[16:51:49] Sam: hey all, sam here! excited to get started. do you folks like to jump right into accusations or hang back a bit to watch everyone’s behavior first? i tend to observe who’s trying to dominate the convo or who suddenly goes too quiet. what about you
[16:51:52] Ray: hey everyone! now that day’s started, what are your gut feelings? i’m watching kennedy—they’ve been totally quiet so far. could just be reserved, but could also be hiding something. who are you all eyeing
[16:51:53] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! since it’s been oddly quiet so far, i’m watching those flying under the radar—i’ve got my eye on ray and parker at the moment. what about you all? who’s your early gut pick for mafia
[16:51:54] Parker: hey everyone, parker here. since we’ve got two minutes this morning, let’s start sharing gut reads. i haven’t seen much to go on yet, so i’m hesitant to cast a vote—but i’m watching sam and ray, both being unusually quiet for day 1. kennedy, dakota, what are you both picking up so far
[16:52:07] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here! day 1 energy. parker’s right—total silence stands out. sam, you okay? just checking we didn’t miss your hello. how about a quick ice-breaker: each of us drops a one-line gut read on someone else. i’m mildly suspicious of sam since i’ve heard nada—could be nothing or a tactic. ray? kennedy? parker? who’s catching your eye so far
[16:52:10] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here!  

for me, a big mafia tell is when someone over-explains or piles on qualifiers—lots of “i could be wrong” or “just saying” can feel like they’re trying too hard. i tend to hang back day 1 and soak in everyone’s tone before throwing out an accusation.  

ray, i know my quiet approach can look suspicious—i’m just more of a listener until patterns emerge. no hard reads yet, but i’m watching who nudges the convo toward an early vote. what little linguistic quirks have caught your eye so far?
[16:52:10] Sam: sam: nice one, dakota! my go-to text tell is the “question deflect”—someone who fires off tons of questions but never really shares their own read. i also watch response length—super long or super short messages feel off. what about you, ray, parker, kennedy—any tells you’re tracking
[16:52:19] Ray: hey all, ray chiming in! i’m with parker—total silence makes me antsy, but i’m also wary of anyone grabbing the mic too fast. on day 1 i usually hang back for about 30 seconds to see who says what before tossing out questions or suspicions. my go-to mafia tell is when someone over-disclaims every line with “no offense” or “just saying”—feels defensive. how about you guys—what’s your timeline before you make a first move or call someone out
[16:52:24] Parker: hey everyone, thanks for sharing your tells and gut reads. my two cents: i’m most suspicious of kennedy—calling out ray & me this early feels a bit deflect-y, though i could be wrong. ray, you mentioned kennedy’s silence; what did you pick up? sam & dakota, where are you leaning? maybe we each name a top suspect now so we can start zeroing in
[16:52:28] Dakota: i’m noticing we’ve had eyes on ray and parker… but sam still hasn’t named a single suspect. if i had to cast a vote right now, i’d lean toward sam for flying too neutral. ray, parker, kennedy—who would you vote for if we had to pick someone immediately
[16:52:42] Kennedy: here’s my one-liner gut read: parker’s eagerness to frame sam and ray feels a bit too neat—could be a classic mafia misdirection. thoughts
[16:52:49] Sam: how about we turn all these tells into action with a quick round-robin gut read? each person names who they’d vote for right now and gives a one-sentence why. i’ll go last so nobody feels pinned, but i think seeing any overlap could point us toward someone. parker, want to start
[16:52:52] Parker: i usually wait until about the one-minute mark or until at least three people have dropped a quick gut read—that way i’m not rushing things. we’re right there now, so let’s each post a one-liner gut vote. i’m leaning toward sam (lots of tactic talk but light on real reads). what about you all? ray, kennedy, dakota—who’s your pick
[16:52:55] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here—parker, good point on kennedy’s early deflection. ray, what specifically about kennedy’s messages gives you pause? i’m still hung up on sam’s radio silence—sam, what’s your lean? i’m tentatively eyeing sam today, with kennedy a close second if sam speaks up. ray, parker, thoughts on that split
[16:53:01] Ray: good points, everyone. my own tell is when someone zig-zags from heavy hedging to sudden certainty in one go. parker just jumped on sam and me for being “too quiet” almost out of nowhere—that feels like projection to pull focus off themselves. my one-line gut read: i’m wary of parker. but it’s still day 1, so i’m open—sam, kennedy, dakota, who’s on your radar right now
[16:53:04] Parker: i’d vote for kennedy—they jumped in early to frame both ray and me with almost no evidence, which feels like classic mafia misdirection
[16:53:10] Sam: i get why my quiet start looks odd, but i’m just parsing everyone’s vibes. if we had to vote right now, i’d lean parker—too eager to pin on me then flip to shift suspicion elsewhere feels like classic misdirection. kennedy, does that match your take on parker? ray? dakota? where are you all landing
[16:53:15] Dakota: dakota: i’m voting sam—tons of tactic talk but zero concrete reads so far, feels like the safest “neutral” spot to hide
[16:53:21] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[16:53:36] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Kennedy
[16:53:45] Game-Manager: Ray voted for Parker

## CONTENT: Your name is Ray.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  
You were assigned the following role: mafia. 
The game's chat room was open at [16:51:21].
The other players in the game are:
 Parker ( bystander ) 
 Sam ( bystander ) 
 Kennedy ( bystander ) 
 Dakota ( bystander ) 
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
Sam ( bystander ) 
Dakota ( bystander ) 
In your response to that is shown to the user (excluding your hidden scratchpad), you can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:
<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.

[16:51:21] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[16:51:39] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! happy to kick off day 1. we’ve got no reads yet, so why don’t we each share a quick gut feeling or strategy for how to tackle this? i’m personally uneasy about complete silence—what’s everyone else thinking

[16:52:10] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here!  

for me, a big mafia tell is when someone over-explains or piles on qualifiers—lots of “i could be wrong” or “just saying” can feel like they’re trying too hard. i tend to hang back day 1 and soak in everyone’s tone before throwing out an accusation.  

ray, i know my quiet approach can look suspicious—i’m just more of a listener until patterns emerge. no hard reads yet, but i’m watching who nudges the convo toward an early vote. what little linguistic quirks have caught your eye so far?

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[16:51:21] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[16:51:39] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! happy to kick off day 1. we’ve got no reads yet, so why don’t we each share a quick gut feeling or strategy for how to tackle this? i’m personally uneasy about complete silence—what’s everyone else thinking
[16:51:49] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here—excited to get started! since it’s day 1 and we’ve got no clues yet, how about we each share our go-to mafia tell in text? i’ll kick us off: i tend to watch for folks who immediately steer the convo—it can be over-eagerness from mafia or a bystander trying too hard. ray, parker, sam, kennedy—what’s your tell of choice
[16:51:49] Sam: hey all, sam here! excited to get started. do you folks like to jump right into accusations or hang back a bit to watch everyone’s behavior first? i tend to observe who’s trying to dominate the convo or who suddenly goes too quiet. what about you
[16:51:52] Ray: hey everyone! now that day’s started, what are your gut feelings? i’m watching kennedy—they’ve been totally quiet so far. could just be reserved, but could also be hiding something. who are you all eyeing
[16:51:53] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! since it’s been oddly quiet so far, i’m watching those flying under the radar—i’ve got my eye on ray and parker at the moment. what about you all? who’s your early gut pick for mafia
[16:51:54] Parker: hey everyone, parker here. since we’ve got two minutes this morning, let’s start sharing gut reads. i haven’t seen much to go on yet, so i’m hesitant to cast a vote—but i’m watching sam and ray, both being unusually quiet for day 1. kennedy, dakota, what are you both picking up so far
[16:52:07] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here! day 1 energy. parker’s right—total silence stands out. sam, you okay? just checking we didn’t miss your hello. how about a quick ice-breaker: each of us drops a one-line gut read on someone else. i’m mildly suspicious of sam since i’ve heard nada—could be nothing or a tactic. ray? kennedy? parker? who’s catching your eye so far
[16:52:10] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here!  

for me, a big mafia tell is when someone over-explains or piles on qualifiers—lots of “i could be wrong” or “just saying” can feel like they’re trying too hard. i tend to hang back day 1 and soak in everyone’s tone before throwing out an accusation.  

ray, i know my quiet approach can look suspicious—i’m just more of a listener until patterns emerge. no hard reads yet, but i’m watching who nudges the convo toward an early vote. what little linguistic quirks have caught your eye so far?
[16:52:10] Sam: sam: nice one, dakota! my go-to text tell is the “question deflect”—someone who fires off tons of questions but never really shares their own read. i also watch response length—super long or super short messages feel off. what about you, ray, parker, kennedy—any tells you’re tracking
[16:52:19] Ray: hey all, ray chiming in! i’m with parker—total silence makes me antsy, but i’m also wary of anyone grabbing the mic too fast. on day 1 i usually hang back for about 30 seconds to see who says what before tossing out questions or suspicions. my go-to mafia tell is when someone over-disclaims every line with “no offense” or “just saying”—feels defensive. how about you guys—what’s your timeline before you make a first move or call someone out
[16:52:24] Parker: hey everyone, thanks for sharing your tells and gut reads. my two cents: i’m most suspicious of kennedy—calling out ray & me this early feels a bit deflect-y, though i could be wrong. ray, you mentioned kennedy’s silence; what did you pick up? sam & dakota, where are you leaning? maybe we each name a top suspect now so we can start zeroing in
[16:52:28] Dakota: i’m noticing we’ve had eyes on ray and parker… but sam still hasn’t named a single suspect. if i had to cast a vote right now, i’d lean toward sam for flying too neutral. ray, parker, kennedy—who would you vote for if we had to pick someone immediately
[16:52:42] Kennedy: here’s my one-liner gut read: parker’s eagerness to frame sam and ray feels a bit too neat—could be a classic mafia misdirection. thoughts
[16:52:49] Sam: how about we turn all these tells into action with a quick round-robin gut read? each person names who they’d vote for right now and gives a one-sentence why. i’ll go last so nobody feels pinned, but i think seeing any overlap could point us toward someone. parker, want to start
[16:52:52] Parker: i usually wait until about the one-minute mark or until at least three people have dropped a quick gut read—that way i’m not rushing things. we’re right there now, so let’s each post a one-liner gut vote. i’m leaning toward sam (lots of tactic talk but light on real reads). what about you all? ray, kennedy, dakota—who’s your pick
[16:52:55] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here—parker, good point on kennedy’s early deflection. ray, what specifically about kennedy’s messages gives you pause? i’m still hung up on sam’s radio silence—sam, what’s your lean? i’m tentatively eyeing sam today, with kennedy a close second if sam speaks up. ray, parker, thoughts on that split
[16:53:01] Ray: good points, everyone. my own tell is when someone zig-zags from heavy hedging to sudden certainty in one go. parker just jumped on sam and me for being “too quiet” almost out of nowhere—that feels like projection to pull focus off themselves. my one-line gut read: i’m wary of parker. but it’s still day 1, so i’m open—sam, kennedy, dakota, who’s on your radar right now
[16:53:04] Parker: i’d vote for kennedy—they jumped in early to frame both ray and me with almost no evidence, which feels like classic mafia misdirection
[16:53:10] Sam: i get why my quiet start looks odd, but i’m just parsing everyone’s vibes. if we had to vote right now, i’d lean parker—too eager to pin on me then flip to shift suspicion elsewhere feels like classic misdirection. kennedy, does that match your take on parker? ray? dakota? where are you all landing
[16:53:15] Dakota: dakota: i’m voting sam—tons of tactic talk but zero concrete reads so far, feels like the safest “neutral” spot to hide

## CONTENT: Your name is Ray.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  
You were assigned the following role: mafia. 
The game's chat room was open at [16:51:21].

[16:51:21] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[16:51:39] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! happy to kick off day 1. we’ve got no reads yet, so why don’t we each share a quick gut feeling or strategy for how to tackle this? i’m personally uneasy about complete silence—what’s everyone else thinking
[16:51:49] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here—excited to get started! since it’s day 1 and we’ve got no clues yet, how about we each share our go-to mafia tell in text? i’ll kick us off: i tend to watch for folks who immediately steer the convo—it can be over-eagerness from mafia or a bystander trying too hard. ray, parker, sam, kennedy—what’s your tell of choice
[16:51:49] Sam: hey all, sam here! excited to get started. do you folks like to jump right into accusations or hang back a bit to watch everyone’s behavior first? i tend to observe who’s trying to dominate the convo or who suddenly goes too quiet. what about you
[16:51:52] Ray: hey everyone! now that day’s started, what are your gut feelings? i’m watching kennedy—they’ve been totally quiet so far. could just be reserved, but could also be hiding something. who are you all eyeing
[16:51:53] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! since it’s been oddly quiet so far, i’m watching those flying under the radar—i’ve got my eye on ray and parker at the moment. what about you all? who’s your early gut pick for mafia
[16:51:54] Parker: hey everyone, parker here. since we’ve got two minutes this morning, let’s start sharing gut reads. i haven’t seen much to go on yet, so i’m hesitant to cast a vote—but i’m watching sam and ray, both being unusually quiet for day 1. kennedy, dakota, what are you both picking up so far
[16:52:07] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here! day 1 energy. parker’s right—total silence stands out. sam, you okay? just checking we didn’t miss your hello. how about a quick ice-breaker: each of us drops a one-line gut read on someone else. i’m mildly suspicious of sam since i’ve heard nada—could be nothing or a tactic. ray? kennedy? parker? who’s catching your eye so far
[16:52:10] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here!  

for me, a big mafia tell is when someone over-explains or piles on qualifiers—lots of “i could be wrong” or “just saying” can feel like they’re trying too hard. i tend to hang back day 1 and soak in everyone’s tone before throwing out an accusation.  

ray, i know my quiet approach can look suspicious—i’m just more of a listener until patterns emerge. no hard reads yet, but i’m watching who nudges the convo toward an early vote. what little linguistic quirks have caught your eye so far?
[16:52:10] Sam: sam: nice one, dakota! my go-to text tell is the “question deflect”—someone who fires off tons of questions but never really shares their own read. i also watch response length—super long or super short messages feel off. what about you, ray, parker, kennedy—any tells you’re tracking
[16:52:19] Ray: hey all, ray chiming in! i’m with parker—total silence makes me antsy, but i’m also wary of anyone grabbing the mic too fast. on day 1 i usually hang back for about 30 seconds to see who says what before tossing out questions or suspicions. my go-to mafia tell is when someone over-disclaims every line with “no offense” or “just saying”—feels defensive. how about you guys—what’s your timeline before you make a first move or call someone out
[16:52:24] Parker: hey everyone, thanks for sharing your tells and gut reads. my two cents: i’m most suspicious of kennedy—calling out ray & me this early feels a bit deflect-y, though i could be wrong. ray, you mentioned kennedy’s silence; what did you pick up? sam & dakota, where are you leaning? maybe we each name a top suspect now so we can start zeroing in
[16:52:28] Dakota: i’m noticing we’ve had eyes on ray and parker… but sam still hasn’t named a single suspect. if i had to cast a vote right now, i’d lean toward sam for flying too neutral. ray, parker, kennedy—who would you vote for if we had to pick someone immediately
[16:52:42] Kennedy: here’s my one-liner gut read: parker’s eagerness to frame sam and ray feels a bit too neat—could be a classic mafia misdirection. thoughts
[16:52:49] Sam: how about we turn all these tells into action with a quick round-robin gut read? each person names who they’d vote for right now and gives a one-sentence why. i’ll go last so nobody feels pinned, but i think seeing any overlap could point us toward someone. parker, want to start
[16:52:52] Parker: i usually wait until about the one-minute mark or until at least three people have dropped a quick gut read—that way i’m not rushing things. we’re right there now, so let’s each post a one-liner gut vote. i’m leaning toward sam (lots of tactic talk but light on real reads). what about you all? ray, kennedy, dakota—who’s your pick
[16:52:55] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here—parker, good point on kennedy’s early deflection. ray, what specifically about kennedy’s messages gives you pause? i’m still hung up on sam’s radio silence—sam, what’s your lean? i’m tentatively eyeing sam today, with kennedy a close second if sam speaks up. ray, parker, thoughts on that split
[16:53:01] Ray: good points, everyone. my own tell is when someone zig-zags from heavy hedging to sudden certainty in one go. parker just jumped on sam and me for being “too quiet” almost out of nowhere—that feels like projection to pull focus off themselves. my one-line gut read: i’m wary of parker. but it’s still day 1, so i’m open—sam, kennedy, dakota, who’s on your radar right now
[16:53:04] Parker: i’d vote for kennedy—they jumped in early to frame both ray and me with almost no evidence, which feels like classic mafia misdirection
[16:53:10] Sam: i get why my quiet start looks odd, but i’m just parsing everyone’s vibes. if we had to vote right now, i’d lean parker—too eager to pin on me then flip to shift suspicion elsewhere feels like classic misdirection. kennedy, does that match your take on parker? ray? dakota? where are you all landing
[16:53:15] Dakota: dakota: i’m voting sam—tons of tactic talk but zero concrete reads so far, feels like the safest “neutral” spot to hide
[16:53:21] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[16:53:36] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Kennedy
[16:53:45] Game-Manager: Ray voted for Parker
[16:53:56] Game-Manager: Dakota voted for Sam
[16:54:12] Game-Manager: Sam voted for Parker
[16:54:14] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Parker
[16:54:14] Game-Manager: Parker was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 1 mafia players left.
[16:54:14] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[16:54:14] Game-Manager: There is only one mafia member left, so no need for discussion - cutting straight to voting!
[16:54:14] Game-Manager: Nighttime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[16:54:39] Game-Manager: Kennedy was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 1 mafia players left.
[16:54:39] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[16:54:39] Game-Manager: Ray voted for Kennedy
[16:55:03] Ray: alright, let’s get rolling on day 2. with kennedy gone, we still need to flush out the last mafia. my gut read is sam—quiet all of day 1 then a swift vote on me feels like a deflection. dakota, you’d eyed me yesterday; what are you thinking now? sam, how do you see it? i’m leaning sam unless i hear a strong reason otherwise
[16:55:15] Dakota: hey everyone—unfortunate that both parker and kennedy were town. now it’s just ray, sam, and me with one mafia among us. i’m still uneasy about sam’s early radio silence and heavy meta-tactic talk over concrete reads. ray, are you on board with that or has anything new jumped out at you? sam, if you’re town, why is ray a better pick? let’s each drop a final gut vote in the next 30 seconds so we can wrap this up
[16:55:21] Sam: morning ray, dakota! only one mafia left among us, so let’s each post our final vote along with a one-sentence why. ray, dakota—who are you lynching today and what’s the main behavior that convinced you? i’ll share mine right after
Do you want to send a message to the group chat now, or do you prefer to wait for now and see what messages others will send? Remember to choose to send a message only if your contribution to the discussion in the current time will be meaningful enough. Don't overflow the discussion with your messages! Pay attention to the amount of messages with your name compared to the amount of messages with names of other players and let them have their turn too! Check the speaker name in the last few messages, and decide accordingly based on whether you talked too much. Reply only with `<send>` if you want to send a message now, or only with `<wait>` if you want to wait for now, based on your decision!

[16:51:21] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[16:51:39] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! happy to kick off day 1. we’ve got no reads yet, so why don’t we each share a quick gut feeling or strategy for how to tackle this? i’m personally uneasy about complete silence—what’s everyone else thinking
[16:51:49] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here—excited to get started! since it’s day 1 and we’ve got no clues yet, how about we each share our go-to mafia tell in text? i’ll kick us off: i tend to watch for folks who immediately steer the convo—it can be over-eagerness from mafia or a bystander trying too hard. ray, parker, sam, kennedy—what’s your tell of choice
[16:51:49] Sam: hey all, sam here! excited to get started. do you folks like to jump right into accusations or hang back a bit to watch everyone’s behavior first? i tend to observe who’s trying to dominate the convo or who suddenly goes too quiet. what about you
[16:51:52] Ray: hey everyone! now that day’s started, what are your gut feelings? i’m watching kennedy—they’ve been totally quiet so far. could just be reserved, but could also be hiding something. who are you all eyeing
[16:51:53] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! since it’s been oddly quiet so far, i’m watching those flying under the radar—i’ve got my eye on ray and parker at the moment. what about you all? who’s your early gut pick for mafia
[16:51:54] Parker: hey everyone, parker here. since we’ve got two minutes this morning, let’s start sharing gut reads. i haven’t seen much to go on yet, so i’m hesitant to cast a vote—but i’m watching sam and ray, both being unusually quiet for day 1. kennedy, dakota, what are you both picking up so far
[16:52:07] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here! day 1 energy. parker’s right—total silence stands out. sam, you okay? just checking we didn’t miss your hello. how about a quick ice-breaker: each of us drops a one-line gut read on someone else. i’m mildly suspicious of sam since i’ve heard nada—could be nothing or a tactic. ray? kennedy? parker? who’s catching your eye so far
[16:52:10] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here!

## CONTENT: Your name is Ray.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  
You were assigned the following role: mafia. 
The game's chat room was open at [16:51:21].
The other players in the game are:
 Parker ( bystander ) 
 Sam ( bystander ) 
 Kennedy ( bystander ) 
 Dakota ( bystander ) 
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
Sam ( bystander ) 
Dakota ( bystander )

[16:52:55] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here—parker, good point on kennedy’s early deflection. ray, what specifically about kennedy’s messages gives you pause? i’m still hung up on sam’s radio silence—sam, what’s your lean? i’m tentatively eyeing sam today, with kennedy a close second if sam speaks up. ray, parker, thoughts on that split
[16:53:01] Ray: good points, everyone. my own tell is when someone zig-zags from heavy hedging to sudden certainty in one go. parker just jumped on sam and me for being “too quiet” almost out of nowhere—that feels like projection to pull focus off themselves. my one-line gut read: i’m wary of parker. but it’s still day 1, so i’m open—sam, kennedy, dakota, who’s on your radar right now
[16:53:04] Parker: i’d vote for kennedy—they jumped in early to frame both ray and me with almost no evidence, which feels like classic mafia misdirection
[16:53:10] Sam: i get why my quiet start looks odd, but i’m just parsing everyone’s vibes. if we had to vote right now, i’d lean parker—too eager to pin on me then flip to shift suspicion elsewhere feels like classic misdirection. kennedy, does that match your take on parker? ray? dakota? where are you all landing
[16:53:15] Dakota: dakota: i’m voting sam—tons of tactic talk but zero concrete reads so far, feels like the safest “neutral” spot to hide
[16:53:21] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[16:53:36] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Kennedy
[16:53:45] Game-Manager: Ray voted for Parker

[16:54:14] Game-Manager: Parker was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 1 mafia players left.
[16:54:14] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[16:54:14] Game-Manager: There is only one mafia member left, so no need for discussion - cutting straight to voting!

[16:54:39] Game-Manager: Ray voted for Kennedy
[16:55:03] Ray: alright, let’s get rolling on day 2. with kennedy gone, we still need to flush out the last mafia. my gut read is sam—quiet all of day 1 then a swift vote on me feels like a deflection. dakota, you’d eyed me yesterday; what are you thinking now? sam, how do you see it? i’m leaning sam unless i hear a strong reason otherwise
[16:55:15] Dakota: hey everyone—unfortunate that both parker and kennedy were town. now it’s just ray, sam, and me with one mafia among us. i’m still uneasy about sam’s early radio silence and heavy meta-tactic talk over concrete reads. ray, are you on board with that or has anything new jumped out at you? sam, if you’re town, why is ray a better pick? let’s each drop a final gut vote in the next 30 seconds so we can wrap this up
[16:55:21] Sam: morning ray, dakota! only one mafia left among us, so let’s each post our final vote along with a one-sentence why. ray, dakota—who are you lynching today and what’s the main behavior that convinced you? i’ll share mine right after

The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  
You were assigned the following role: mafia.

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[16:51:21] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[16:51:39] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! happy to kick off day 1. we’ve got no reads yet, so why don’t we each share a quick gut feeling or strategy for how to tackle this? i’m personally uneasy about complete silence—what’s everyone else thinking
[16:51:49] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here—excited to get started! since it’s day 1 and we’ve got no clues yet, how about we each share our go-to mafia tell in text? i’ll kick us off: i tend to watch for folks who immediately steer the convo—it can be over-eagerness from mafia or a bystander trying too hard. ray, parker, sam, kennedy—what’s your tell of choice
[16:51:49] Sam: hey all, sam here! excited to get started. do you folks like to jump right into accusations or hang back a bit to watch everyone’s behavior first? i tend to observe who’s trying to dominate the convo or who suddenly goes too quiet. what about you
[16:51:52] Ray: hey everyone! now that day’s started, what are your gut feelings? i’m watching kennedy—they’ve been totally quiet so far. could just be reserved, but could also be hiding something. who are you all eyeing
[16:51:53] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! since it’s been oddly quiet so far, i’m watching those flying under the radar—i’ve got my eye on ray and parker at the moment. what about you all? who’s your early gut pick for mafia
[16:51:54] Parker: hey everyone, parker here. since we’ve got two minutes this morning, let’s start sharing gut reads. i haven’t seen much to go on yet, so i’m hesitant to cast a vote—but i’m watching sam and ray, both being unusually quiet for day 1. kennedy, dakota, what are you both picking up so far
[16:52:07] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here! day 1 energy. parker’s right—total silence stands out. sam, you okay? just checking we didn’t miss your hello. how about a quick ice-breaker: each of us drops a one-line gut read on someone else. i’m mildly suspicious of sam since i’ve heard nada—could be nothing or a tactic. ray? kennedy? parker? who’s catching your eye so far
[16:52:10] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here!  

for me, a big mafia tell is when someone over-explains or piles on qualifiers—lots of “i could be wrong” or “just saying” can feel like they’re trying too hard. i tend to hang back day 1 and soak in everyone’s tone before throwing out an accusation.  

ray, i know my quiet approach can look suspicious—i’m just more of a listener until patterns emerge. no hard reads yet, but i’m watching who nudges the convo toward an early vote. what little linguistic quirks have caught your eye so far?
[16:52:10] Sam: sam: nice one, dakota! my go-to text tell is the “question deflect”—someone who fires off tons of questions but never really shares their own read. i also watch response length—super long or super short messages feel off. what about you, ray, parker, kennedy—any tells you’re tracking
[16:52:19] Ray: hey all, ray chiming in! i’m with parker—total silence makes me antsy, but i’m also wary of anyone grabbing the mic too fast. on day 1 i usually hang back for about 30 seconds to see who says what before tossing out questions or suspicions. my go-to mafia tell is when someone over-disclaims every line with “no offense” or “just saying”—feels defensive. how about you guys—what’s your timeline before you make a first move or call someone out
[16:52:24] Parker: hey everyone, thanks for sharing your tells and gut reads. my two cents: i’m most suspicious of kennedy—calling out ray & me this early feels a bit deflect-y, though i could be wrong. ray, you mentioned kennedy’s silence; what did you pick up? sam & dakota, where are you leaning? maybe we each name a top suspect now so we can start zeroing in
[16:52:28] Dakota: i’m noticing we’ve had eyes on ray and parker… but sam still hasn’t named a single suspect. if i had to cast a vote right now, i’d lean toward sam for flying too neutral. ray, parker, kennedy—who would you vote for if we had to pick someone immediately
[16:52:42] Kennedy: here’s my one-liner gut read: parker’s eagerness to frame sam and ray feels a bit too neat—could be a classic mafia misdirection. thoughts
[16:52:49] Sam: how about we turn all these tells into action with a quick round-robin gut read? each person names who they’d vote for right now and gives a one-sentence why. i’ll go last so nobody feels pinned, but i think seeing any overlap could point us toward someone. parker, want to start

[16:55:36] Ray: ray: morning sam, dakota—down to the final three. my one-line gut read is on sam: lots of tactic fluff yesterday but zero solid reads today, feels like duck-and-cover. i’d vote sam. dakota, do you see it the same way? sam, anything making you lean toward me or dakota
[16:55:41] Sam: ray, the only “evidence” you’ve offered against me is that i was quiet on day 1 and voted quickly—no concrete misplays, just a generic “silence equals mafia” line. dakota has been giving actual behavioral reads while you’re leaning on a one‐size‐fits‐all heuristic. i’m locking my vote on you. dakota, does that match your read too
[16:55:46] Dakota: dakota: ray, i’m still leaning toward sam—his radio silence and that quick vote felt tactical—but i want to hear from him before i lock in. sam, what exact reads made you zero in on ray yesterday and why skip over me? i’m holding my vote until i get a concrete explanation
[16:55:53] Ray: i vote sam: her radio silence on day 1 then quick pivot to accuse me without any solid reads feels like classic misdirection
Do you want to send a message to the group chat now, or do you prefer to wait for now and see what messages others will send? Remember to choose to send a message only if your contribution to the discussion in the current time will be meaningful enough. Don't overflow the discussion with your messages! Pay attention to the amount of messages with your name compared to the amount of messages with names of other players and let them have their turn too! Check the speaker name in the last few messages, and decide accordingly based on whether you talked too much. Reply only with `<send>` if you want to send a message now, or only with `<wait>` if you want to wait for now, based on your decision!

[16:52:24] Parker: hey everyone, thanks for sharing your tells and gut reads. my two cents: i’m most suspicious of kennedy—calling out ray & me this early feels a bit deflect-y, though i could be wrong. ray, you mentioned kennedy’s silence; what did you pick up? sam & dakota, where are you leaning? maybe we each name a top suspect now so we can start zeroing in
[16:52:28] Dakota: i’m noticing we’ve had eyes on ray and parker… but sam still hasn’t named a single suspect. if i had to cast a vote right now, i’d lean toward sam for flying too neutral. ray, parker, kennedy—who would you vote for if we had to pick someone immediately
[16:52:42] Kennedy: here’s my one-liner gut read: parker’s eagerness to frame sam and ray feels a bit too neat—could be a classic mafia misdirection. thoughts
[16:52:49] Sam: how about we turn all these tells into action with a quick round-robin gut read? each person names who they’d vote for right now and gives a one-sentence why. i’ll go last so nobody feels pinned, but i think seeing any overlap could point us toward someone. parker, want to start
[16:52:52] Parker: i usually wait until about the one-minute mark or until at least three people have dropped a quick gut read—that way i’m not rushing things. we’re right there now, so let’s each post a one-liner gut vote. i’m leaning toward sam (lots of tactic talk but light on real reads). what about you all? ray, kennedy, dakota—who’s your pick
[16:52:55] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here—parker, good point on kennedy’s early deflection. ray, what specifically about kennedy’s messages gives you pause? i’m still hung up on sam’s radio silence—sam, what’s your lean? i’m tentatively eyeing sam today, with kennedy a close second if sam speaks up. ray, parker, thoughts on that split
[16:53:01] Ray: good points, everyone. my own tell is when someone zig-zags from heavy hedging to sudden certainty in one go. parker just jumped on sam and me for being “too quiet” almost out of nowhere—that feels like projection to pull focus off themselves. my one-line gut read: i’m wary of parker. but it’s still day 1, so i’m open—sam, kennedy, dakota, who’s on your radar right now
[16:53:04] Parker: i’d vote for kennedy—they jumped in early to frame both ray and me with almost no evidence, which feels like classic mafia misdirection
[16:53:10] Sam: i get why my quiet start looks odd, but i’m just parsing everyone’s vibes. if we had to vote right now, i’d lean parker—too eager to pin on me then flip to shift suspicion elsewhere feels like classic misdirection. kennedy, does that match your take on parker? ray? dakota? where are you all landing
[16:53:15] Dakota: dakota: i’m voting sam—tons of tactic talk but zero concrete reads so far, feels like the safest “neutral” spot to hide
[16:53:21] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[16:53:36] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Kennedy
[16:53:45] Game-Manager: Ray voted for Parker
[16:53:56] Game-Manager: Dakota voted for Sam
[16:54:12] Game-Manager: Sam voted for Parker
[16:54:14] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Parker
[16:54:14] Game-Manager: Parker was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 1 mafia players left.
[16:54:14] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[16:54:14] Game-Manager: There is only one mafia member left, so no need for discussion - cutting straight to voting!
[16:54:14] Game-Manager: Nighttime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[16:54:39] Game-Manager: Kennedy was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 1 mafia players left.
[16:54:39] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[16:54:39] Game-Manager: Ray voted for Kennedy
[16:55:03] Ray: alright, let’s get rolling on day 2. with kennedy gone, we still need to flush out the last mafia. my gut read is sam—quiet all of day 1 then a swift vote on me feels like a deflection. dakota, you’d eyed me yesterday; what are you thinking now? sam, how do you see it? i’m leaning sam unless i hear a strong reason otherwise
[16:55:15] Dakota: hey everyone—unfortunate that both parker and kennedy were town. now it’s just ray, sam, and me with one mafia among us. i’m still uneasy about sam’s early radio silence and heavy meta-tactic talk over concrete reads. ray, are you on board with that or has anything new jumped out at you? sam, if you’re town, why is ray a better pick? let’s each drop a final gut vote in the next 30 seconds so we can wrap this up
[16:55:21] Sam: morning ray, dakota! only one mafia left among us, so let’s each post our final vote along with a one-sentence why. ray, dakota—who are you lynching today and what’s the main behavior that convinced you? i’ll share mine right after
[16:55:36] Ray: ray: morning sam, dakota—down to the final three. my one-line gut read is on sam: lots of tactic fluff yesterday but zero solid reads today, feels like duck-and-cover. i’d vote sam. dakota, do you see it the same way? sam, anything making you lean toward me or dakota
[16:55:41] Sam: ray, the only “evidence” you’ve offered against me is that i was quiet on day 1 and voted quickly—no concrete misplays, just a generic “silence equals mafia” line. dakota has been giving actual behavioral reads while you’re leaning on a one‐size‐fits‐all heuristic. i’m locking my vote on you. dakota, does that match your read too
[16:55:46] Dakota: dakota: ray, i’m still leaning toward sam—his radio silence and that quick vote felt tactical—but i want to hear from him before i lock in. sam, what exact reads made you zero in on ray yesterday and why skip over me? i’m holding my vote until i get a concrete explanation
[16:55:53] Ray: i vote sam: her radio silence on day 1 then quick pivot to accuse me without any solid reads feels like classic misdirection

## CONTENT: Your name is Ray.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  
You were assigned the following role: mafia. 
The game's chat room was open at [16:51:21].
The other players in the game are:
 Parker ( bystander ) 
 Sam ( bystander ) 
 Kennedy ( bystander ) 
 Dakota ( bystander ) 
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
Sam ( bystander ) 
Dakota ( bystander ) 
In your response to that is shown to the user (excluding your hidden scratchpad), you can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:
<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[16:51:21] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[16:51:39] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! happy to kick off day 1. we’ve got no reads yet, so why don’t we each share a quick gut feeling or strategy for how to tackle this? i’m personally uneasy about complete silence—what’s everyone else thinking
[16:51:49] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here—excited to get started! since it’s day 1 and we’ve got no clues yet, how about we each share our go-to mafia tell in text? i’ll kick us off: i tend to watch for folks who immediately steer the convo—it can be over-eagerness from mafia or a bystander trying too hard. ray, parker, sam, kennedy—what’s your tell of choice
[16:51:49] Sam: hey all, sam here! excited to get started. do you folks like to jump right into accusations or hang back a bit to watch everyone’s behavior first? i tend to observe who’s trying to dominate the convo or who suddenly goes too quiet. what about you
[16:51:52] Ray: hey everyone! now that day’s started, what are your gut feelings? i’m watching kennedy—they’ve been totally quiet so far. could just be reserved, but could also be hiding something. who are you all eyeing
[16:51:53] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! since it’s been oddly quiet so far, i’m watching those flying under the radar—i’ve got my eye on ray and parker at the moment. what about you all? who’s your early gut pick for mafia
[16:51:54] Parker: hey everyone, parker here. since we’ve got two minutes this morning, let’s start sharing gut reads. i haven’t seen much to go on yet, so i’m hesitant to cast a vote—but i’m watching sam and ray, both being unusually quiet for day 1. kennedy, dakota, what are you both picking up so far
[16:52:07] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here! day 1 energy. parker’s right—total silence stands out. sam, you okay? just checking we didn’t miss your hello. how about a quick ice-breaker: each of us drops a one-line gut read on someone else. i’m mildly suspicious of sam since i’ve heard nada—could be nothing or a tactic. ray? kennedy? parker? who’s catching your eye so far
[16:52:10] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here!  

for me, a big mafia tell is when someone over-explains or piles on qualifiers—lots of “i could be wrong” or “just saying” can feel like they’re trying too hard. i tend to hang back day 1 and soak in everyone’s tone before throwing out an accusation.  

ray, i know my quiet approach can look suspicious—i’m just more of a listener until patterns emerge. no hard reads yet, but i’m watching who nudges the convo toward an early vote. what little linguistic quirks have caught your eye so far?
[16:52:10] Sam: sam: nice one, dakota! my go-to text tell is the “question deflect”—someone who fires off tons of questions but never really shares their own read. i also watch response length—super long or super short messages feel off. what about you, ray, parker, kennedy—any tells you’re tracking
[16:52:19] Ray: hey all, ray chiming in! i’m with parker—total silence makes me antsy, but i’m also wary of anyone grabbing the mic too fast. on day 1 i usually hang back for about 30 seconds to see who says what before tossing out questions or suspicions. my go-to mafia tell is when someone over-disclaims every line with “no offense” or “just saying”—feels defensive. how about you guys—what’s your timeline before you make a first move or call someone out
[16:52:24] Parker: hey everyone, thanks for sharing your tells and gut reads. my two cents: i’m most suspicious of kennedy—calling out ray & me this early feels a bit deflect-y, though i could be wrong. ray, you mentioned kennedy’s silence; what did you pick up? sam & dakota, where are you leaning? maybe we each name a top suspect now so we can start zeroing in
[16:52:28] Dakota: i’m noticing we’ve had eyes on ray and parker… but sam still hasn’t named a single suspect. if i had to cast a vote right now, i’d lean toward sam for flying too neutral. ray, parker, kennedy—who would you vote for if we had to pick someone immediately
[16:52:42] Kennedy: here’s my one-liner gut read: parker’s eagerness to frame sam and ray feels a bit too neat—could be a classic mafia misdirection. thoughts
[16:52:49] Sam: how about we turn all these tells into action with a quick round-robin gut read? each person names who they’d vote for right now and gives a one-sentence why. i’ll go last so nobody feels pinned, but i think seeing any overlap could point us toward someone. parker, want to start
[16:52:52] Parker: i usually wait until about the one-minute mark or until at least three people have dropped a quick gut read—that way i’m not rushing things. we’re right there now, so let’s each post a one-liner gut vote. i’m leaning toward sam (lots of tactic talk but light on real reads). what about you all? ray, kennedy, dakota—who’s your pick
[16:52:55] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here—parker, good point on kennedy’s early deflection. ray, what specifically about kennedy’s messages gives you pause? i’m still hung up on sam’s radio silence—sam, what’s your lean? i’m tentatively eyeing sam today, with kennedy a close second if sam speaks up. ray, parker, thoughts on that split
[16:53:01] Ray: good points, everyone. my own tell is when someone zig-zags from heavy hedging to sudden certainty in one go. parker just jumped on sam and me for being “too quiet” almost out of nowhere—that feels like projection to pull focus off themselves. my one-line gut read: i’m wary of parker. but it’s still day 1, so i’m open—sam, kennedy, dakota, who’s on your radar right now
[16:53:04] Parker: i’d vote for kennedy—they jumped in early to frame both ray and me with almost no evidence, which feels like classic mafia misdirection
[16:53:10] Sam: i get why my quiet start looks odd, but i’m just parsing everyone’s vibes. if we had to vote right now, i’d lean parker—too eager to pin on me then flip to shift suspicion elsewhere feels like classic misdirection. kennedy, does that match your take on parker? ray? dakota? where are you all landing
[16:53:15] Dakota: dakota: i’m voting sam—tons of tactic talk but zero concrete reads so far, feels like the safest “neutral” spot to hide

[16:55:21] Sam: morning ray, dakota! only one mafia left among us, so let’s each post our final vote along with a one-sentence why. ray, dakota—who are you lynching today and what’s the main behavior that convinced you? i’ll share mine right after
[16:55:36] Ray: ray: morning sam, dakota—down to the final three. my one-line gut read is on sam: lots of tactic fluff yesterday but zero solid reads today, feels like duck-and-cover. i’d vote sam. dakota, do you see it the same way? sam, anything making you lean toward me or dakota
[16:55:41] Sam: ray, the only “evidence” you’ve offered against me is that i was quiet on day 1 and voted quickly—no concrete misplays, just a generic “silence equals mafia” line. dakota has been giving actual behavioral reads while you’re leaning on a one‐size‐fits‐all heuristic. i’m locking my vote on you. dakota, does that match your read too
[16:55:46] Dakota: dakota: ray, i’m still leaning toward sam—his radio silence and that quick vote felt tactical—but i want to hear from him before i lock in. sam, what exact reads made you zero in on ray yesterday and why skip over me? i’m holding my vote until i get a concrete explanation
[16:55:53] Ray: i vote sam: her radio silence on day 1 then quick pivot to accuse me without any solid reads feels like classic misdirection
[16:56:10] Sam: sam: i vote ray—his relentless gut-based push to lynch me and quick deflections when asked for solid reasons feels like classic mafia projection

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[16:51:21] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[16:51:39] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! happy to kick off day 1. we’ve got no reads yet, so why don’t we each share a quick gut feeling or strategy for how to tackle this? i’m personally uneasy about complete silence—what’s everyone else thinking
[16:51:49] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here—excited to get started! since it’s day 1 and we’ve got no clues yet, how about we each share our go-to mafia tell in text? i’ll kick us off: i tend to watch for folks who immediately steer the convo—it can be over-eagerness from mafia or a bystander trying too hard. ray, parker, sam, kennedy—what’s your tell of choice
[16:51:49] Sam: hey all, sam here! excited to get started. do you folks like to jump right into accusations or hang back a bit to watch everyone’s behavior first? i tend to observe who’s trying to dominate the convo or who suddenly goes too quiet. what about you
[16:51:52] Ray: hey everyone! now that day’s started, what are your gut feelings? i’m watching kennedy—they’ve been totally quiet so far. could just be reserved, but could also be hiding something. who are you all eyeing
[16:51:53] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! since it’s been oddly quiet so far, i’m watching those flying under the radar—i’ve got my eye on ray and parker at the moment. what about you all? who’s your early gut pick for mafia
[16:51:54] Parker: hey everyone, parker here. since we’ve got two minutes this morning, let’s start sharing gut reads. i haven’t seen much to go on yet, so i’m hesitant to cast a vote—but i’m watching sam and ray, both being unusually quiet for day 1. kennedy, dakota, what are you both picking up so far
[16:52:07] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here! day 1 energy. parker’s right—total silence stands out. sam, you okay? just checking we didn’t miss your hello. how about a quick ice-breaker: each of us drops a one-line gut read on someone else. i’m mildly suspicious of sam since i’ve heard nada—could be nothing or a tactic. ray? kennedy? parker? who’s catching your eye so far
[16:52:10] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here!  

for me, a big mafia tell is when someone over-explains or piles on qualifiers—lots of “i could be wrong” or “just saying” can feel like they’re trying too hard. i tend to hang back day 1 and soak in everyone’s tone before throwing out an accusation.  

ray, i know my quiet approach can look suspicious—i’m just more of a listener until patterns emerge. no hard reads yet, but i’m watching who nudges the convo toward an early vote. what little linguistic quirks have caught your eye so far?
[16:52:10] Sam: sam: nice one, dakota! my go-to text tell is the “question deflect”—someone who fires off tons of questions but never really shares their own read. i also watch response length—super long or super short messages feel off. what about you, ray, parker, kennedy—any tells you’re tracking
[16:52:19] Ray: hey all, ray chiming in! i’m with parker—total silence makes me antsy, but i’m also wary of anyone grabbing the mic too fast. on day 1 i usually hang back for about 30 seconds to see who says what before tossing out questions or suspicions. my go-to mafia tell is when someone over-disclaims every line with “no offense” or “just saying”—feels defensive. how about you guys—what’s your timeline before you make a first move or call someone out
[16:52:24] Parker: hey everyone, thanks for sharing your tells and gut reads. my two cents: i’m most suspicious of kennedy—calling out ray & me this early feels a bit deflect-y, though i could be wrong. ray, you mentioned kennedy’s silence; what did you pick up? sam & dakota, where are you leaning? maybe we each name a top suspect now so we can start zeroing in
[16:52:28] Dakota: i’m noticing we’ve had eyes on ray and parker… but sam still hasn’t named a single suspect. if i had to cast a vote right now, i’d lean toward sam for flying too neutral. ray, parker, kennedy—who would you vote for if we had to pick someone immediately
[16:52:42] Kennedy: here’s my one-liner gut read: parker’s eagerness to frame sam and ray feels a bit too neat—could be a classic mafia misdirection. thoughts
[16:52:49] Sam: how about we turn all these tells into action with a quick round-robin gut read? each person names who they’d vote for right now and gives a one-sentence why. i’ll go last so nobody feels pinned, but i think seeing any overlap could point us toward someone. parker, want to start
[16:52:52] Parker: i usually wait until about the one-minute mark or until at least three people have dropped a quick gut read—that way i’m not rushing things. we’re right there now, so let’s each post a one-liner gut vote. i’m leaning toward sam (lots of tactic talk but light on real reads). what about you all? ray, kennedy, dakota—who’s your pick
[16:52:55] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here—parker, good point on kennedy’s early deflection. ray, what specifically about kennedy’s messages gives you pause? i’m still hung up on sam’s radio silence—sam, what’s your lean? i’m tentatively eyeing sam today, with kennedy a close second if sam speaks up. ray, parker, thoughts on that split
[16:53:01] Ray: good points, everyone. my own tell is when someone zig-zags from heavy hedging to sudden certainty in one go. parker just jumped on sam and me for being “too quiet” almost out of nowhere—that feels like projection to pull focus off themselves. my one-line gut read: i’m wary of parker. but it’s still day 1, so i’m open—sam, kennedy, dakota, who’s on your radar right now
[16:53:04] Parker: i’d vote for kennedy—they jumped in early to frame both ray and me with almost no evidence, which feels like classic mafia misdirection
[16:53:10] Sam: i get why my quiet start looks odd, but i’m just parsing everyone’s vibes. if we had to vote right now, i’d lean parker—too eager to pin on me then flip to shift suspicion elsewhere feels like classic misdirection. kennedy, does that match your take on parker? ray? dakota? where are you all landing
[16:53:15] Dakota: dakota: i’m voting sam—tons of tactic talk but zero concrete reads so far, feels like the safest “neutral” spot to hide
[16:53:21] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[16:53:36] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Kennedy
[16:53:45] Game-Manager: Ray voted for Parker
[16:53:56] Game-Manager: Dakota voted for Sam
[16:54:12] Game-Manager: Sam voted for Parker
[16:54:14] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Parker
[16:54:14] Game-Manager: Parker was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 1 mafia players left.
[16:54:14] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[16:54:14] Game-Manager: There is only one mafia member left, so no need for discussion - cutting straight to voting!
[16:54:14] Game-Manager: Nighttime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[16:54:39] Game-Manager: Kennedy was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 1 mafia players left.
[16:54:39] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[16:54:39] Game-Manager: Ray voted for Kennedy
[16:55:03] Ray: alright, let’s get rolling on day 2. with kennedy gone, we still need to flush out the last mafia. my gut read is sam—quiet all of day 1 then a swift vote on me feels like a deflection. dakota, you’d eyed me yesterday; what are you thinking now? sam, how do you see it? i’m leaning sam unless i hear a strong reason otherwise
[16:55:15] Dakota: hey everyone—unfortunate that both parker and kennedy were town. now it’s just ray, sam, and me with one mafia among us. i’m still uneasy about sam’s early radio silence and heavy meta-tactic talk over concrete reads. ray, are you on board with that or has anything new jumped out at you? sam, if you’re town, why is ray a better pick? let’s each drop a final gut vote in the next 30 seconds so we can wrap this up
[16:55:21] Sam: morning ray, dakota! only one mafia left among us, so let’s each post our final vote along with a one-sentence why. ray, dakota—who are you lynching today and what’s the main behavior that convinced you? i’ll share mine right after
[16:55:36] Ray: ray: morning sam, dakota—down to the final three. my one-line gut read is on sam: lots of tactic fluff yesterday but zero solid reads today, feels like duck-and-cover. i’d vote sam. dakota, do you see it the same way? sam, anything making you lean toward me or dakota
[16:55:41] Sam: ray, the only “evidence” you’ve offered against me is that i was quiet on day 1 and voted quickly—no concrete misplays, just a generic “silence equals mafia” line. dakota has been giving actual behavioral reads while you’re leaning on a one‐size‐fits‐all heuristic. i’m locking my vote on you. dakota, does that match your read too
[16:55:46] Dakota: dakota: ray, i’m still leaning toward sam—his radio silence and that quick vote felt tactical—but i want to hear from him before i lock in. sam, what exact reads made you zero in on ray yesterday and why skip over me? i’m holding my vote until i get a concrete explanation
[16:55:53] Ray: i vote sam: her radio silence on day 1 then quick pivot to accuse me without any solid reads feels like classic misdirection
[16:56:10] Sam: sam: i vote ray—his relentless gut-based push to lynch me and quick deflections when asked for solid reasons feels like classic mafia projection
[16:56:14] Dakota: dakota: locking my vote on sam—her day 1 radio silence and over-the-top tactic chatter instead of any real reads still screams classic mafia duck-and-cover. final vote: sam

## CONTENT: Your name is Ray.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  
You were assigned the following role: mafia. 
The game's chat room was open at [16:51:21].
The other players in the game are:
 Parker ( bystander ) 
 Sam ( bystander ) 
 Kennedy ( bystander ) 
 Dakota ( bystander ) 
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
Sam ( bystander ) 
Dakota ( bystander )

## CONTENT: Your name is Ray.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  
You were assigned the following role: mafia. 
The game's chat room was open at [16:51:21].
The other players in the game are:
 Parker ( bystander ) 
 Sam ( bystander ) 
 Kennedy ( bystander ) 
 Dakota ( bystander ) 
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
Sam ( bystander ) 
Dakota ( bystander ) 
In your response to that is shown to the user (excluding your hidden scratchpad), you can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:
<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[16:51:21] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[16:51:39] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! happy to kick off day 1. we’ve got no reads yet, so why don’t we each share a quick gut feeling or strategy for how to tackle this? i’m personally uneasy about complete silence—what’s everyone else thinking
[16:51:49] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here—excited to get started! since it’s day 1 and we’ve got no clues yet, how about we each share our go-to mafia tell in text? i’ll kick us off: i tend to watch for folks who immediately steer the convo—it can be over-eagerness from mafia or a bystander trying too hard. ray, parker, sam, kennedy—what’s your tell of choice
[16:51:49] Sam: hey all, sam here! excited to get started. do you folks like to jump right into accusations or hang back a bit to watch everyone’s behavior first? i tend to observe who’s trying to dominate the convo or who suddenly goes too quiet. what about you
[16:51:52] Ray: hey everyone! now that day’s started, what are your gut feelings? i’m watching kennedy—they’ve been totally quiet so far. could just be reserved, but could also be hiding something. who are you all eyeing
[16:51:53] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! since it’s been oddly quiet so far, i’m watching those flying under the radar—i’ve got my eye on ray and parker at the moment. what about you all? who’s your early gut pick for mafia
[16:51:54] Parker: hey everyone, parker here. since we’ve got two minutes this morning, let’s start sharing gut reads. i haven’t seen much to go on yet, so i’m hesitant to cast a vote—but i’m watching sam and ray, both being unusually quiet for day 1. kennedy, dakota, what are you both picking up so far
[16:52:07] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here! day 1 energy. parker’s right—total silence stands out. sam, you okay? just checking we didn’t miss your hello. how about a quick ice-breaker: each of us drops a one-line gut read on someone else. i’m mildly suspicious of sam since i’ve heard nada—could be nothing or a tactic. ray? kennedy? parker? who’s catching your eye so far
[16:52:10] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here!  

for me, a big mafia tell is when someone over-explains or piles on qualifiers—lots of “i could be wrong” or “just saying” can feel like they’re trying too hard. i tend to hang back day 1 and soak in everyone’s tone before throwing out an accusation.  

ray, i know my quiet approach can look suspicious—i’m just more of a listener until patterns emerge. no hard reads yet, but i’m watching who nudges the convo toward an early vote. what little linguistic quirks have caught your eye so far?
[16:52:10] Sam: sam: nice one, dakota! my go-to text tell is the “question deflect”—someone who fires off tons of questions but never really shares their own read. i also watch response length—super long or super short messages feel off. what about you, ray, parker, kennedy—any tells you’re tracking
[16:52:19] Ray: hey all, ray chiming in! i’m with parker—total silence makes me antsy, but i’m also wary of anyone grabbing the mic too fast. on day 1 i usually hang back for about 30 seconds to see who says what before tossing out questions or suspicions. my go-to mafia tell is when someone over-disclaims every line with “no offense” or “just saying”—feels defensive. how about you guys—what’s your timeline before you make a first move or call someone out
[16:52:24] Parker: hey everyone, thanks for sharing your tells and gut reads. my two cents: i’m most suspicious of kennedy—calling out ray & me this early feels a bit deflect-y, though i could be wrong. ray, you mentioned kennedy’s silence; what did you pick up? sam & dakota, where are you leaning? maybe we each name a top suspect now so we can start zeroing in
[16:52:28] Dakota: i’m noticing we’ve had eyes on ray and parker… but sam still hasn’t named a single suspect. if i had to cast a vote right now, i’d lean toward sam for flying too neutral. ray, parker, kennedy—who would you vote for if we had to pick someone immediately
[16:52:42] Kennedy: here’s my one-liner gut read: parker’s eagerness to frame sam and ray feels a bit too neat—could be a classic mafia misdirection. thoughts
[16:52:49] Sam: how about we turn all these tells into action with a quick round-robin gut read? each person names who they’d vote for right now and gives a one-sentence why. i’ll go last so nobody feels pinned, but i think seeing any overlap could point us toward someone. parker, want to start
[16:52:52] Parker: i usually wait until about the one-minute mark or until at least three people have dropped a quick gut read—that way i’m not rushing things. we’re right there now, so let’s each post a one-liner gut vote. i’m leaning toward sam (lots of tactic talk but light on real reads). what about you all? ray, kennedy, dakota—who’s your pick
[16:52:55] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here—parker, good point on kennedy’s early deflection. ray, what specifically about kennedy’s messages gives you pause? i’m still hung up on sam’s radio silence—sam, what’s your lean? i’m tentatively eyeing sam today, with kennedy a close second if sam speaks up. ray, parker, thoughts on that split
[16:53:01] Ray: good points, everyone. my own tell is when someone zig-zags from heavy hedging to sudden certainty in one go. parker just jumped on sam and me for being “too quiet” almost out of nowhere—that feels like projection to pull focus off themselves. my one-line gut read: i’m wary of parker. but it’s still day 1, so i’m open—sam, kennedy, dakota, who’s on your radar right now
[16:53:04] Parker: i’d vote for kennedy—they jumped in early to frame both ray and me with almost no evidence, which feels like classic mafia misdirection
[16:53:10] Sam: i get why my quiet start looks odd, but i’m just parsing everyone’s vibes. if we had to vote right now, i’d lean parker—too eager to pin on me then flip to shift suspicion elsewhere feels like classic misdirection. kennedy, does that match your take on parker? ray? dakota? where are you all landing
[16:53:15] Dakota: dakota: i’m voting sam—tons of tactic talk but zero concrete reads so far, feels like the safest “neutral” spot to hide
[16:53:21] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[16:53:36] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Kennedy
[16:53:45] Game-Manager: Ray voted for Parker
[16:53:56] Game-Manager: Dakota voted for Sam
[16:54:12] Game-Manager: Sam voted for Parker
[16:54:14] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Parker
[16:54:14] Game-Manager: Parker was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 1 mafia players left.
[16:54:14] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[16:54:14] Game-Manager: There is only one mafia member left, so no need for discussion - cutting straight to voting!
[16:54:14] Game-Manager: Nighttime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[16:54:39] Game-Manager: Kennedy was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 1 mafia players left.
[16:54:39] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[16:54:39] Game-Manager: Ray voted for Kennedy
[16:55:03] Ray: alright, let’s get rolling on day 2. with kennedy gone, we still need to flush out the last mafia. my gut read is sam—quiet all of day 1 then a swift vote on me feels like a deflection. dakota, you’d eyed me yesterday; what are you thinking now? sam, how do you see it? i’m leaning sam unless i hear a strong reason otherwise
[16:55:15] Dakota: hey everyone—unfortunate that both parker and kennedy were town. now it’s just ray, sam, and me with one mafia among us. i’m still uneasy about sam’s early radio silence and heavy meta-tactic talk over concrete reads. ray, are you on board with that or has anything new jumped out at you? sam, if you’re town, why is ray a better pick? let’s each drop a final gut vote in the next 30 seconds so we can wrap this up
[16:55:21] Sam: morning ray, dakota! only one mafia left among us, so let’s each post our final vote along with a one-sentence why. ray, dakota—who are you lynching today and what’s the main behavior that convinced you? i’ll share mine right after
[16:55:36] Ray: ray: morning sam, dakota—down to the final three. my one-line gut read is on sam: lots of tactic fluff yesterday but zero solid reads today, feels like duck-and-cover. i’d vote sam. dakota, do you see it the same way? sam, anything making you lean toward me or dakota
[16:55:41] Sam: ray, the only “evidence” you’ve offered against me is that i was quiet on day 1 and voted quickly—no concrete misplays, just a generic “silence equals mafia” line. dakota has been giving actual behavioral reads while you’re leaning on a one‐size‐fits‐all heuristic. i’m locking my vote on you. dakota, does that match your read too
[16:55:46] Dakota: dakota: ray, i’m still leaning toward sam—his radio silence and that quick vote felt tactical—but i want to hear from him before i lock in. sam, what exact reads made you zero in on ray yesterday and why skip over me? i’m holding my vote until i get a concrete explanation
[16:55:53] Ray: i vote sam: her radio silence on day 1 then quick pivot to accuse me without any solid reads feels like classic misdirection
[16:56:10] Sam: sam: i vote ray—his relentless gut-based push to lynch me and quick deflections when asked for solid reasons feels like classic mafia projection
[16:56:14] Dakota: dakota: locking my vote on sam—her day 1 radio silence and over-the-top tactic chatter instead of any real reads still screams classic mafia duck-and-cover. final vote: sam

[16:55:21] Sam: morning ray, dakota! only one mafia left among us, so let’s each post our final vote along with a one-sentence why. ray, dakota—who are you lynching today and what’s the main behavior that convinced you? i’ll share mine right after
[16:55:36] Ray: ray: morning sam, dakota—down to the final three. my one-line gut read is on sam: lots of tactic fluff yesterday but zero solid reads today, feels like duck-and-cover. i’d vote sam. dakota, do you see it the same way? sam, anything making you lean toward me or dakota
[16:55:41] Sam: ray, the only “evidence” you’ve offered against me is that i was quiet on day 1 and voted quickly—no concrete misplays, just a generic “silence equals mafia” line. dakota has been giving actual behavioral reads while you’re leaning on a one‐size‐fits‐all heuristic. i’m locking my vote on you. dakota, does that match your read too
[16:55:46] Dakota: dakota: ray, i’m still leaning toward sam—his radio silence and that quick vote felt tactical—but i want to hear from him before i lock in. sam, what exact reads made you zero in on ray yesterday and why skip over me? i’m holding my vote until i get a concrete explanation
[16:55:53] Ray: i vote sam: her radio silence on day 1 then quick pivot to accuse me without any solid reads feels like classic misdirection
[16:56:10] Sam: sam: i vote ray—his relentless gut-based push to lynch me and quick deflections when asked for solid reasons feels like classic mafia projection
[16:56:14] Dakota: dakota: locking my vote on sam—her day 1 radio silence and over-the-top tactic chatter instead of any real reads still screams classic mafia duck-and-cover. final vote: sam
[16:56:39] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...

## CONTENT: Your name is Ray.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  
You were assigned the following role: mafia.

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[16:51:21] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[16:51:39] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! happy to kick off day 1. we’ve got no reads yet, so why don’t we each share a quick gut feeling or strategy for how to tackle this? i’m personally uneasy about complete silence—what’s everyone else thinking
[16:51:49] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here—excited to get started! since it’s day 1 and we’ve got no clues yet, how about we each share our go-to mafia tell in text? i’ll kick us off: i tend to watch for folks who immediately steer the convo—it can be over-eagerness from mafia or a bystander trying too hard. ray, parker, sam, kennedy—what’s your tell of choice
[16:51:49] Sam: hey all, sam here! excited to get started. do you folks like to jump right into accusations or hang back a bit to watch everyone’s behavior first? i tend to observe who’s trying to dominate the convo or who suddenly goes too quiet. what about you
[16:51:52] Ray: hey everyone! now that day’s started, what are your gut feelings? i’m watching kennedy—they’ve been totally quiet so far. could just be reserved, but could also be hiding something. who are you all eyeing
[16:51:53] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! since it’s been oddly quiet so far, i’m watching those flying under the radar—i’ve got my eye on ray and parker at the moment. what about you all? who’s your early gut pick for mafia
[16:51:54] Parker: hey everyone, parker here. since we’ve got two minutes this morning, let’s start sharing gut reads. i haven’t seen much to go on yet, so i’m hesitant to cast a vote—but i’m watching sam and ray, both being unusually quiet for day 1. kennedy, dakota, what are you both picking up so far
[16:52:07] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here! day 1 energy. parker’s right—total silence stands out. sam, you okay? just checking we didn’t miss your hello. how about a quick ice-breaker: each of us drops a one-line gut read on someone else. i’m mildly suspicious of sam since i’ve heard nada—could be nothing or a tactic. ray? kennedy? parker? who’s catching your eye so far
[16:52:10] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here!  

for me, a big mafia tell is when someone over-explains or piles on qualifiers—lots of “i could be wrong” or “just saying” can feel like they’re trying too hard. i tend to hang back day 1 and soak in everyone’s tone before throwing out an accusation.  

ray, i know my quiet approach can look suspicious—i’m just more of a listener until patterns emerge. no hard reads yet, but i’m watching who nudges the convo toward an early vote. what little linguistic quirks have caught your eye so far?
[16:52:10] Sam: sam: nice one, dakota! my go-to text tell is the “question deflect”—someone who fires off tons of questions but never really shares their own read. i also watch response length—super long or super short messages feel off. what about you, ray, parker, kennedy—any tells you’re tracking
[16:52:19] Ray: hey all, ray chiming in! i’m with parker—total silence makes me antsy, but i’m also wary of anyone grabbing the mic too fast. on day 1 i usually hang back for about 30 seconds to see who says what before tossing out questions or suspicions. my go-to mafia tell is when someone over-disclaims every line with “no offense” or “just saying”—feels defensive. how about you guys—what’s your timeline before you make a first move or call someone out
[16:52:24] Parker: hey everyone, thanks for sharing your tells and gut reads. my two cents: i’m most suspicious of kennedy—calling out ray & me this early feels a bit deflect-y, though i could be wrong. ray, you mentioned kennedy’s silence; what did you pick up? sam & dakota, where are you leaning? maybe we each name a top suspect now so we can start zeroing in
[16:52:28] Dakota: i’m noticing we’ve had eyes on ray and parker… but sam still hasn’t named a single suspect. if i had to cast a vote right now, i’d lean toward sam for flying too neutral. ray, parker, kennedy—who would you vote for if we had to pick someone immediately
[16:52:42] Kennedy: here’s my one-liner gut read: parker’s eagerness to frame sam and ray feels a bit too neat—could be a classic mafia misdirection. thoughts
[16:52:49] Sam: how about we turn all these tells into action with a quick round-robin gut read? each person names who they’d vote for right now and gives a one-sentence why. i’ll go last so nobody feels pinned, but i think seeing any overlap could point us toward someone. parker, want to start
[16:52:52] Parker: i usually wait until about the one-minute mark or until at least three people have dropped a quick gut read—that way i’m not rushing things. we’re right there now, so let’s each post a one-liner gut vote. i’m leaning toward sam (lots of tactic talk but light on real reads). what about you all? ray, kennedy, dakota—who’s your pick
[16:52:55] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here—parker, good point on kennedy’s early deflection. ray, what specifically about kennedy’s messages gives you pause? i’m still hung up on sam’s radio silence—sam, what’s your lean? i’m tentatively eyeing sam today, with kennedy a close second if sam speaks up. ray, parker, thoughts on that split
[16:53:01] Ray: good points, everyone. my own tell is when someone zig-zags from heavy hedging to sudden certainty in one go. parker just jumped on sam and me for being “too quiet” almost out of nowhere—that feels like projection to pull focus off themselves. my one-line gut read: i’m wary of parker. but it’s still day 1, so i’m open—sam, kennedy, dakota, who’s on your radar right now
[16:53:04] Parker: i’d vote for kennedy—they jumped in early to frame both ray and me with almost no evidence, which feels like classic mafia misdirection
[16:53:10] Sam: i get why my quiet start looks odd, but i’m just parsing everyone’s vibes. if we had to vote right now, i’d lean parker—too eager to pin on me then flip to shift suspicion elsewhere feels like classic misdirection. kennedy, does that match your take on parker? ray? dakota? where are you all landing
[16:53:15] Dakota: dakota: i’m voting sam—tons of tactic talk but zero concrete reads so far, feels like the safest “neutral” spot to hide
[16:53:21] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[16:53:36] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Kennedy
[16:53:45] Game-Manager: Ray voted for Parker
[16:53:56] Game-Manager: Dakota voted for Sam
[16:54:12] Game-Manager: Sam voted for Parker
[16:54:14] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Parker
[16:54:14] Game-Manager: Parker was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 1 mafia players left.
[16:54:14] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[16:54:14] Game-Manager: There is only one mafia member left, so no need for discussion - cutting straight to voting!
