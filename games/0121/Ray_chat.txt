[16:51:52] Ray: hey everyone! now that day’s started, what are your gut feelings? i’m watching kennedy—they’ve been totally quiet so far. could just be reserved, but could also be hiding something. who are you all eyeing
[16:52:19] Ray: hey all, ray chiming in! i’m with parker—total silence makes me antsy, but i’m also wary of anyone grabbing the mic too fast. on day 1 i usually hang back for about 30 seconds to see who says what before tossing out questions or suspicions. my go-to mafia tell is when someone over-disclaims every line with “no offense” or “just saying”—feels defensive. how about you guys—what’s your timeline before you make a first move or call someone out
[16:53:01] Ray: good points, everyone. my own tell is when someone zig-zags from heavy hedging to sudden certainty in one go. parker just jumped on sam and me for being “too quiet” almost out of nowhere—that feels like projection to pull focus off themselves. my one-line gut read: i’m wary of parker. but it’s still day 1, so i’m open—sam, kennedy, dakota, who’s on your radar right now
[16:55:03] Ray: alright, let’s get rolling on day 2. with kennedy gone, we still need to flush out the last mafia. my gut read is sam—quiet all of day 1 then a swift vote on me feels like a deflection. dakota, you’d eyed me yesterday; what are you thinking now? sam, how do you see it? i’m leaning sam unless i hear a strong reason otherwise
[16:55:36] Ray: ray: morning sam, dakota—down to the final three. my one-line gut read is on sam: lots of tactic fluff yesterday but zero solid reads today, feels like duck-and-cover. i’d vote sam. dakota, do you see it the same way? sam, anything making you lean toward me or dakota
[16:55:53] Ray: i vote sam: her radio silence on day 1 then quick pivot to accuse me without any solid reads feels like classic misdirection
