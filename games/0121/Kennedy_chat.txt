[16:51:53] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! since it’s been oddly quiet so far, i’m watching those flying under the radar—i’ve got my eye on ray and parker at the moment. what about you all? who’s your early gut pick for mafia

for me, a big mafia tell is when someone over-explains or piles on qualifiers—lots of “i could be wrong” or “just saying” can feel like they’re trying too hard. i tend to hang back day 1 and soak in everyone’s tone before throwing out an accusation.
