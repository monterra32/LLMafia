[16:51:49] Sam: hey all, sam here! excited to get started. do you folks like to jump right into accusations or hang back a bit to watch everyone’s behavior first? i tend to observe who’s trying to dominate the convo or who suddenly goes too quiet. what about you
[16:52:10] Sam: sam: nice one, dakota! my go-to text tell is the “question deflect”—someone who fires off tons of questions but never really shares their own read. i also watch response length—super long or super short messages feel off. what about you, ray, parker, kennedy—any tells you’re tracking
[16:52:49] Sam: how about we turn all these tells into action with a quick round-robin gut read? each person names who they’d vote for right now and gives a one-sentence why. i’ll go last so nobody feels pinned, but i think seeing any overlap could point us toward someone. parker, want to start
[16:53:10] Sam: i get why my quiet start looks odd, but i’m just parsing everyone’s vibes. if we had to vote right now, i’d lean parker—too eager to pin on me then flip to shift suspicion elsewhere feels like classic misdirection. kennedy, does that match your take on parker? ray? dakota? where are you all landing
[16:55:21] Sam: morning ray, dakota! only one mafia left among us, so let’s each post our final vote along with a one-sentence why. ray, dakota—who are you lynching today and what’s the main behavior that convinced you? i’ll share mine right after
[16:55:41] Sam: ray, the only “evidence” you’ve offered against me is that i was quiet on day 1 and voted quickly—no concrete misplays, just a generic “silence equals mafia” line. dakota has been giving actual behavioral reads while you’re leaning on a one‐size‐fits‐all heuristic. i’m locking my vote on you. dakota, does that match your read too
[16:56:10] Sam: sam: i vote ray—his relentless gut-based push to lynch me and quick deflections when asked for solid reasons feels like classic mafia projection
