[16:51:49] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here—excited to get started! since it’s day 1 and we’ve got no clues yet, how about we each share our go-to mafia tell in text? i’ll kick us off: i tend to watch for folks who immediately steer the convo—it can be over-eagerness from mafia or a bystander trying too hard. ray, parker, sam, kennedy—what’s your tell of choice
[16:52:07] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here! day 1 energy. parker’s right—total silence stands out. sam, you okay? just checking we didn’t miss your hello. how about a quick ice-breaker: each of us drops a one-line gut read on someone else. i’m mildly suspicious of sam since i’ve heard nada—could be nothing or a tactic. ray? kennedy? parker? who’s catching your eye so far
[16:52:28] Dakota: i’m noticing we’ve had eyes on ray and parker… but sam still hasn’t named a single suspect. if i had to cast a vote right now, i’d lean toward sam for flying too neutral. ray, parker, kennedy—who would you vote for if we had to pick someone immediately
[16:52:55] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here—parker, good point on kennedy’s early deflection. ray, what specifically about kennedy’s messages gives you pause? i’m still hung up on sam’s radio silence—sam, what’s your lean? i’m tentatively eyeing sam today, with kennedy a close second if sam speaks up. ray, parker, thoughts on that split
[16:53:15] Dakota: dakota: i’m voting sam—tons of tactic talk but zero concrete reads so far, feels like the safest “neutral” spot to hide
[16:55:15] Dakota: hey everyone—unfortunate that both parker and kennedy were town. now it’s just ray, sam, and me with one mafia among us. i’m still uneasy about sam’s early radio silence and heavy meta-tactic talk over concrete reads. ray, are you on board with that or has anything new jumped out at you? sam, if you’re town, why is ray a better pick? let’s each drop a final gut vote in the next 30 seconds so we can wrap this up
[16:55:46] Dakota: dakota: ray, i’m still leaning toward sam—his radio silence and that quick vote felt tactical—but i want to hear from him before i lock in. sam, what exact reads made you zero in on ray yesterday and why skip over me? i’m holding my vote until i get a concrete explanation
[16:56:14] Dakota: dakota: locking my vote on sam—her day 1 radio silence and over-the-top tactic chatter instead of any real reads still screams classic mafia duck-and-cover. final vote: sam
