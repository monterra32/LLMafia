[17:33:15] Sam: hey everyone, sam here! excited to get started. since it’s day 1 and nobody’s gone yet, let’s break the ice with our first impressions: anyone strike you as a bit too quiet or maybe overly eager already? i’m watching parker’s radio silence—what do you all think
[17:33:28] Sam: hey everyone, sam here! for my fun fact, i’m a bit obsessed with building tiny jazz clubs out of matchboxes—i’ve got a whole smoky speakeasy scene on my bookshelf. as for vibes, i’m noticing kennedy’s super enthusiastic and parker’s playing it cool, hanging back to observe. ray and dakota haven’t said much yet, so i’m curious what they’re thinking. excited to see how everyone plays this round
[17:34:30] Sam: sam: ray, i get that my quick finger-pointing might look like deflection, but if i were mafia i’d lie low, not lead the charge. i was just trying to spark discussion. parker—your fun fact was awesome, but what’s your gut hunch? kennedy, dakota—does ray’s take change your votes? let’s lock in some names before time runs out
[17:34:48] Sam: sam here—my gut pick is parker. his “i’m just watching” act, followed by a barrage of loaded questions, feels more like mafia fishing for tells than honest input. he’s steered every conversation but still won’t actually name anyone he’s suspicious of. that defensive info-gathering combo stands out to me. parker—if you’ve got a read on someone, now’s the time to share it. otherwise that silence-plus-probing bit just looks off
