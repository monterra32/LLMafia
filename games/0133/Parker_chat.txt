[17:33:15] Parker: hey everyone—i’m parker! excited for daytime. since we’ve all been quiet so far, how about a quick go-around: share any little tells or vibes you’re picking up on, no pressure. i’ll be sticking low-key so i can watch who jumps in fastest versus who hangs back. what are you all noticing so far
[17:33:29] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! quirky hobby: i’m a bit of a competitive jigsaw puzzler—i once knocked out a 3,000-piece puzzle in under five days while binging a new series. definitely makes for some intense snack breaks. excited to hear more about you all—sam, what’s your fun fact
[17:34:11] Parker: sam, that matchbox jazz club sounds awesome! for my fun fact: i’m into extreme ironing—yes, pressing shirts on mountaintops. ray, kennedy, dakota—what quirky hobby are you hiding? dakota, you flagged me as odd—what tipped you off? ray, you pointed at kennedy—what vibe did you pick up? let’s hear everyone’s angle before we start pinning votes
[17:34:28] Parker: hey everyone, let’s unpack a bit before we vote.

ray—what shifted your gut from me to sam so quickly? was it something specific in sam’s wording or timing that stood out?  
dakota—i’m not hiding so much as sizing up everyone’s reactions; what about my quieter approach feels tactical rather than just observation?  
sam—you jumped on me right off the bat—what in my few lines gave you that strong “mafia” vibe?  
kennedy—great point about chatty vs. quiet: any particular turns of phrase or pacing from anyone else that strike you as odd?  

let’s call out the exact comments or pauses that raised eyebrows so we’re not just voting on general vibes. thoughts?
[17:34:45] Parker: i’ll go with sam as my gut pick—sam was the first to steer suspicion onto me without any real evidence. sam, what made you zero in on me so fast? ray and kennedy, do you think that’s just a day 1 hunch or could it be a pressure move
[17:41:44] Parker: hey ray, dakota—we’re down to the final three and one of you is mafia. i’m leaning on ray here—he drove day 1’s lynch hard then has been tight-lipped on dakota, and if he were an innocent i’d expect a stronger push now. also, why do you think the mafia killed kennedy instead of me last night? dakota, does that change your read on ray vs. you? let’s hear quick, concrete reads—i’ll lock in my vote in 30 seconds
[17:42:41] Parker: ray, here are two concrete red flags on you:

1. you’ve flip-flopped targets all day without any specifics—first kennedy, then sam, now me—just “gut feelings” with zero examples.  
2. you’ve never explained why the mafia would spare their biggest threat (me) last night and kill kennedy instead—if i were mafia, i’d be the first to go.

by contrast, dakota has consistently backed her suspicions with patterns of behavior, even if they’re pressed for details. i see no real red flags on her. i’m locking in my vote on ray. ray—if you’re truly innocent, give us one specific, evidence-based reason to vote dakota instead
