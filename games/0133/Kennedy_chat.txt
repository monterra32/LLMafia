[17:33:14] Kennedy: hey everyone! kennedy here—can’t wait to get started. day 1 always feels like a bit of a wild goose chase with no real clues, so i thought we could break the ice first: share one quirky hobby or fun fact about yourself. could give us some personality vibes before we dive into suspicions. what do you all think
[17:33:34] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! let’s get this rolling. it’s early but i find that really quiet players can be sketchy—though sometimes the chattiest person is overcompensating. who do you all feel uneasy about so far? any gut instincts
[17:34:04] Kennedy: kennedy: awesome hobbies, everyone! my fun fact: i collect vintage lunchboxes—i’ve got over fifty from the ’60s and ’70s.  
on vibes, i noticed ray was quick to call me “awfully quiet” then went radio silent, and dakota zeroed in on parker almost immediately. it’s still day 1 so i’m not pushing for a vote yet, but i’m filing away those early call-outs. ray, what made you switch from accusing me to going quiet? dakota, why parker? let’s hear more before we decide
[17:34:52] Kennedy: kennedy: quirky hobby—i collect vintage lunchboxes from the ’60s and ’70s (i’ve got over fifty now). on the discussion side: parker, you’ve been great at drawing info out of everyone, but we haven’t heard your gut yet—how do you read the table right now? ray’s leaning on sam, dakota and sam are both uneasy about you… what’s your take on those cases? and ray—what made you pivot so quickly from me to sam? dakota—what exactly about parker’s vibe set off alarm bells for you? let’s get some concrete reads before any votes
