[17:33:27] Ray: ray: hey everyone! ray here. day 1 is always a bit of a blur with no solid clues yet, so let’s lean on gut instincts. i’ve noticed kennedy’s been awfully quiet so far—silence can be telling, though it might just be nerves. kennedy, what’s your take? anyone else picking up on any vibes
[17:33:53] Ray: hey everyone, ray here! since kennedy kicked off the fun‐fact train, i’ll share mine—i’m a vintage camera nerd and have a soft spot for polaroids from the ’80s. on to suspicions: i’m not convinced parker’s radio silence equals guilt—sometimes the real mafia lie low. instead, sam’s very quick push to point at parker feels a bit too eager, like steering the vote before any real discussion. my gut is on sam for today. what do you all think—could sam be deflecting
[17:34:30] Ray: hey everyone—my fun fact: i’m an amateur coffee roaster and spend weekends experimenting with small-batch blends. as for vibes, i haven’t heard any concrete hunches yet—sam, your matchbox jazz clubs are awesome but i’m still waiting on a suspect from you; kennedy, you’ve talked about quiet vs. chatty players but haven’t named a target; dakota, your spoon-carving question on low-key play makes me wonder who you’d call out; parker, you say you’re hanging back then immediately dive into others’ tactics.  

so let’s get specific: i’m uneasy about parker’s probing questions—feels like observation without ownership. now each of you drop one person you genuinely feel suspicious of and why. sam? kennedy? dakota? parker?
[17:34:50] Ray: hey everyone, here’s why i’m still sticking on sam:

1. sam’s very first comment zeroed in on “radio silence” around parker—textbook deflection, calling out a quiet player before any real discussion.  
2. in the next round, sam quickly pivoted to lumping me and dakota in as “haven’t said much,” steering suspicion multiple times in just two lines.  
3. by contrast, parker and kennedy have been digging for specifics (“what phrasing felt off?”) and dakota made a clear case on parker we can actually test.

sam’s eagerness to grab any little pause and point a finger screams deflection. i’m casting my vote on sam unless someone can hit me with an equally specific red flag for kennedy, dakota, or parker. over to you all. vote: sam
[17:41:40] Ray: ray: i’m switching my vote to dakota. she’s been great at grilling everyone else for specifics but hasn’t committed her own hunch until now—feels like deflection to me. parker, you’ve been sharp on reading pacing and tone—does that strike you as dodge behavior
[17:42:50] Ray: tough break losing kennedy last night after sam in the day. with just three of us now, i need a solid lead. i’m voting parker: her day-one play was full of pointed questions but zero commitment—then she singled out sam and shrugged at kennedy. parker, what specific line made you feel safe enough to sit back on kennedy? dakota, does that feel like cautious play or tactical deflection to you
