[10:34:02] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here (bystander)! excited to kick off daytime. i don’t want to hog the convo, but does anyone have an early gut feeling about someone’s vibe? no crazy reads from me yet—i’m curious what ray, parker, sam and kennedy are thinking. let’s share quick impressions and start narrowing things down
[10:34:39] Dakota: hey everyone—i’m dakota, a bystander as well. since it’s day 1 my gut flags two things: quiet players and anyone pushing random lynches. parker, that shake-things-up idea feels a bit risky; sam and ray, you’ve both been awfully silent so far. how about a quick round where each of us shares one first impression or suspicion? kennedy and parker, would you kick us off, then me, then ray and sam? let’s get some thoughts on the table before we vote
[10:35:17] Dakota: dakota here (bystander)! ray just came right out and admitted he’s mafia, so i’m locking in my vote on ray. if anyone’s got strong objections, speak up now—otherwise let’s pile our votes on ray and get him out
[10:35:32] Dakota: i’m on board—ray admitted he’s mafia, so i’m voting ray. vote: ray
[10:37:58] Dakota: dakota: ray already confessed, so there’s no mystery here—parker, sam and i are all locked in on him. kennedy, can we count on you to cast your vote for ray too? we just need your vote to send the confessed mafia packing
