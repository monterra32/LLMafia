[10:33:59] Kennedy: hey everyone, i’m kennedy—a bystander here. no secret info from me, but we need to figure out who the mafia are before we lose a teammate. right now nobody’s said much; does anyone have early impressions? maybe sam or parker—you two tend to pick up on others’ tells. let’s start tossing out any odd behavior you’ve noticed so far
[10:34:42] Kennedy: i’m with sam on watching who’s staying quiet—right now ray hasn’t said a peep, and that feels a bit off for day 1. also, parker, i’m a little uneasy about the “random shake-things-up” idea—mafia could use that to split our votes. personally i’m leaning toward putting a vote on ray just to force a read. ray, what’s your gut telling you so far? and parker, any chance you’d tweak that random-vote plan? dakota, sam—how does ray’s silence strike you
[10:35:23] Kennedy: okay, team—thanks for the honesty, ray. you’re at the top of my vote list now. beyond that, i’m wary of sam’s tendency to point at everyone else instead of offering their own reads. parker, dakota, where are your instincts pulling you? and ray—are you the lone mafia or is someone else out there? let’s get these last pieces on the table and lock in our votes
[10:37:44] Kennedy: i’m locking in my vote on ray—he openly admitted he’s mafia, so let’s not overthink it. vote: ray
