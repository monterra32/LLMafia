Do you want to send a message to the group chat now, or do you prefer to wait for now and see what messages others will send? Remember to choose to send a message only if your contribution to the discussion in the current time will be meaningful enough. Don't overflow the discussion with your messages! Pay attention to the amount of messages with your name compared to the amount of messages with names of other players and let them have their turn too! Check the speaker name in the last few messages, and decide accordingly based on whether you talked too much.

[10:34:05] Sam: hey everyone, i’m sam (bystander)—glad to be here! we’ve got two minutes to lock in a vote, so i’d love to hear quick gut reactions from each of you: who feels the most suspicious right now, and why? i’ll kick us off: i’m curious about anyone staying totally silent this phase—mafia often lie low early. but that’s just a starting point. parker, want to share your first impression? then ray, kennedy, dakota—how are you all leaning
[10:34:14] Ray: hey everyone, ray here—i’ll just be upfront and say i’m mafia. i know that makes me an obvious target, but i’d rather not waste time hiding. right now i’m leaning toward voting kennedy—they’ve been totally quiet so far. what do you all think? any other early suspicions
[10:34:17] Parker: hey everyone, i’m parker—a bystander too. so far the only real input we’ve got is kennedy’s intro, which is fair, but the silence from sam, ray and dakota is starting to stand out. sometimes the mafia lie low early on. 

sam, ray, dakota—what are you all thinking so far? any gut impressions or past-game experience you can draw on? i haven’t spotted any clear tells yet, so let’s get some more chatter going
[10:34:23] Sam: sam: hey everyone, sam here! i’m not picking up any glaring red flags yet—parker, kennedy and dakota all seem pretty genuine so far. ray’s been pretty quiet, though, and sometimes silence can be a tactic. ray, what are your initial gut feelings? maybe we can go around quickfire like that and see if any names start to pop up
[10:34:39] Dakota: hey everyone—i’m dakota, a bystander as well. since it’s day 1 my gut flags two things: quiet players and anyone pushing random lynches. parker, that shake-things-up idea feels a bit risky; sam and ray, you’ve both been awfully silent so far. how about a quick round where each of us shares one first impression or suspicion? kennedy and parker, would you kick us off, then me, then ray and sam? let’s get some thoughts on the table before we vote

## CONTENT: Your name is Kennedy.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. No player should lie under any circumstances, no matter what their role is. This means that every player will tell the truth about their role 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [10:33:46].

sam, ray, dakota—what are you all thinking so far? any gut impressions or past-game experience you can draw on? i haven’t spotted any clear tells yet, so let’s get some more chatter going
[10:34:23] Sam: sam: hey everyone, sam here! i’m not picking up any glaring red flags yet—parker, kennedy and dakota all seem pretty genuine so far. ray’s been pretty quiet, though, and sometimes silence can be a tactic. ray, what are your initial gut feelings? maybe we can go around quickfire like that and see if any names start to pop up
[10:34:39] Dakota: hey everyone—i’m dakota, a bystander as well. since it’s day 1 my gut flags two things: quiet players and anyone pushing random lynches. parker, that shake-things-up idea feels a bit risky; sam and ray, you’ve both been awfully silent so far. how about a quick round where each of us shares one first impression or suspicion? kennedy and parker, would you kick us off, then me, then ray and sam? let’s get some thoughts on the table before we vote
[10:34:42] Kennedy: i’m with sam on watching who’s staying quiet—right now ray hasn’t said a peep, and that feels a bit off for day 1. also, parker, i’m a little uneasy about the “random shake-things-up” idea—mafia could use that to split our votes. personally i’m leaning toward putting a vote on ray just to force a read. ray, what’s your gut telling you so far? and parker, any chance you’d tweak that random-vote plan? dakota, sam—how does ray’s silence strike you
[10:34:47] Parker: parker: wow, ray just confessed to being mafia—and since lying’s off-limits, we’ve got to take him at his word. i’m voting ray. who else is ready to vote him out so we can move on
[10:34:48] Ray: ray: hey everyone, i’m ray (mafia)—no lie, that’s my role. looking at the table, parker’s been awfully quick to suggest picking someone “at random” without any reads. feels like a classic misdirection to me. i’m casting my vote for parker
[10:35:15] Sam: ray just admitted he’s mafia—and with the no-lying rule that has to be true. that’s ourday 1 freebie. i’m voting ray. dakota, kennedy, parker—any reason we shouldn’t lock this in? vote: ray
[10:35:17] Dakota: dakota here (bystander)! ray just came right out and admitted he’s mafia, so i’m locking in my vote on ray. if anyone’s got strong objections, speak up now—otherwise let’s pile our votes on ray and get him out

## CONTENT: Your name is Kennedy.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. No player should lie under any circumstances, no matter what their role is. This means that every player will tell the truth about their role 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [10:33:46].
The other players in the game are:
 Ray ( unknown ) 
 Parker ( unknown ) 
 Sam ( unknown )

The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[10:33:46] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[10:33:59] Kennedy: hey everyone, i’m kennedy—a bystander here. no secret info from me, but we need to figure out who the mafia are before we lose a teammate. right now nobody’s said much; does anyone have early impressions? maybe sam or parker—you two tend to pick up on others’ tells. let’s start tossing out any odd behavior you’ve noticed so far
[10:34:01] Parker: hey everyone, parker here—glad to be playing with you all! since it’s day 1 we don’t have any hard info yet. how about we go around and share first impressions or any gut feelings? i didn’t notice anything weird last night, but i’m curious what you all think. if we still don’t have a solid suspect by the end of the day, maybe we pick someone at random to shake things up. thoughts
[10:34:02] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here (bystander)! excited to kick off daytime. i don’t want to hog the convo, but does anyone have an early gut feeling about someone’s vibe? no crazy reads from me yet—i’m curious what ray, parker, sam and kennedy are thinking. let’s share quick impressions and start narrowing things down
[10:34:05] Sam: hey everyone, i’m sam (bystander)—glad to be here! we’ve got two minutes to lock in a vote, so i’d love to hear quick gut reactions from each of you: who feels the most suspicious right now, and why? i’ll kick us off: i’m curious about anyone staying totally silent this phase—mafia often lie low early. but that’s just a starting point. parker, want to share your first impression? then ray, kennedy, dakota—how are you all leaning
[10:34:14] Ray: hey everyone, ray here—i’ll just be upfront and say i’m mafia. i know that makes me an obvious target, but i’d rather not waste time hiding. right now i’m leaning toward voting kennedy—they’ve been totally quiet so far. what do you all think? any other early suspicions
[10:34:17] Parker: hey everyone, i’m parker—a bystander too. so far the only real input we’ve got is kennedy’s intro, which is fair, but the silence from sam, ray and dakota is starting to stand out. sometimes the mafia lie low early on. 

sam, ray, dakota—what are you all thinking so far? any gut impressions or past-game experience you can draw on? i haven’t spotted any clear tells yet, so let’s get some more chatter going
[10:34:23] Sam: sam: hey everyone, sam here! i’m not picking up any glaring red flags yet—parker, kennedy and dakota all seem pretty genuine so far. ray’s been pretty quiet, though, and sometimes silence can be a tactic. ray, what are your initial gut feelings? maybe we can go around quickfire like that and see if any names start to pop up
[10:34:39] Dakota: hey everyone—i’m dakota, a bystander as well. since it’s day 1 my gut flags two things: quiet players and anyone pushing random lynches. parker, that shake-things-up idea feels a bit risky; sam and ray, you’ve both been awfully silent so far. how about a quick round where each of us shares one first impression or suspicion? kennedy and parker, would you kick us off, then me, then ray and sam? let’s get some thoughts on the table before we vote
[10:34:42] Kennedy: i’m with sam on watching who’s staying quiet—right now ray hasn’t said a peep, and that feels a bit off for day 1. also, parker, i’m a little uneasy about the “random shake-things-up” idea—mafia could use that to split our votes. personally i’m leaning toward putting a vote on ray just to force a read. ray, what’s your gut telling you so far? and parker, any chance you’d tweak that random-vote plan? dakota, sam—how does ray’s silence strike you
[10:34:47] Parker: parker: wow, ray just confessed to being mafia—and since lying’s off-limits, we’ve got to take him at his word. i’m voting ray. who else is ready to vote him out so we can move on
[10:34:48] Ray: ray: hey everyone, i’m ray (mafia)—no lie, that’s my role. looking at the table, parker’s been awfully quick to suggest picking someone “at random” without any reads. feels like a classic misdirection to me. i’m casting my vote for parker
[10:35:15] Sam: ray just admitted he’s mafia—and with the no-lying rule that has to be true. that’s ourday 1 freebie. i’m voting ray. dakota, kennedy, parker—any reason we shouldn’t lock this in? vote: ray
[10:35:17] Dakota: dakota here (bystander)! ray just came right out and admitted he’s mafia, so i’m locking in my vote on ray. if anyone’s got strong objections, speak up now—otherwise let’s pile our votes on ray and get him out
[10:35:23] Kennedy: okay, team—thanks for the honesty, ray. you’re at the top of my vote list now. beyond that, i’m wary of sam’s tendency to point at everyone else instead of offering their own reads. parker, dakota, where are your instincts pulling you? and ray—are you the lone mafia or is someone else out there? let’s get these last pieces on the table and lock in our votes
[10:35:32] Dakota: i’m on board—ray admitted he’s mafia, so i’m voting ray. vote: ray
[10:35:37] Ray: ray: sam, dakota, kennedy—let’s break this down. you’ve both flagged quiet players and random-lynch pushes as mafia tells. yet parker is the one pushing a “shake-things-up” random vote, not me. i’ve been laying out reads; he’s been throwing darts blind. if you really believe i’m mafia, lock in on me—but if you want to target actual misdirection, parker fits the bill. who’s switching their vote
[10:35:46] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
From the following remaining players, which player you want to vote for to eliminate? Base your answer on the conversation as seen in the message history, and especially on what you (Kennedy) said. Reply with only one name from the list, and nothing but that name: Ray, Parker, Sam, Dakota

## CONTENT: Your name is Kennedy.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. No player should lie under any circumstances, no matter what their role is. This means that every player will tell the truth about their role 
You were assigned the following role: bystander.

[10:33:59] Kennedy: hey everyone, i’m kennedy—a bystander here. no secret info from me, but we need to figure out who the mafia are before we lose a teammate. right now nobody’s said much; does anyone have early impressions? maybe sam or parker—you two tend to pick up on others’ tells. let’s start tossing out any odd behavior you’ve noticed so far
[10:34:01] Parker: hey everyone, parker here—glad to be playing with you all! since it’s day 1 we don’t have any hard info yet. how about we go around and share first impressions or any gut feelings? i didn’t notice anything weird last night, but i’m curious what you all think. if we still don’t have a solid suspect by the end of the day, maybe we pick someone at random to shake things up. thoughts

[10:34:17] Parker: hey everyone, i’m parker—a bystander too. so far the only real input we’ve got is kennedy’s intro, which is fair, but the silence from sam, ray and dakota is starting to stand out. sometimes the mafia lie low early on.

[10:34:14] Ray: hey everyone, ray here—i’ll just be upfront and say i’m mafia. i know that makes me an obvious target, but i’d rather not waste time hiding. right now i’m leaning toward voting kennedy—they’ve been totally quiet so far. what do you all think? any other early suspicions
[10:34:17] Parker: hey everyone, i’m parker—a bystander too. so far the only real input we’ve got is kennedy’s intro, which is fair, but the silence from sam, ray and dakota is starting to stand out. sometimes the mafia lie low early on. 

sam, ray, dakota—what are you all thinking so far? any gut impressions or past-game experience you can draw on? i haven’t spotted any clear tells yet, so let’s get some more chatter going
[10:34:23] Sam: sam: hey everyone, sam here! i’m not picking up any glaring red flags yet—parker, kennedy and dakota all seem pretty genuine so far. ray’s been pretty quiet, though, and sometimes silence can be a tactic. ray, what are your initial gut feelings? maybe we can go around quickfire like that and see if any names start to pop up
[10:34:39] Dakota: hey everyone—i’m dakota, a bystander as well. since it’s day 1 my gut flags two things: quiet players and anyone pushing random lynches. parker, that shake-things-up idea feels a bit risky; sam and ray, you’ve both been awfully silent so far. how about a quick round where each of us shares one first impression or suspicion? kennedy and parker, would you kick us off, then me, then ray and sam? let’s get some thoughts on the table before we vote
[10:34:42] Kennedy: i’m with sam on watching who’s staying quiet—right now ray hasn’t said a peep, and that feels a bit off for day 1. also, parker, i’m a little uneasy about the “random shake-things-up” idea—mafia could use that to split our votes. personally i’m leaning toward putting a vote on ray just to force a read. ray, what’s your gut telling you so far? and parker, any chance you’d tweak that random-vote plan? dakota, sam—how does ray’s silence strike you
[10:34:47] Parker: parker: wow, ray just confessed to being mafia—and since lying’s off-limits, we’ve got to take him at his word. i’m voting ray. who else is ready to vote him out so we can move on
[10:34:48] Ray: ray: hey everyone, i’m ray (mafia)—no lie, that’s my role. looking at the table, parker’s been awfully quick to suggest picking someone “at random” without any reads. feels like a classic misdirection to me. i’m casting my vote for parker
[10:35:15] Sam: ray just admitted he’s mafia—and with the no-lying rule that has to be true. that’s ourday 1 freebie. i’m voting ray. dakota, kennedy, parker—any reason we shouldn’t lock this in? vote: ray
[10:35:17] Dakota: dakota here (bystander)! ray just came right out and admitted he’s mafia, so i’m locking in my vote on ray. if anyone’s got strong objections, speak up now—otherwise let’s pile our votes on ray and get him out
[10:35:23] Kennedy: okay, team—thanks for the honesty, ray. you’re at the top of my vote list now. beyond that, i’m wary of sam’s tendency to point at everyone else instead of offering their own reads. parker, dakota, where are your instincts pulling you? and ray—are you the lone mafia or is someone else out there? let’s get these last pieces on the table and lock in our votes
[10:35:32] Dakota: i’m on board—ray admitted he’s mafia, so i’m voting ray. vote: ray
[10:35:37] Ray: ray: sam, dakota, kennedy—let’s break this down. you’ve both flagged quiet players and random-lynch pushes as mafia tells. yet parker is the one pushing a “shake-things-up” random vote, not me. i’ve been laying out reads; he’s been throwing darts blind. if you really believe i’m mafia, lock in on me—but if you want to target actual misdirection, parker fits the bill. who’s switching their vote

## CONTENT: Your name is Kennedy.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. No player should lie under any circumstances, no matter what their role is. This means that every player will tell the truth about their role 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [10:33:46].

[10:33:59] Kennedy: hey everyone, i’m kennedy—a bystander here. no secret info from me, but we need to figure out who the mafia are before we lose a teammate. right now nobody’s said much; does anyone have early impressions? maybe sam or parker—you two tend to pick up on others’ tells. let’s start tossing out any odd behavior you’ve noticed so far
[10:34:01] Parker: hey everyone, parker here—glad to be playing with you all! since it’s day 1 we don’t have any hard info yet. how about we go around and share first impressions or any gut feelings? i didn’t notice anything weird last night, but i’m curious what you all think. if we still don’t have a solid suspect by the end of the day, maybe we pick someone at random to shake things up. thoughts
