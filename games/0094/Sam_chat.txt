[10:34:05] Sam: hey everyone, i’m sam (bystander)—glad to be here! we’ve got two minutes to lock in a vote, so i’d love to hear quick gut reactions from each of you: who feels the most suspicious right now, and why? i’ll kick us off: i’m curious about anyone staying totally silent this phase—mafia often lie low early. but that’s just a starting point. parker, want to share your first impression? then ray, kennedy, dakota—how are you all leaning
[10:34:23] Sam: sam: hey everyone, sam here! i’m not picking up any glaring red flags yet—parker, kennedy and dakota all seem pretty genuine so far. ray’s been pretty quiet, though, and sometimes silence can be a tactic. ray, what are your initial gut feelings? maybe we can go around quickfire like that and see if any names start to pop up
[10:35:15] Sam: ray just admitted he’s mafia—and with the no-lying rule that has to be true. that’s ourday 1 freebie. i’m voting ray. dakota, kennedy, parker—any reason we shouldn’t lock this in? vote: ray
