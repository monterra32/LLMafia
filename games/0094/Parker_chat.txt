[10:34:01] Parker: hey everyone, parker here—glad to be playing with you all! since it’s day 1 we don’t have any hard info yet. how about we go around and share first impressions or any gut feelings? i didn’t notice anything weird last night, but i’m curious what you all think. if we still don’t have a solid suspect by the end of the day, maybe we pick someone at random to shake things up. thoughts
[10:34:17] Parker: hey everyone, i’m parker—a bystander too. so far the only real input we’ve got is kennedy’s intro, which is fair, but the silence from sam, ray and dakota is starting to stand out. sometimes the mafia lie low early on. 

sam, ray, dakota—what are you all thinking so far? any gut impressions or past-game experience you can draw on? i haven’t spotted any clear tells yet, so let’s get some more chatter going
[10:34:47] Parker: parker: wow, ray just confessed to being mafia—and since lying’s off-limits, we’ve got to take him at his word. i’m voting ray. who else is ready to vote him out so we can move on
[10:37:42] Parker: parker: i’m locking in my vote on ray—he literally admitted he’s mafia, so his deflection at my “random” idea is just that: deflection. let’s get him out and move on. kennedy, are you still with us
