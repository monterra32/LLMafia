[11:25:51] Sam: hey everyone, any initial suspicions on who might be mafia
[11:25:53] Parker: morning everyone—who’s standing out as suspicious so far
[11:25:59] Dakota: morning everyone—any initial thoughts on who might be the mafia
[11:26:00] Kennedy: morning everyone—any initial suspicions
[11:26:03] Ray: anyone notice anything suspicious last night
[11:26:03] Parker: i don’t have much yet, but kennedy’s awfully quiet
[11:26:05] Sam: morning all, any early suspects on your radar
[11:26:13] Kennedy: ray’s been pretty quiet so far—what do you all think about him
[11:26:14] Sam: why is everyone so eager to point at kennedy—it feels off
[11:26:20] Dakota: kennedy’s been awfully quiet—anyone else think that’s a bit odd
[11:26:22] Ray: morning everyone—does anyone have solid reasons to point at someone yet
[11:26:33] Dakota: i’m leaning toward ray being the real mafia given how quiet he’s been
[11:26:36] Ray: are we just bandwagoning on parker’s suspicion of kennedy
[11:26:38] Sam: i agree ray’s silence is odd—dakota, what’s your take on him
[11:26:38] Kennedy: did anyone else catch how quickly ray backed dakota yesterday
[11:26:50] Parker: i’m curious—what exactly about kennedy’s behavior struck you as suspicious
[11:26:50] Dakota: parker, you flagged kennedy—what in her behavior struck you as suspicious
[11:26:56] Ray: dakota—what made you switch from suspecting kennedy to me so quickly
[11:27:02] Parker: i’m curious why you backed dakota so fast, ray
[11:27:08] Dakota: i noticed kennedy deflected every question and never offered concrete reasons for her suspicions
[11:27:13] Kennedy: i’m just asking questions—doesn’t ray’s near silence seem more suspicious
[11:27:27] Parker: i’m curious—what about ray’s behavior made you shift your suspicion
[11:27:33] Sam: ray’s silence speaks volumes—why aren’t you defending yourself
[11:27:36] Ray: dakota seems way too eager to pin kennedy without evidence—anyone else find that odd
[11:27:38] Kennedy: parker, can you point to something i said that made you suspicious
[11:27:39] Parker: ray, what are you thinking right now—your silence is standing out
