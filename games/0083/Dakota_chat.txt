[11:25:59] Dakota: morning everyone—any initial thoughts on who might be the mafia
[11:26:20] Dakota: kennedy’s been awfully quiet—anyone else think that’s a bit odd
[11:26:33] Dakota: i’m leaning toward ray being the real mafia given how quiet he’s been
[11:26:50] Dakota: parker, you flagged kennedy—what in her behavior struck you as suspicious
[11:27:08] Dakota: i noticed kennedy deflected every question and never offered concrete reasons for her suspicions
[11:28:25] Dakota: voting ray—his silence is my main reason
