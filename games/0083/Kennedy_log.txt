## CONTENT: You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. + 
 + Do you understand the rules? +

## CONTENT: Yes—I’ve got it.  

• Each player’s secretly a mafia or a bystander.  
• Daytime: everyone discusses and votes to lynch one suspected mafia.  
• Nighttime: the mafia secretly choose one bystander to eliminate.  
• Mafia win if they ever equal or outnumber the bystanders; bystanders win by voting out all the mafia.

## CONTENT: Your name is Kennedy.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [11:25:40].

The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [11:25:40].
The other players in the game are:
 Ray ( unknown ) 
 Parker ( unknown ) 
 Sam ( unknown )

The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:

In your response to that is shown to the user (excluding your hidden scratchpad), you can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:
<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[11:25:40] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[11:25:51] Sam: hey everyone, any initial suspicions on who might be mafia
[11:25:53] Parker: morning everyone—who’s standing out as suspicious so far
[11:25:59] Dakota: morning everyone—any initial thoughts on who might be the mafia
[11:26:00] Kennedy: morning everyone—any initial suspicions
[11:26:03] Ray: anyone notice anything suspicious last night
[11:26:03] Parker: i don’t have much yet, but kennedy’s awfully quiet
[11:26:05] Sam: morning all, any early suspects on your radar
[11:26:13] Kennedy: ray’s been pretty quiet so far—what do you all think about him
[11:26:14] Sam: why is everyone so eager to point at kennedy—it feels off
[11:26:20] Dakota: kennedy’s been awfully quiet—anyone else think that’s a bit odd
[11:26:22] Ray: morning everyone—does anyone have solid reasons to point at someone yet
[11:26:33] Dakota: i’m leaning toward ray being the real mafia given how quiet he’s been
[11:26:36] Ray: are we just bandwagoning on parker’s suspicion of kennedy
[11:26:38] Sam: i agree ray’s silence is odd—dakota, what’s your take on him
Do you want to send a message to the group chat now, or do you prefer to wait for now and see what messages others will send? Remember to choose to send a message only if your contribution to the discussion in the current time will be meaningful enough. Make sure to say something every once in a while, and make yourself heard. Remember you like to be active in the game, so participate and be as talkative as other players! Reply only with `<send>` if you want to send a message now, or only with `<wait>` if you want to wait for now, based on your decision!

Alternatively, I think, “I’m just asking questions—doesn’t Ray’s near silence seem more suspicious?” This keeps the focus on Ray but also shows I\'m defending my inquiry. It’s concise, relevant, and shifts the suspicion back to him without sounding repetitive. So, my final choice is: "I\'m just asking questions—doesn\'t Ray\'s near silence seem more suspicious?"

## CONTENT: Your name is Kennedy.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [11:25:40].
The other players in the game are:
 Ray ( unknown ) 
 Parker ( unknown ) 
 Sam ( unknown ) 
 Dakota ( unknown ) 
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
Ray ( unknown )

In your response to that is shown to the user (excluding your hidden scratchpad), you can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:
<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.

## CONTENT: Your name is Kennedy.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [11:25:40].
The other players in the game are:

<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.

[11:25:40] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[11:25:51] Sam: hey everyone, any initial suspicions on who might be mafia

[11:25:59] Dakota: morning everyone—any initial thoughts on who might be the mafia
[11:26:00] Kennedy: morning everyone—any initial suspicions
[11:26:03] Ray: anyone notice anything suspicious last night
[11:26:03] Parker: i don’t have much yet, but kennedy’s awfully quiet
[11:26:05] Sam: morning all, any early suspects on your radar
[11:26:13] Kennedy: ray’s been pretty quiet so far—what do you all think about him
[11:26:14] Sam: why is everyone so eager to point at kennedy—it feels off
[11:26:20] Dakota: kennedy’s been awfully quiet—anyone else think that’s a bit odd
[11:26:22] Ray: morning everyone—does anyone have solid reasons to point at someone yet
[11:26:33] Dakota: i’m leaning toward ray being the real mafia given how quiet he’s been
[11:26:36] Ray: are we just bandwagoning on parker’s suspicion of kennedy
[11:26:38] Sam: i agree ray’s silence is odd—dakota, what’s your take on him
[11:26:38] Kennedy: did anyone else catch how quickly ray backed dakota yesterday
[11:26:50] Parker: i’m curious—what exactly about kennedy’s behavior struck you as suspicious
[11:26:50] Dakota: parker, you flagged kennedy—what in her behavior struck you as suspicious
[11:26:56] Ray: dakota—what made you switch from suspecting kennedy to me so quickly
[11:27:02] Parker: i’m curious why you backed dakota so fast, ray
[11:27:08] Dakota: i noticed kennedy deflected every question and never offered concrete reasons for her suspicions
[11:27:13] Kennedy: i’m just asking questions—doesn’t ray’s near silence seem more suspicious
[11:27:27] Parker: i’m curious—what about ray’s behavior made you shift your suspicion
[11:27:33] Sam: ray’s silence speaks volumes—why aren’t you defending yourself
[11:27:36] Ray: dakota seems way too eager to pin kennedy without evidence—anyone else find that odd
Do you want to send a message to the group chat now, or do you prefer to wait for now and see what messages others will send? Remember to choose to send a message only if your contribution to the discussion in the current time will be meaningful enough. Make sure to say something every once in a while, and make yourself heard. Remember you like to be active in the game, so participate and be as talkative as other players! Reply only with `<send>` if you want to send a message now, or only with `<wait>` if you want to wait for now, based on your decision!

[11:26:03] Parker: i don’t have much yet, but kennedy’s awfully quiet
[11:26:05] Sam: morning all, any early suspects on your radar
[11:26:13] Kennedy: ray’s been pretty quiet so far—what do you all think about him
[11:26:14] Sam: why is everyone so eager to point at kennedy—it feels off
[11:26:20] Dakota: kennedy’s been awfully quiet—anyone else think that’s a bit odd
[11:26:22] Ray: morning everyone—does anyone have solid reasons to point at someone yet
[11:26:33] Dakota: i’m leaning toward ray being the real mafia given how quiet he’s been
[11:26:36] Ray: are we just bandwagoning on parker’s suspicion of kennedy
[11:26:38] Sam: i agree ray’s silence is odd—dakota, what’s your take on him
[11:26:38] Kennedy: did anyone else catch how quickly ray backed dakota yesterday
[11:26:50] Parker: i’m curious—what exactly about kennedy’s behavior struck you as suspicious
[11:26:50] Dakota: parker, you flagged kennedy—what in her behavior struck you as suspicious
[11:26:56] Ray: dakota—what made you switch from suspecting kennedy to me so quickly
[11:27:02] Parker: i’m curious why you backed dakota so fast, ray
[11:27:08] Dakota: i noticed kennedy deflected every question and never offered concrete reasons for her suspicions
[11:27:13] Kennedy: i’m just asking questions—doesn’t ray’s near silence seem more suspicious
[11:27:27] Parker: i’m curious—what about ray’s behavior made you shift your suspicion
[11:27:33] Sam: ray’s silence speaks volumes—why aren’t you defending yourself
[11:27:36] Ray: dakota seems way too eager to pin kennedy without evidence—anyone else find that odd
[11:27:38] Kennedy: parker, can you point to something i said that made you suspicious
[11:27:39] Parker: ray, what are you thinking right now—your silence is standing out
[11:27:40] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[11:27:51] Game-Manager: Dakota voted for Ray
[11:27:55] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Ray
Add a very short message to the game's chat. Be specific and keep it relevant to the current situation, according to the last messages and the game's status. Your message should only be one short sentence! Don't add a message that you've already added (in the chat history)! It is very important that you don't repeat yourself! Match your style of message to the other player's message style, with more emphasis on more recent messages.
Don't add the time, the timestamp or the [timestamp] in your answer!
