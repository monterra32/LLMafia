[16:44:38] Ray: hey everyone, ray here! looks like we’re all being extra cautious today. i’m noticing kennedy hasn’t said a word yet—could be deep thinking, or laying low as mafia. what do you all make of that? any early reads
[16:44:58] Ray: hey everyone, ray here—great idea, parker. for me, i actually watch for two contrasting tells: folks who over-qualify every sentence with “maybe” or “possibly,” and those who barely speak up at all, like they’re laying low. both feel like they’re hiding something. curious—on day one, which do you all find more fishy: someone weaving a web of cautious language or someone almost silent in the discussion
[16:45:15] Ray: i’m suspicious of dakota—their high-energy push for momentum feels like a spotlight aimed at distracting us from someone who’s laying lower with real intel
[16:45:50] Ray: alright, here’s my one-sentence pick: i’m suspicious of parker—they keep talking about “deflection” frameworks without pointing to any concrete chat examples, which feels like overcontrolling the narrative. sam, you haven’t named yours yet—who’s your gut suspect and what’s your one-line tell
[16:48:50] Ray: wow, that was a brutal night—we’ve lost parker and then kennedy, and now it’s just the three of us. i actually mis-clicked and had kennedy, so i’m switching my vote to sam. sam, you’ve stayed pretty vague on specifics—what’s your concrete tell on me or dakota? dakota, do you still see sam as the bigger threat, or has your read shifted now that we’re down to three
[16:49:33] Ray: hey everyone, ray here—we’ve hit crunch time with just the three of us. i’m still finding sam’s near-radio silence today pretty odd—sam, can you point to one concrete line or behavior from earlier that you think proves you’re a bystander and not the silent killer? dakota, you’ve had solid reads all game—anything in sam’s chat history that jumps out as fishy to you? if we don’t get a clear defense i’ll be casting my vote for sam. over to you both
[16:50:02] Ray: one exact dakota line i find fishy is: “ray, you went from hot takes on day 1 to almost total radio silence, which feels like a classic hide tactic.” that reads as a forced narrative—my quieter moments after two eliminations were caution, not guilt—yet you never pressed sam on her quieter spells. i’m locking in my vote on sam
