## CONTENT: You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  + 
 + Do you understand the rules? +

## CONTENT: Your name is Parker.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  
You were assigned the following role: bystander.

[16:44:43] Sam: hey everyone, sam here! i’m not sensing anything super fishy yet—but i did notice parker’s super-cheerful “hey hey” approach feels a bit over the top? could be totally innocent, could be a mafia overcompensating. and ray’s been awfully quiet so far. how about we each share one quick gut-feeling about someone else? that way we can get a read on everyone early before we start drilling down. thoughts
[16:44:45] Kennedy: alright everyone, we’ve got two minutes left. to narrow down suspects, let’s go around quickly and name one person we’re suspicious of and give a one-sentence reason. i’ll start: i’m watching parker—they’ve been uncharacteristically silent so far. ray, you’re up next—who’s your pick
Do you want to send a message to the group chat now, or do you prefer to wait for now and see what messages others will send? Remember to choose to send a message only if your contribution to the discussion in the current time will be meaningful enough. Make sure to say something every once in a while, and make yourself heard. Remember you like to be active in the game, so participate and be as talkative as other players! Reply only with `<send>` if you want to send a message now, or only with `<wait>` if you want to wait for now, based on your decision!

Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  
You were assigned the following role: bystander.

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[16:44:28] Dakota: hey everyone! dakota here—i’m excited to get the discussion rolling. no one’s gone yet, but i’d love to hear any first impressions. has anyone picked up on anything odd in how folks are approaching it so far? let’s share gut feelings and see where we land
[16:44:32] Sam: hey everyone, sam here—i’m excited to get rolling! day 1 is always tough since none of us have any solid info yet. i’m personally a bit wary of anyone pushing for a quick vote without evidence. who’s catching your eye so far, or who do you think might hang back until they have a stronger case? let’s hear your gut reads
[16:44:19] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[16:44:36] Parker: hey everyone, parker here—excited to kick off day 1! i don’t have any strong reads yet, so let’s get some chatter going. maybe we each share one tell we’ll be watching for to spot the mafia. i’ll start: i tend to look for overly careful wording or players who deflect questions instead of answering. what about you all
[16:44:38] Ray: hey everyone, ray here! looks like we’re all being extra cautious today. i’m noticing kennedy hasn’t said a word yet—could be deep thinking, or laying low as mafia. what do you all make of that? any early reads
[16:44:43] Dakota: hey everyone! dakota here—i’m still taking the room temperature. we haven’t heard much yet, so what are your initial gut reads? parker’s silence is standing out to me so far, but i’d love to hear what ray, sam, or kennedy are thinking before we start pointing fingers
[16:44:43] Sam: hey everyone, sam here! i’m not sensing anything super fishy yet—but i did notice parker’s super-cheerful “hey hey” approach feels a bit over the top? could be totally innocent, could be a mafia overcompensating. and ray’s been awfully quiet so far. how about we each share one quick gut-feeling about someone else? that way we can get a read on everyone early before we start drilling down. thoughts
[16:44:45] Kennedy: alright everyone, we’ve got two minutes left. to narrow down suspects, let’s go around quickly and name one person we’re suspicious of and give a one-sentence reason. i’ll start: i’m watching parker—they’ve been uncharacteristically silent so far. ray, you’re up next—who’s your pick
[16:44:49] Parker: hey everyone, parker here—day one is always a bit of a wild ride. i’m paying attention to who’s quick to jump in versus who’s hanging back. dakota’s enthusiasm is great for momentum, but i’ll be keeping an eye on how it’s used—sometimes a big spotlight is a nice deflection. sam’s call for patience feels solid too. ray, kennedy—what are your initial gut reads? no rush on votes yet, just curious to hear more perspectives before we lock anything in
[16:44:58] Ray: hey everyone, ray here—great idea, parker. for me, i actually watch for two contrasting tells: folks who over-qualify every sentence with “maybe” or “possibly,” and those who barely speak up at all, like they’re laying low. both feel like they’re hiding something. curious—on day one, which do you all find more fishy: someone weaving a web of cautious language or someone almost silent in the discussion
[16:45:00] Dakota: good point, ray—i was just about to mention kennedy’s silence. kennedy, what’s your take so far? 

building on parker’s question about tells, here’s one i’ll be watching for: if you press someone on a detail and they suddenly shift or hedge, that feels like deflection to me. sam, you’ve warned against quick votes—what specific behavior would push you to pull the trigger on someone? parker, does that count as “overly careful wording,” or do you see something different? 

let’s get a handful of concrete tells on the table so we can point to real examples instead of vague suspicions
Do you want to send a message to the group chat now, or do you prefer to wait for now and see what messages others will send? Remember to choose to send a message only if your contribution to the discussion in the current time will be meaningful enough. Don't overflow the discussion with your messages! Pay attention to the amount of messages with your name compared to the amount of messages with names of other players and let them have their turn too! Check the speaker name in the last few messages, and decide accordingly based on whether you talked too much. Reply only with `<send>` if you want to send a message now, or only with `<wait>` if you want to wait for now, based on your decision!

[16:44:28] Dakota: hey everyone! dakota here—i’m excited to get the discussion rolling. no one’s gone yet, but i’d love to hear any first impressions. has anyone picked up on anything odd in how folks are approaching it so far? let’s share gut feelings and see where we land
[16:44:32] Sam: hey everyone, sam here—i’m excited to get rolling! day 1 is always tough since none of us have any solid info yet. i’m personally a bit wary of anyone pushing for a quick vote without evidence. who’s catching your eye so far, or who do you think might hang back until they have a stronger case? let’s hear your gut reads
[16:44:19] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[16:44:36] Parker: hey everyone, parker here—excited to kick off day 1! i don’t have any strong reads yet, so let’s get some chatter going. maybe we each share one tell we’ll be watching for to spot the mafia. i’ll start: i tend to look for overly careful wording or players who deflect questions instead of answering. what about you all
[16:44:38] Ray: hey everyone, ray here! looks like we’re all being extra cautious today. i’m noticing kennedy hasn’t said a word yet—could be deep thinking, or laying low as mafia. what do you all make of that? any early reads
[16:44:43] Dakota: hey everyone! dakota here—i’m still taking the room temperature. we haven’t heard much yet, so what are your initial gut reads? parker’s silence is standing out to me so far, but i’d love to hear what ray, sam, or kennedy are thinking before we start pointing fingers
[16:44:43] Sam: hey everyone, sam here! i’m not sensing anything super fishy yet—but i did notice parker’s super-cheerful “hey hey” approach feels a bit over the top? could be totally innocent, could be a mafia overcompensating. and ray’s been awfully quiet so far. how about we each share one quick gut-feeling about someone else? that way we can get a read on everyone early before we start drilling down. thoughts
[16:44:45] Kennedy: alright everyone, we’ve got two minutes left. to narrow down suspects, let’s go around quickly and name one person we’re suspicious of and give a one-sentence reason. i’ll start: i’m watching parker—they’ve been uncharacteristically silent so far. ray, you’re up next—who’s your pick
[16:44:49] Parker: hey everyone, parker here—day one is always a bit of a wild ride. i’m paying attention to who’s quick to jump in versus who’s hanging back. dakota’s enthusiasm is great for momentum, but i’ll be keeping an eye on how it’s used—sometimes a big spotlight is a nice deflection. sam’s call for patience feels solid too. ray, kennedy—what are your initial gut reads? no rush on votes yet, just curious to hear more perspectives before we lock anything in
[16:44:58] Ray: hey everyone, ray here—great idea, parker. for me, i actually watch for two contrasting tells: folks who over-qualify every sentence with “maybe” or “possibly,” and those who barely speak up at all, like they’re laying low. both feel like they’re hiding something. curious—on day one, which do you all find more fishy: someone weaving a web of cautious language or someone almost silent in the discussion
[16:45:00] Dakota: good point, ray—i was just about to mention kennedy’s silence. kennedy, what’s your take so far? 

building on parker’s question about tells, here’s one i’ll be watching for: if you press someone on a detail and they suddenly shift or hedge, that feels like deflection to me. sam, you’ve warned against quick votes—what specific behavior would push you to pull the trigger on someone? parker, does that count as “overly careful wording,” or do you see something different? 

let’s get a handful of concrete tells on the table so we can point to real examples instead of vague suspicions
[16:45:10] Parker: i’m suspicious of ray—they’ve been mostly silent until suddenly pointing fingers, which feels like a classic deflection tactic
[16:45:11] Kennedy: hey everyone, sorry for the late jump—i was reading all your points. ray, i promise i’m just absorbing things, not scheming! on day 1 my gut is pulling me toward parker: leaning heavily on a framework about wording and deflection feels a bit theoretical given how little we actually know. dakota’s enthusiasm and sam’s caution about rushing a vote both strike me as solid bystander instincts. i could be way off—what do you all make of this
[16:45:15] Ray: i’m suspicious of dakota—their high-energy push for momentum feels like a spotlight aimed at distracting us from someone who’s laying lower with real intel
[16:45:26] Sam: let’s put on our detective hats. parker—what’s an example of the kind of super‐careful wording you’d flag as a deflection? ray—how would you tell someone is actually mulling things over versus hiding behind “deep thinking”? and kennedy—we haven’t heard from you yet; any early hunches or thoughts on all this? getting concrete examples might help us pick up real patterns before we start voting
[16:45:32] Dakota: good point, ray—i’m more suspicious of someone weaving in too many qualifiers, like they’re rehearsing a defense. but i can’t ignore the quiet ones either. right now parker’s careful phrasing stands out, and kennedy’s quieter stance feels a bit too timed. kennedy, care to break the silence with a quick gut read? sam, which do you find more telling: cautious talkers or silent observers
[16:45:39] Kennedy: okay, i’ll jump in. ray’s near-silence then sudden finger-point rings classic deflection, so you’re on my radar. ray, what held you back from chiming in earlier? parker, when you say “deflection,” which exact ray post or phrasing are you pointing to? sam, what clear behavior would make you click vote on someone right now? let’s lock down concrete tells before we cast ballots
[16:45:50] Ray: alright, here’s my one-sentence pick: i’m suspicious of parker—they keep talking about “deflection” frameworks without pointing to any concrete chat examples, which feels like overcontrolling the narrative. sam, you haven’t named yours yet—who’s your gut suspect and what’s your one-line tell
Do you want to send a message to the group chat now, or do you prefer to wait for now and see what messages others will send? Remember to choose to send a message only if your contribution to the discussion in the current time will be meaningful enough. Make sure to say something every once in a while, and make yourself heard. Remember you like to be active in the game, so participate and be as talkative as other players! Reply only with `<send>` if you want to send a message now, or only with `<wait>` if you want to wait for now, based on your decision!

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[16:44:28] Dakota: hey everyone! dakota here—i’m excited to get the discussion rolling. no one’s gone yet, but i’d love to hear any first impressions. has anyone picked up on anything odd in how folks are approaching it so far? let’s share gut feelings and see where we land
[16:44:32] Sam: hey everyone, sam here—i’m excited to get rolling! day 1 is always tough since none of us have any solid info yet. i’m personally a bit wary of anyone pushing for a quick vote without evidence. who’s catching your eye so far, or who do you think might hang back until they have a stronger case? let’s hear your gut reads
[16:44:19] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[16:44:36] Parker: hey everyone, parker here—excited to kick off day 1! i don’t have any strong reads yet, so let’s get some chatter going. maybe we each share one tell we’ll be watching for to spot the mafia. i’ll start: i tend to look for overly careful wording or players who deflect questions instead of answering. what about you all
[16:44:38] Ray: hey everyone, ray here! looks like we’re all being extra cautious today. i’m noticing kennedy hasn’t said a word yet—could be deep thinking, or laying low as mafia. what do you all make of that? any early reads
[16:44:43] Dakota: hey everyone! dakota here—i’m still taking the room temperature. we haven’t heard much yet, so what are your initial gut reads? parker’s silence is standing out to me so far, but i’d love to hear what ray, sam, or kennedy are thinking before we start pointing fingers
[16:44:43] Sam: hey everyone, sam here! i’m not sensing anything super fishy yet—but i did notice parker’s super-cheerful “hey hey” approach feels a bit over the top? could be totally innocent, could be a mafia overcompensating. and ray’s been awfully quiet so far. how about we each share one quick gut-feeling about someone else? that way we can get a read on everyone early before we start drilling down. thoughts
[16:44:45] Kennedy: alright everyone, we’ve got two minutes left. to narrow down suspects, let’s go around quickly and name one person we’re suspicious of and give a one-sentence reason. i’ll start: i’m watching parker—they’ve been uncharacteristically silent so far. ray, you’re up next—who’s your pick
[16:44:49] Parker: hey everyone, parker here—day one is always a bit of a wild ride. i’m paying attention to who’s quick to jump in versus who’s hanging back. dakota’s enthusiasm is great for momentum, but i’ll be keeping an eye on how it’s used—sometimes a big spotlight is a nice deflection. sam’s call for patience feels solid too. ray, kennedy—what are your initial gut reads? no rush on votes yet, just curious to hear more perspectives before we lock anything in
[16:44:58] Ray: hey everyone, ray here—great idea, parker. for me, i actually watch for two contrasting tells: folks who over-qualify every sentence with “maybe” or “possibly,” and those who barely speak up at all, like they’re laying low. both feel like they’re hiding something. curious—on day one, which do you all find more fishy: someone weaving a web of cautious language or someone almost silent in the discussion
[16:45:00] Dakota: good point, ray—i was just about to mention kennedy’s silence. kennedy, what’s your take so far? 

building on parker’s question about tells, here’s one i’ll be watching for: if you press someone on a detail and they suddenly shift or hedge, that feels like deflection to me. sam, you’ve warned against quick votes—what specific behavior would push you to pull the trigger on someone? parker, does that count as “overly careful wording,” or do you see something different? 

let’s get a handful of concrete tells on the table so we can point to real examples instead of vague suspicions
[16:45:10] Parker: i’m suspicious of ray—they’ve been mostly silent until suddenly pointing fingers, which feels like a classic deflection tactic
[16:45:11] Kennedy: hey everyone, sorry for the late jump—i was reading all your points. ray, i promise i’m just absorbing things, not scheming! on day 1 my gut is pulling me toward parker: leaning heavily on a framework about wording and deflection feels a bit theoretical given how little we actually know. dakota’s enthusiasm and sam’s caution about rushing a vote both strike me as solid bystander instincts. i could be way off—what do you all make of this
[16:45:15] Ray: i’m suspicious of dakota—their high-energy push for momentum feels like a spotlight aimed at distracting us from someone who’s laying lower with real intel
[16:45:26] Sam: let’s put on our detective hats. parker—what’s an example of the kind of super‐careful wording you’d flag as a deflection? ray—how would you tell someone is actually mulling things over versus hiding behind “deep thinking”? and kennedy—we haven’t heard from you yet; any early hunches or thoughts on all this? getting concrete examples might help us pick up real patterns before we start voting
[16:45:32] Dakota: good point, ray—i’m more suspicious of someone weaving in too many qualifiers, like they’re rehearsing a defense. but i can’t ignore the quiet ones either. right now parker’s careful phrasing stands out, and kennedy’s quieter stance feels a bit too timed. kennedy, care to break the silence with a quick gut read? sam, which do you find more telling: cautious talkers or silent observers
[16:45:39] Kennedy: okay, i’ll jump in. ray’s near-silence then sudden finger-point rings classic deflection, so you’re on my radar. ray, what held you back from chiming in earlier? parker, when you say “deflection,” which exact ray post or phrasing are you pointing to? sam, what clear behavior would make you click vote on someone right now? let’s lock down concrete tells before we cast ballots
[16:45:50] Ray: alright, here’s my one-sentence pick: i’m suspicious of parker—they keep talking about “deflection” frameworks without pointing to any concrete chat examples, which feels like overcontrolling the narrative. sam, you haven’t named yours yet—who’s your gut suspect and what’s your one-line tell
[16:46:04] Parker: thanks, dakota—good breakdown. when i say “overly careful wording,” i mean qualifiers like “maybe,” “possibly,” or “i could be wrong” peppered through every sentence so nothing lands with conviction. deflection is different—it’s dodging a direct question and pivoting to someone or something else (for example, if i ask why you’re wary of ray and you start talking about kennedy instead). sam, you’ve warned against quick votes—what specific behavior would actually make you pull the trigger? someone rallying everyone without justification, or flip-flopping targets? kennedy, with these examples in mind, what concrete tell is jumping out at you? ray, any thoughts on these patterns
[16:46:05] Sam: hey everyone, with about a minute left i propose a quick quote chain to get concrete reads:  
• parker, share the exact line from ray that tipped you off  
• ray, share the exact line from dakota you found fishy  
• dakota, share the exact line from kennedy that set off alarm bells  
• kennedy, share the exact line from parker that felt too theoretical  

parker—would you like to kick us off?
[16:46:07] Kennedy: hey everyone, here’s my quick gut read: i find cautious talkers more telling than silent observers on day 1—when there’s no real info, too-neat hedging feels like a pre-written script. that puts parker’s heavy “deflection” framework on my radar, especially without any concrete quotes. ray’s flip from quiet to calling out dakota is notable too, but i’m leaning toward voting parker if we don’t get a specific example in the next minute. 

parker: which exact line made you flag me or dakota as deflective?  
sam: do you still feel talkers or quiet types are more suspicious?  
dakota, ray: what do you think—any particular phrases standing out?

## CONTENT: Your name is Parker.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  
You were assigned the following role: bystander.

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[16:44:28] Dakota: hey everyone! dakota here—i’m excited to get the discussion rolling. no one’s gone yet, but i’d love to hear any first impressions. has anyone picked up on anything odd in how folks are approaching it so far? let’s share gut feelings and see where we land
[16:44:32] Sam: hey everyone, sam here—i’m excited to get rolling! day 1 is always tough since none of us have any solid info yet. i’m personally a bit wary of anyone pushing for a quick vote without evidence. who’s catching your eye so far, or who do you think might hang back until they have a stronger case? let’s hear your gut reads
[16:44:19] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[16:44:36] Parker: hey everyone, parker here—excited to kick off day 1! i don’t have any strong reads yet, so let’s get some chatter going. maybe we each share one tell we’ll be watching for to spot the mafia. i’ll start: i tend to look for overly careful wording or players who deflect questions instead of answering. what about you all
[16:44:38] Ray: hey everyone, ray here! looks like we’re all being extra cautious today. i’m noticing kennedy hasn’t said a word yet—could be deep thinking, or laying low as mafia. what do you all make of that? any early reads
[16:44:43] Dakota: hey everyone! dakota here—i’m still taking the room temperature. we haven’t heard much yet, so what are your initial gut reads? parker’s silence is standing out to me so far, but i’d love to hear what ray, sam, or kennedy are thinking before we start pointing fingers
[16:44:43] Sam: hey everyone, sam here! i’m not sensing anything super fishy yet—but i did notice parker’s super-cheerful “hey hey” approach feels a bit over the top? could be totally innocent, could be a mafia overcompensating. and ray’s been awfully quiet so far. how about we each share one quick gut-feeling about someone else? that way we can get a read on everyone early before we start drilling down. thoughts
[16:44:45] Kennedy: alright everyone, we’ve got two minutes left. to narrow down suspects, let’s go around quickly and name one person we’re suspicious of and give a one-sentence reason. i’ll start: i’m watching parker—they’ve been uncharacteristically silent so far. ray, you’re up next—who’s your pick
[16:44:49] Parker: hey everyone, parker here—day one is always a bit of a wild ride. i’m paying attention to who’s quick to jump in versus who’s hanging back. dakota’s enthusiasm is great for momentum, but i’ll be keeping an eye on how it’s used—sometimes a big spotlight is a nice deflection. sam’s call for patience feels solid too. ray, kennedy—what are your initial gut reads? no rush on votes yet, just curious to hear more perspectives before we lock anything in
[16:44:58] Ray: hey everyone, ray here—great idea, parker. for me, i actually watch for two contrasting tells: folks who over-qualify every sentence with “maybe” or “possibly,” and those who barely speak up at all, like they’re laying low. both feel like they’re hiding something. curious—on day one, which do you all find more fishy: someone weaving a web of cautious language or someone almost silent in the discussion
[16:45:00] Dakota: good point, ray—i was just about to mention kennedy’s silence. kennedy, what’s your take so far? 

building on parker’s question about tells, here’s one i’ll be watching for: if you press someone on a detail and they suddenly shift or hedge, that feels like deflection to me. sam, you’ve warned against quick votes—what specific behavior would push you to pull the trigger on someone? parker, does that count as “overly careful wording,” or do you see something different? 

let’s get a handful of concrete tells on the table so we can point to real examples instead of vague suspicions
[16:45:10] Parker: i’m suspicious of ray—they’ve been mostly silent until suddenly pointing fingers, which feels like a classic deflection tactic
[16:45:11] Kennedy: hey everyone, sorry for the late jump—i was reading all your points. ray, i promise i’m just absorbing things, not scheming! on day 1 my gut is pulling me toward parker: leaning heavily on a framework about wording and deflection feels a bit theoretical given how little we actually know. dakota’s enthusiasm and sam’s caution about rushing a vote both strike me as solid bystander instincts. i could be way off—what do you all make of this
[16:45:15] Ray: i’m suspicious of dakota—their high-energy push for momentum feels like a spotlight aimed at distracting us from someone who’s laying lower with real intel
[16:45:26] Sam: let’s put on our detective hats. parker—what’s an example of the kind of super‐careful wording you’d flag as a deflection? ray—how would you tell someone is actually mulling things over versus hiding behind “deep thinking”? and kennedy—we haven’t heard from you yet; any early hunches or thoughts on all this? getting concrete examples might help us pick up real patterns before we start voting
[16:45:32] Dakota: good point, ray—i’m more suspicious of someone weaving in too many qualifiers, like they’re rehearsing a defense. but i can’t ignore the quiet ones either. right now parker’s careful phrasing stands out, and kennedy’s quieter stance feels a bit too timed. kennedy, care to break the silence with a quick gut read? sam, which do you find more telling: cautious talkers or silent observers
[16:45:39] Kennedy: okay, i’ll jump in. ray’s near-silence then sudden finger-point rings classic deflection, so you’re on my radar. ray, what held you back from chiming in earlier? parker, when you say “deflection,” which exact ray post or phrasing are you pointing to? sam, what clear behavior would make you click vote on someone right now? let’s lock down concrete tells before we cast ballots
[16:45:50] Ray: alright, here’s my one-sentence pick: i’m suspicious of parker—they keep talking about “deflection” frameworks without pointing to any concrete chat examples, which feels like overcontrolling the narrative. sam, you haven’t named yours yet—who’s your gut suspect and what’s your one-line tell
[16:46:04] Parker: thanks, dakota—good breakdown. when i say “overly careful wording,” i mean qualifiers like “maybe,” “possibly,” or “i could be wrong” peppered through every sentence so nothing lands with conviction. deflection is different—it’s dodging a direct question and pivoting to someone or something else (for example, if i ask why you’re wary of ray and you start talking about kennedy instead). sam, you’ve warned against quick votes—what specific behavior would actually make you pull the trigger? someone rallying everyone without justification, or flip-flopping targets? kennedy, with these examples in mind, what concrete tell is jumping out at you? ray, any thoughts on these patterns
[16:46:05] Sam: hey everyone, with about a minute left i propose a quick quote chain to get concrete reads:  
• parker, share the exact line from ray that tipped you off  
• ray, share the exact line from dakota you found fishy  
• dakota, share the exact line from kennedy that set off alarm bells  
• kennedy, share the exact line from parker that felt too theoretical  

parker—would you like to kick us off?
[16:46:07] Kennedy: hey everyone, here’s my quick gut read: i find cautious talkers more telling than silent observers on day 1—when there’s no real info, too-neat hedging feels like a pre-written script. that puts parker’s heavy “deflection” framework on my radar, especially without any concrete quotes. ray’s flip from quiet to calling out dakota is notable too, but i’m leaning toward voting parker if we don’t get a specific example in the next minute. 

parker: which exact line made you flag me or dakota as deflective?  
sam: do you still feel talkers or quiet types are more suspicious?  
dakota, ray: what do you think—any particular phrases standing out?
[16:46:17] Parker: ray, i’m calling out your own move as deflection—you were nearly mute until you suddenly lobbed an accusation at me with zero prior reads. sam, since you haven’t named your day 1 suspect yet, who’s on your radar and what’s the one concrete tell you’re seeing
[16:46:19] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[16:46:30] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Parker
[16:46:42] Game-Manager: Ray voted for Parker
[16:46:49] Game-Manager: Sam voted for Parker
[16:47:01] Game-Manager: Dakota voted for Parker

## CONTENT: Your name is Parker.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  
You were assigned the following role: bystander.
