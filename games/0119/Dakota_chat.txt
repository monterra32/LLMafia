[16:44:28] Dakota: hey everyone! dakota here—i’m excited to get the discussion rolling. no one’s gone yet, but i’d love to hear any first impressions. has anyone picked up on anything odd in how folks are approaching it so far? let’s share gut feelings and see where we land
[16:44:43] Dakota: hey everyone! dakota here—i’m still taking the room temperature. we haven’t heard much yet, so what are your initial gut reads? parker’s silence is standing out to me so far, but i’d love to hear what ray, sam, or kennedy are thinking before we start pointing fingers
[16:45:00] Dakota: good point, ray—i was just about to mention kennedy’s silence. kennedy, what’s your take so far? 

building on parker’s question about tells, here’s one i’ll be watching for: if you press someone on a detail and they suddenly shift or hedge, that feels like deflection to me. sam, you’ve warned against quick votes—what specific behavior would push you to pull the trigger on someone? parker, does that count as “overly careful wording,” or do you see something different? 

let’s get a handful of concrete tells on the table so we can point to real examples instead of vague suspicions
[16:45:32] Dakota: good point, ray—i’m more suspicious of someone weaving in too many qualifiers, like they’re rehearsing a defense. but i can’t ignore the quiet ones either. right now parker’s careful phrasing stands out, and kennedy’s quieter stance feels a bit too timed. kennedy, care to break the silence with a quick gut read? sam, which do you find more telling: cautious talkers or silent observers
[16:49:01] Dakota: sad to see kennedy go—she pushed us for hard quotes and probably rattled someone. she flagged both my qualifiers and ray’s sudden finger‐pointing. ray, you went from hot takes on day 1 to almost total radio silence, which feels like a classic hide tactic. sam, you’ve stayed composed and question-focused—could be solid bystander instincts or strategic low-key play. i’m leaning ray right now. over to you both: share one name and a one-sentence tell, then i’ll lock in my vote
[16:49:35] Dakota: dakota: ray, switching your vote to sam because of a claimed “mis-click” on kennedy doesn’t add up—night kills aren’t mis-clicked, it reads like a convenient story to shift suspicion. you haven’t given a single concrete quote to back up why sam or i should be targeted. sam, you’ve flagged flip-flopping and lack of specifics as big red flags—does ray’s sudden vote switch and “mis-click” excuse fit that pattern for you? unless someone can offer a solid defense of ray’s move, i’m locking in my vote for him
[16:50:00] Dakota: ray, your line “if we don’t get a clear defense i’ll be casting my vote for sam” reads like a forced pressure play rather than genuine analysis—especially after you were almost radio silent today, which is classic mafia misdirection. i’m siding with sam’s read and casting my vote on ray
