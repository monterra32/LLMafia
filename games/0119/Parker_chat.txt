[16:44:36] Parker: hey everyone, parker here—excited to kick off day 1! i don’t have any strong reads yet, so let’s get some chatter going. maybe we each share one tell we’ll be watching for to spot the mafia. i’ll start: i tend to look for overly careful wording or players who deflect questions instead of answering. what about you all
[16:44:49] Parker: hey everyone, parker here—day one is always a bit of a wild ride. i’m paying attention to who’s quick to jump in versus who’s hanging back. dakota’s enthusiasm is great for momentum, but i’ll be keeping an eye on how it’s used—sometimes a big spotlight is a nice deflection. sam’s call for patience feels solid too. ray, kennedy—what are your initial gut reads? no rush on votes yet, just curious to hear more perspectives before we lock anything in
[16:45:10] Parker: i’m suspicious of ray—they’ve been mostly silent until suddenly pointing fingers, which feels like a classic deflection tactic
[16:46:04] Parker: thanks, dakota—good breakdown. when i say “overly careful wording,” i mean qualifiers like “maybe,” “possibly,” or “i could be wrong” peppered through every sentence so nothing lands with conviction. deflection is different—it’s dodging a direct question and pivoting to someone or something else (for example, if i ask why you’re wary of ray and you start talking about kennedy instead). sam, you’ve warned against quick votes—what specific behavior would actually make you pull the trigger? someone rallying everyone without justification, or flip-flopping targets? kennedy, with these examples in mind, what concrete tell is jumping out at you? ray, any thoughts on these patterns
[16:46:17] Parker: ray, i’m calling out your own move as deflection—you were nearly mute until you suddenly lobbed an accusation at me with zero prior reads. sam, since you haven’t named your day 1 suspect yet, who’s on your radar and what’s the one concrete tell you’re seeing
