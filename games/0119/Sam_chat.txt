[16:44:32] Sam: hey everyone, sam here—i’m excited to get rolling! day 1 is always tough since none of us have any solid info yet. i’m personally a bit wary of anyone pushing for a quick vote without evidence. who’s catching your eye so far, or who do you think might hang back until they have a stronger case? let’s hear your gut reads
[16:44:43] Sam: hey everyone, sam here! i’m not sensing anything super fishy yet—but i did notice parker’s super-cheerful “hey hey” approach feels a bit over the top? could be totally innocent, could be a mafia overcompensating. and ray’s been awfully quiet so far. how about we each share one quick gut-feeling about someone else? that way we can get a read on everyone early before we start drilling down. thoughts
[16:45:26] Sam: let’s put on our detective hats. parker—what’s an example of the kind of super‐careful wording you’d flag as a deflection? ray—how would you tell someone is actually mulling things over versus hiding behind “deep thinking”? and kennedy—we haven’t heard from you yet; any early hunches or thoughts on all this? getting concrete examples might help us pick up real patterns before we start voting
[16:46:05] Sam: hey everyone, with about a minute left i propose a quick quote chain to get concrete reads:  
• parker, share the exact line from ray that tipped you off  
• ray, share the exact line from dakota you found fishy  
• dakota, share the exact line from kennedy that set off alarm bells  
• kennedy, share the exact line from parker that felt too theoretical  

parker—would you like to kick us off?
[16:49:11] Sam: dakota, ray – it’s down to the three of us with one mafia left. before we vote, let’s lock in concrete reads by quoting exactly what bugs us:

i’ll start: ray, your line “i’m suspicious of dakota—their high-energy push for momentum feels like a spotlight aimed at distracting us” felt like a baseless redirect. 

dakota: which exact ray quote stuck out to you?  
ray: what’s one exact dakota line you find fishy?  

then we can compare patterns and choose who’s really misdirecting us
[16:49:34] Sam: dakota, good breakdown. my vote is on ray—your near-total silence through this day cycle followed by a last-minute, baseless snipe at me feels like classic mafia misdirection. i vote ray
