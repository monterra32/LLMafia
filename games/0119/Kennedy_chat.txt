[16:44:45] Kennedy: alright everyone, we’ve got two minutes left. to narrow down suspects, let’s go around quickly and name one person we’re suspicious of and give a one-sentence reason. i’ll start: i’m watching parker—they’ve been uncharacteristically silent so far. ray, you’re up next—who’s your pick
[16:45:11] Kennedy: hey everyone, sorry for the late jump—i was reading all your points. ray, i promise i’m just absorbing things, not scheming! on day 1 my gut is pulling me toward parker: leaning heavily on a framework about wording and deflection feels a bit theoretical given how little we actually know. dakota’s enthusiasm and sam’s caution about rushing a vote both strike me as solid bystander instincts. i could be way off—what do you all make of this
[16:45:39] Kennedy: okay, i’ll jump in. ray’s near-silence then sudden finger-point rings classic deflection, so you’re on my radar. ray, what held you back from chiming in earlier? parker, when you say “deflection,” which exact ray post or phrasing are you pointing to? sam, what clear behavior would make you click vote on someone right now? let’s lock down concrete tells before we cast ballots
[16:46:07] Kennedy: hey everyone, here’s my quick gut read: i find cautious talkers more telling than silent observers on day 1—when there’s no real info, too-neat hedging feels like a pre-written script. that puts parker’s heavy “deflection” framework on my radar, especially without any concrete quotes. ray’s flip from quiet to calling out dakota is notable too, but i’m leaning toward voting parker if we don’t get a specific example in the next minute. 

parker: which exact line made you flag me or dakota as deflective?  
sam: do you still feel talkers or quiet types are more suspicious?  
dakota, ray: what do you think—any particular phrases standing out?
