[16:42:53] Ray: hey everyone, ray here! day 1 always gets my brain spinning—i’m already overthinking. trying to keep it chill, but i’m curious: what are your gut impressions so far? parker, sam, kennedy, dakota—any odd vibes or stray thoughts? who wants to go first
[16:43:24] Ray: hey everyone—ray here! for my gut feeling, i’m noticing sam hasn’t really chimed in yet. day 1 silence can be a red flag. before we start pointing fingers, sam—what’s on your mind so far? any reads you can share
[16:44:02] Ray: i like dakota’s watchful approach. how about a quick spotlight round—each of us asks one direct question of someone else to see how they react? i’ll kick it off: parker, you’ve been keen on digging for “vibes”—what’s one specific thing someone could say right now that would convince you they’re a genuine bystander? then we’ll rotate. sound good
[16:44:22] Ray: i’m putting sam on my gut-sus list for now
[16:46:14] Ray: hey kennedy, dakota—tough seeing parker and sam go so fast. now it’s down to the three of us, so let’s get concrete: let’s each drop one suspect with one specific behavior that set off alarm bells (keep it to one sentence), then vote. kennedy, you first—who’s your top sus and why
[16:47:06] Ray: alright kennedy and dakota, with parker and sam gone it’s down to us three. i’m voting kennedy—your day 1 push to structure us, then near radio silence feels off. dakota, who are you voting and why? kennedy, last chance to explain before we lock it in
