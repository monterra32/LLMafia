[16:42:42] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! since we’re all starting from scratch, how about we go around and share any gut feelings? no one’s said a word yet, so i don’t have any solid suspicions—but i’d love to hear your first impressions. sam, parker, dakota, ray—what’s on your minds so far
[16:43:10] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! since it’s day 1 and no one’s been eliminated yet, we’re flying blind. i’d love if we each shared any gut feelings—even if it’s just “i’m not sure yet.” i’m personally watching for both people who stay too quiet and those who try to steer us too aggressively. ray, want to kick us off with your take
[16:44:07] Kennedy: thanks for the thoughts, dakota and parker. i’m seeing a pattern where parker’s echoing dakota feels safe, but ray and sam have been pretty quiet—could just be first-day nerves, or flying low. sam, since you mentioned defensiveness, what’s a red flag you look for in someone pretending to be helpful? ray, do you think parker is genuinely building on dakota’s points or steering the convo? let’s get some back-and-forth so we can see who shifts under the spotlight
[16:46:17] Kennedy: hey everyone—day 2’s here. with sam gone, it’s the three of us now: one mafia, two bystanders. let’s do a quick gut-round: each of us names who we’re leaning on and one specific behavior that tips us off. i’ll start: i’m leaning toward ray—he stayed extra quiet all day then suddenly pinned sam at the end. dakota, who’s on your radar now? ray, you’re up next
[16:46:43] Kennedy: kennedy: i’m most suspicious of ray—he’s been asking probing questions but never committing to any concrete reads, which feels like a classic low-key mafia tactic. voting ray
[16:47:09] Kennedy: i see the kill of sam—our main pattern‐spotter—as a move to silence analysis, and ray’s instant leap on sam smells like a prepared deflection rather than genuine doubt, so i’m still most suspicious of ray. ray, how do you justify zero reads all day and then suddenly targeting sam if you weren’t ready to steer the heat off yourself
