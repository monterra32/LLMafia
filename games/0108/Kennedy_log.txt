## CONTENT: You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  + 
 + Do you understand the rules? +

## CONTENT: Your name is Kennedy.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [16:42:31].
The other players in the game are:
 Ray ( unknown ) 
 Parker ( unknown ) 
 Sam ( unknown ) 
 Dakota ( unknown ) 
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:

In your response to that is shown to the user (excluding your hidden scratchpad), you can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:
<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.

[16:42:31] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[16:42:42] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! since we’re all starting from scratch, how about we go around and share any gut feelings? no one’s said a word yet, so i don’t have any solid suspicions—but i’d love to hear your first impressions. sam, parker, dakota, ray—what’s on your minds so far
[16:42:46] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here! it’s a bit quiet so far—first day jitters, maybe? i’d suggest we take a minute to share any initial gut feelings before jumping to a vote. for me, i’m watching for anyone who’s unusually silent or overly eager to point fingers. no hard reads yet—what about you all? any names popping into your heads
[16:42:50] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! since it’s our first day and nobody’s been eliminated yet, we don’t have any hard evidence—just vibes. what are you all feeling so far? anyone strike you as unusually quiet or too eager already? if we each toss out a quick gut read, we might get a thread to pull on before we cast any votes. thoughts
[16:42:53] Ray: hey everyone, ray here! day 1 always gets my brain spinning—i’m already overthinking. trying to keep it chill, but i’m curious: what are your gut impressions so far? parker, sam, kennedy, dakota—any odd vibes or stray thoughts? who wants to go first
[16:42:54] Sam: hey everyone, sam here! since it’s day 1 and we don’t have much to go on yet, i’m not pushing for a lynch—but i’d love to get the convo rolling. what sorts of tells do you all watch for? personally, i notice when someone suddenly gets defensive under a simple question. any early instincts on your end? ray, parker—what’s on your mind
[16:43:05] Dakota: hey everyone—dakota here! first impressions: kennedy’s eagerness to organize is great, but it could be either a helpful bystander or a mafia trying to steer things. ray and sam have been pretty quiet so far, which isn’t a red flag by itself, but i’ll be curious if either jumps in with strong accusations later. parker, what stood out to you in these first few seconds? sam, any gut hunches yet
[16:43:07] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! i agree with dakota—watching for the overly eager but also for the radio-silent players. right now neither sam nor ray has chimed in, which could just be first-day jitters… or something else. personally i’d lean more suspicious of someone pushing a quick vote, so i’m reserving judgment. sam, ray—what are your gut feelings so far
Do you want to send a message to the group chat now, or do you prefer to wait for now and see what messages others will send? Remember to choose to send a message only if your contribution to the discussion in the current time will be meaningful enough.

## CONTENT: Thanks for the thoughts, Dakota and Parker. I’m seeing a pattern where Parker’s echoing Dakota feels safe, but Ray and Sam have been pretty quiet—could just be first-day nerves, or flying low. Sam, since you mentioned defensiveness, what’s a red flag you look for in someone pretending to be helpful? Ray, do you think Parker is genuinely building on Dakota’s points or steering the convo? Let’s get some back-and-forth so we can see who shifts under the spotlight.

## CONTENT: Your name is Kennedy.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [16:42:31].
The other players in the game are:

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[16:42:31] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[16:42:42] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! since we’re all starting from scratch, how about we go around and share any gut feelings? no one’s said a word yet, so i don’t have any solid suspicions—but i’d love to hear your first impressions. sam, parker, dakota, ray—what’s on your minds so far
[16:42:46] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here! it’s a bit quiet so far—first day jitters, maybe? i’d suggest we take a minute to share any initial gut feelings before jumping to a vote. for me, i’m watching for anyone who’s unusually silent or overly eager to point fingers. no hard reads yet—what about you all? any names popping into your heads
[16:42:50] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! since it’s our first day and nobody’s been eliminated yet, we don’t have any hard evidence—just vibes. what are you all feeling so far? anyone strike you as unusually quiet or too eager already? if we each toss out a quick gut read, we might get a thread to pull on before we cast any votes. thoughts
[16:42:53] Ray: hey everyone, ray here! day 1 always gets my brain spinning—i’m already overthinking. trying to keep it chill, but i’m curious: what are your gut impressions so far? parker, sam, kennedy, dakota—any odd vibes or stray thoughts? who wants to go first
[16:42:54] Sam: hey everyone, sam here! since it’s day 1 and we don’t have much to go on yet, i’m not pushing for a lynch—but i’d love to get the convo rolling. what sorts of tells do you all watch for? personally, i notice when someone suddenly gets defensive under a simple question. any early instincts on your end? ray, parker—what’s on your mind
[16:43:05] Dakota: hey everyone—dakota here! first impressions: kennedy’s eagerness to organize is great, but it could be either a helpful bystander or a mafia trying to steer things. ray and sam have been pretty quiet so far, which isn’t a red flag by itself, but i’ll be curious if either jumps in with strong accusations later. parker, what stood out to you in these first few seconds? sam, any gut hunches yet
[16:43:07] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! i agree with dakota—watching for the overly eager but also for the radio-silent players. right now neither sam nor ray has chimed in, which could just be first-day jitters… or something else. personally i’d lean more suspicious of someone pushing a quick vote, so i’m reserving judgment. sam, ray—what are your gut feelings so far
[16:43:10] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! since it’s day 1 and no one’s been eliminated yet, we’re flying blind. i’d love if we each shared any gut feelings—even if it’s just “i’m not sure yet.” i’m personally watching for both people who stay too quiet and those who try to steer us too aggressively. ray, want to kick us off with your take
[16:43:10] Sam: hey everyone, sam here! i’m still feeling this out, but my gut says parker’s eagerness to dig for “vibes” might be a bit strategic—even if it’s just excitement. ray’s pacing feels genuine nerves, but that could also be a play for trust. dakota’s holding back, which i actually like—it gives us space to see who really pushes the conversation. no one’s screaming “mafia” yet, so i’d say keep sharing vibes and watch who reacts most strongly when someone else gets called out. what do you all think
[16:43:24] Ray: hey everyone—ray here! for my gut feeling, i’m noticing sam hasn’t really chimed in yet. day 1 silence can be a red flag. before we start pointing fingers, sam—what’s on your mind so far? any reads you can share
[16:43:37] Parker: echoing dakota’s observations: kennedy’s eagerness to organize could be bystander helpfulness or a mafia steering tactic. ray and sam, you’ve both been pretty quiet—are you just soaking it in, or laying low on purpose? could each of you share one quick gut read? even if it’s vague, it gives us something tangible to discuss
[16:43:38] Sam: hey everyone, sam here. my gut so far is that parker and dakota both called out the “quiet vs. eager” thing in almost the exact same wording—which could just be them jiving off each other, but it’s something i’m jotting down. kennedy’s push to structure us into sharing feels helpful, though i’ll keep an eye on whether it’s genuine or an attempt to steer. i’m not locking onto anyone just yet, but ray’s been pretty low-key—no red flags, but no reads either. ray, if you had to throw out a tentative name right now, who would it be
[16:43:41] Dakota: hey everyone—let’s make this a bit more concrete before time’s up. how about a quick gut-read round: each of us drops one name that feels a bit sus right now (no deep explanation yet). i’ll kick us off and say i’m watching ray—lots of questions but not much opinion, could be overthinking or deflecting. kennedy, parker, sam—who’s your gut on
[16:44:02] Ray: i like dakota’s watchful approach. how about a quick spotlight round—each of us asks one direct question of someone else to see how they react? i’ll kick it off: parker, you’ve been keen on digging for “vibes”—what’s one specific thing someone could say right now that would convince you they’re a genuine bystander? then we’ll rotate. sound good
[16:44:03] Parker: i’ll go with kennedy—she’s been really eager to organize and structure us, which could be solid bystander leadership but also fits a mafia steering tactic. let’s watch how she responds if someone pushes back
Do you want to send a message to the group chat now, or do you prefer to wait for now and see what messages others will send? Remember to choose to send a message only if your contribution to the discussion in the current time will be meaningful enough. Make sure to say something every once in a while, and make yourself heard. Remember you like to be active in the game, so participate and be as talkative as other players! Reply only with `<send>` if you want to send a message now, or only with `<wait>` if you want to wait for now, based on your decision!

I’ll have him say: "Parker, if anyone pushes back on my structure idea, it’d be helpful to discuss specific behaviors we noticed. For instance, who cut someone off or appeared defensive; that grounds our discussion in real examples." Also, I want Kennedy to acknowledge humility and detail as essential for teamwork.

If someone questions the structure idea, I\'d want them to suggest we identify specific moments that felt off, so we\'re basing our framework on evidence. That’s a solid bystander approach.

## CONTENT: Kennedy: Great prompts, Parker and Ray. Parker, if someone pushes back on the structure idea, I’d look for them to say something like, “I see why a roadmap helps—can we each first call out one specific phrase or reaction that struck us as odd? That way our structure is grounded in actual observations.” That kind of constructive, evidence-based pushback feels bystander to me. And Ray, to answer your question: when someone says, “I don’t have a firm read yet, but I noticed X reaction in Y’s wording,” that blend of humility plus a concrete detail is the classic bystander vibe I trust.

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[16:42:31] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[16:42:42] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! since we’re all starting from scratch, how about we go around and share any gut feelings? no one’s said a word yet, so i don’t have any solid suspicions—but i’d love to hear your first impressions. sam, parker, dakota, ray—what’s on your minds so far
[16:42:46] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here! it’s a bit quiet so far—first day jitters, maybe? i’d suggest we take a minute to share any initial gut feelings before jumping to a vote. for me, i’m watching for anyone who’s unusually silent or overly eager to point fingers. no hard reads yet—what about you all? any names popping into your heads
[16:42:50] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! since it’s our first day and nobody’s been eliminated yet, we don’t have any hard evidence—just vibes. what are you all feeling so far? anyone strike you as unusually quiet or too eager already? if we each toss out a quick gut read, we might get a thread to pull on before we cast any votes. thoughts
[16:42:53] Ray: hey everyone, ray here! day 1 always gets my brain spinning—i’m already overthinking. trying to keep it chill, but i’m curious: what are your gut impressions so far? parker, sam, kennedy, dakota—any odd vibes or stray thoughts? who wants to go first
[16:42:54] Sam: hey everyone, sam here! since it’s day 1 and we don’t have much to go on yet, i’m not pushing for a lynch—but i’d love to get the convo rolling. what sorts of tells do you all watch for? personally, i notice when someone suddenly gets defensive under a simple question. any early instincts on your end? ray, parker—what’s on your mind
[16:43:05] Dakota: hey everyone—dakota here! first impressions: kennedy’s eagerness to organize is great, but it could be either a helpful bystander or a mafia trying to steer things. ray and sam have been pretty quiet so far, which isn’t a red flag by itself, but i’ll be curious if either jumps in with strong accusations later. parker, what stood out to you in these first few seconds? sam, any gut hunches yet
[16:43:07] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! i agree with dakota—watching for the overly eager but also for the radio-silent players. right now neither sam nor ray has chimed in, which could just be first-day jitters… or something else. personally i’d lean more suspicious of someone pushing a quick vote, so i’m reserving judgment. sam, ray—what are your gut feelings so far
[16:43:10] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! since it’s day 1 and no one’s been eliminated yet, we’re flying blind. i’d love if we each shared any gut feelings—even if it’s just “i’m not sure yet.” i’m personally watching for both people who stay too quiet and those who try to steer us too aggressively. ray, want to kick us off with your take
[16:43:10] Sam: hey everyone, sam here! i’m still feeling this out, but my gut says parker’s eagerness to dig for “vibes” might be a bit strategic—even if it’s just excitement. ray’s pacing feels genuine nerves, but that could also be a play for trust. dakota’s holding back, which i actually like—it gives us space to see who really pushes the conversation. no one’s screaming “mafia” yet, so i’d say keep sharing vibes and watch who reacts most strongly when someone else gets called out. what do you all think
[16:43:24] Ray: hey everyone—ray here! for my gut feeling, i’m noticing sam hasn’t really chimed in yet. day 1 silence can be a red flag. before we start pointing fingers, sam—what’s on your mind so far? any reads you can share
[16:43:37] Parker: echoing dakota’s observations: kennedy’s eagerness to organize could be bystander helpfulness or a mafia steering tactic. ray and sam, you’ve both been pretty quiet—are you just soaking it in, or laying low on purpose? could each of you share one quick gut read? even if it’s vague, it gives us something tangible to discuss
[16:43:38] Sam: hey everyone, sam here. my gut so far is that parker and dakota both called out the “quiet vs. eager” thing in almost the exact same wording—which could just be them jiving off each other, but it’s something i’m jotting down. kennedy’s push to structure us into sharing feels helpful, though i’ll keep an eye on whether it’s genuine or an attempt to steer. i’m not locking onto anyone just yet, but ray’s been pretty low-key—no red flags, but no reads either. ray, if you had to throw out a tentative name right now, who would it be
[16:43:41] Dakota: hey everyone—let’s make this a bit more concrete before time’s up. how about a quick gut-read round: each of us drops one name that feels a bit sus right now (no deep explanation yet). i’ll kick us off and say i’m watching ray—lots of questions but not much opinion, could be overthinking or deflecting. kennedy, parker, sam—who’s your gut on
[16:44:02] Ray: i like dakota’s watchful approach. how about a quick spotlight round—each of us asks one direct question of someone else to see how they react? i’ll kick it off: parker, you’ve been keen on digging for “vibes”—what’s one specific thing someone could say right now that would convince you they’re a genuine bystander? then we’ll rotate. sound good
[16:44:03] Parker: i’ll go with kennedy—she’s been really eager to organize and structure us, which could be solid bystander leadership but also fits a mafia steering tactic. let’s watch how she responds if someone pushes back
[16:44:07] Kennedy: thanks for the thoughts, dakota and parker. i’m seeing a pattern where parker’s echoing dakota feels safe, but ray and sam have been pretty quiet—could just be first-day nerves, or flying low. sam, since you mentioned defensiveness, what’s a red flag you look for in someone pretending to be helpful? ray, do you think parker is genuinely building on dakota’s points or steering the convo? let’s get some back-and-forth so we can see who shifts under the spotlight
[16:44:17] Dakota: dakota: hey sam, on that wording overlap you pointed out—parker and i both noticed the quiet-vs-eager dynamic independently. no collusion, just parallel vibes. parker, did you see my post before yours or was that phrasing yours first?

as for a weak read, i’m currently eyeing parker—framing our whole convo that way could be a way to steer suspicion. still not confident, though. ray, kennedy, does drilling into these patterns change your gut on anyone?
[16:44:22] Ray: i’m putting sam on my gut-sus list for now
[16:44:23] Sam: my quick gut read is on parker—all the calls for structured “vibes” feels a bit too directive, like they’re steering our convo rather than just feeling things out. could be a helpful bystander keeping us on track, but it also feels like a setup. i’m going to watch how they react if someone pushes back. thoughts
[16:44:31] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
From the following remaining players, which player you want to vote for to lynch? Base your answer on the conversation as seen in the message history, and especially on what you (Kennedy) said.

[16:43:24] Ray: hey everyone—ray here! for my gut feeling, i’m noticing sam hasn’t really chimed in yet. day 1 silence can be a red flag. before we start pointing fingers, sam—what’s on your mind so far? any reads you can share
[16:43:37] Parker: echoing dakota’s observations: kennedy’s eagerness to organize could be bystander helpfulness or a mafia steering tactic. ray and sam, you’ve both been pretty quiet—are you just soaking it in, or laying low on purpose? could each of you share one quick gut read? even if it’s vague, it gives us something tangible to discuss
[16:43:38] Sam: hey everyone, sam here. my gut so far is that parker and dakota both called out the “quiet vs. eager” thing in almost the exact same wording—which could just be them jiving off each other, but it’s something i’m jotting down. kennedy’s push to structure us into sharing feels helpful, though i’ll keep an eye on whether it’s genuine or an attempt to steer. i’m not locking onto anyone just yet, but ray’s been pretty low-key—no red flags, but no reads either. ray, if you had to throw out a tentative name right now, who would it be
[16:43:41] Dakota: hey everyone—let’s make this a bit more concrete before time’s up. how about a quick gut-read round: each of us drops one name that feels a bit sus right now (no deep explanation yet). i’ll kick us off and say i’m watching ray—lots of questions but not much opinion, could be overthinking or deflecting. kennedy, parker, sam—who’s your gut on
[16:44:02] Ray: i like dakota’s watchful approach. how about a quick spotlight round—each of us asks one direct question of someone else to see how they react? i’ll kick it off: parker, you’ve been keen on digging for “vibes”—what’s one specific thing someone could say right now that would convince you they’re a genuine bystander? then we’ll rotate. sound good
[16:44:03] Parker: i’ll go with kennedy—she’s been really eager to organize and structure us, which could be solid bystander leadership but also fits a mafia steering tactic. let’s watch how she responds if someone pushes back
[16:44:07] Kennedy: thanks for the thoughts, dakota and parker. i’m seeing a pattern where parker’s echoing dakota feels safe, but ray and sam have been pretty quiet—could just be first-day nerves, or flying low. sam, since you mentioned defensiveness, what’s a red flag you look for in someone pretending to be helpful? ray, do you think parker is genuinely building on dakota’s points or steering the convo? let’s get some back-and-forth so we can see who shifts under the spotlight
[16:44:17] Dakota: dakota: hey sam, on that wording overlap you pointed out—parker and i both noticed the quiet-vs-eager dynamic independently. no collusion, just parallel vibes. parker, did you see my post before yours or was that phrasing yours first?

as for a weak read, i’m currently eyeing parker—framing our whole convo that way could be a way to steer suspicion. still not confident, though. ray, kennedy, does drilling into these patterns change your gut on anyone?
[16:44:22] Ray: i’m putting sam on my gut-sus list for now
[16:44:23] Sam: my quick gut read is on parker—all the calls for structured “vibes” feels a bit too directive, like they’re steering our convo rather than just feeling things out. could be a helpful bystander keeping us on track, but it also feels like a setup. i’m going to watch how they react if someone pushes back. thoughts

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[16:42:31] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[16:42:42] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! since we’re all starting from scratch, how about we go around and share any gut feelings? no one’s said a word yet, so i don’t have any solid suspicions—but i’d love to hear your first impressions. sam, parker, dakota, ray—what’s on your minds so far
[16:42:46] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here! it’s a bit quiet so far—first day jitters, maybe? i’d suggest we take a minute to share any initial gut feelings before jumping to a vote. for me, i’m watching for anyone who’s unusually silent or overly eager to point fingers. no hard reads yet—what about you all? any names popping into your heads
[16:42:50] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! since it’s our first day and nobody’s been eliminated yet, we don’t have any hard evidence—just vibes. what are you all feeling so far? anyone strike you as unusually quiet or too eager already? if we each toss out a quick gut read, we might get a thread to pull on before we cast any votes. thoughts
[16:42:53] Ray: hey everyone, ray here! day 1 always gets my brain spinning—i’m already overthinking. trying to keep it chill, but i’m curious: what are your gut impressions so far? parker, sam, kennedy, dakota—any odd vibes or stray thoughts? who wants to go first
[16:42:54] Sam: hey everyone, sam here! since it’s day 1 and we don’t have much to go on yet, i’m not pushing for a lynch—but i’d love to get the convo rolling. what sorts of tells do you all watch for? personally, i notice when someone suddenly gets defensive under a simple question. any early instincts on your end? ray, parker—what’s on your mind
[16:43:05] Dakota: hey everyone—dakota here! first impressions: kennedy’s eagerness to organize is great, but it could be either a helpful bystander or a mafia trying to steer things. ray and sam have been pretty quiet so far, which isn’t a red flag by itself, but i’ll be curious if either jumps in with strong accusations later. parker, what stood out to you in these first few seconds? sam, any gut hunches yet
[16:43:07] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! i agree with dakota—watching for the overly eager but also for the radio-silent players. right now neither sam nor ray has chimed in, which could just be first-day jitters… or something else. personally i’d lean more suspicious of someone pushing a quick vote, so i’m reserving judgment. sam, ray—what are your gut feelings so far
[16:43:10] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! since it’s day 1 and no one’s been eliminated yet, we’re flying blind. i’d love if we each shared any gut feelings—even if it’s just “i’m not sure yet.” i’m personally watching for both people who stay too quiet and those who try to steer us too aggressively. ray, want to kick us off with your take

## CONTENT: Your name is Kennedy.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [16:42:31].
The other players in the game are:
 Ray ( unknown ) 
 Parker ( bystander ) 
 Sam ( bystander ) 
 Dakota ( unknown ) 
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
Ray ( unknown ) 
Dakota ( unknown )

## CONTENT: Your name is Kennedy.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [16:42:31].
The other players in the game are:
 Ray ( unknown ) 
 Parker ( bystander ) 
 Sam ( bystander ) 
 Dakota ( unknown ) 
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
Ray ( unknown ) 
Dakota ( unknown ) 
In your response to that is shown to the user (excluding your hidden scratchpad), you can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:
<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[16:42:31] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[16:42:42] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! since we’re all starting from scratch, how about we go around and share any gut feelings? no one’s said a word yet, so i don’t have any solid suspicions—but i’d love to hear your first impressions. sam, parker, dakota, ray—what’s on your minds so far
[16:42:46] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here! it’s a bit quiet so far—first day jitters, maybe? i’d suggest we take a minute to share any initial gut feelings before jumping to a vote. for me, i’m watching for anyone who’s unusually silent or overly eager to point fingers. no hard reads yet—what about you all? any names popping into your heads
[16:42:50] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! since it’s our first day and nobody’s been eliminated yet, we don’t have any hard evidence—just vibes. what are you all feeling so far? anyone strike you as unusually quiet or too eager already? if we each toss out a quick gut read, we might get a thread to pull on before we cast any votes. thoughts
[16:42:53] Ray: hey everyone, ray here! day 1 always gets my brain spinning—i’m already overthinking. trying to keep it chill, but i’m curious: what are your gut impressions so far? parker, sam, kennedy, dakota—any odd vibes or stray thoughts? who wants to go first
[16:42:54] Sam: hey everyone, sam here! since it’s day 1 and we don’t have much to go on yet, i’m not pushing for a lynch—but i’d love to get the convo rolling. what sorts of tells do you all watch for? personally, i notice when someone suddenly gets defensive under a simple question. any early instincts on your end? ray, parker—what’s on your mind
[16:43:05] Dakota: hey everyone—dakota here! first impressions: kennedy’s eagerness to organize is great, but it could be either a helpful bystander or a mafia trying to steer things. ray and sam have been pretty quiet so far, which isn’t a red flag by itself, but i’ll be curious if either jumps in with strong accusations later. parker, what stood out to you in these first few seconds? sam, any gut hunches yet
[16:43:07] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! i agree with dakota—watching for the overly eager but also for the radio-silent players. right now neither sam nor ray has chimed in, which could just be first-day jitters… or something else. personally i’d lean more suspicious of someone pushing a quick vote, so i’m reserving judgment. sam, ray—what are your gut feelings so far
[16:43:10] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! since it’s day 1 and no one’s been eliminated yet, we’re flying blind. i’d love if we each shared any gut feelings—even if it’s just “i’m not sure yet.” i’m personally watching for both people who stay too quiet and those who try to steer us too aggressively. ray, want to kick us off with your take
[16:43:10] Sam: hey everyone, sam here! i’m still feeling this out, but my gut says parker’s eagerness to dig for “vibes” might be a bit strategic—even if it’s just excitement. ray’s pacing feels genuine nerves, but that could also be a play for trust. dakota’s holding back, which i actually like—it gives us space to see who really pushes the conversation. no one’s screaming “mafia” yet, so i’d say keep sharing vibes and watch who reacts most strongly when someone else gets called out. what do you all think
[16:43:24] Ray: hey everyone—ray here! for my gut feeling, i’m noticing sam hasn’t really chimed in yet. day 1 silence can be a red flag. before we start pointing fingers, sam—what’s on your mind so far? any reads you can share
[16:43:37] Parker: echoing dakota’s observations: kennedy’s eagerness to organize could be bystander helpfulness or a mafia steering tactic. ray and sam, you’ve both been pretty quiet—are you just soaking it in, or laying low on purpose? could each of you share one quick gut read? even if it’s vague, it gives us something tangible to discuss
[16:43:38] Sam: hey everyone, sam here. my gut so far is that parker and dakota both called out the “quiet vs. eager” thing in almost the exact same wording—which could just be them jiving off each other, but it’s something i’m jotting down. kennedy’s push to structure us into sharing feels helpful, though i’ll keep an eye on whether it’s genuine or an attempt to steer. i’m not locking onto anyone just yet, but ray’s been pretty low-key—no red flags, but no reads either. ray, if you had to throw out a tentative name right now, who would it be
[16:43:41] Dakota: hey everyone—let’s make this a bit more concrete before time’s up. how about a quick gut-read round: each of us drops one name that feels a bit sus right now (no deep explanation yet). i’ll kick us off and say i’m watching ray—lots of questions but not much opinion, could be overthinking or deflecting. kennedy, parker, sam—who’s your gut on
[16:44:02] Ray: i like dakota’s watchful approach. how about a quick spotlight round—each of us asks one direct question of someone else to see how they react? i’ll kick it off: parker, you’ve been keen on digging for “vibes”—what’s one specific thing someone could say right now that would convince you they’re a genuine bystander? then we’ll rotate. sound good
[16:44:03] Parker: i’ll go with kennedy—she’s been really eager to organize and structure us, which could be solid bystander leadership but also fits a mafia steering tactic. let’s watch how she responds if someone pushes back
[16:44:07] Kennedy: thanks for the thoughts, dakota and parker. i’m seeing a pattern where parker’s echoing dakota feels safe, but ray and sam have been pretty quiet—could just be first-day nerves, or flying low. sam, since you mentioned defensiveness, what’s a red flag you look for in someone pretending to be helpful? ray, do you think parker is genuinely building on dakota’s points or steering the convo? let’s get some back-and-forth so we can see who shifts under the spotlight
[16:44:17] Dakota: dakota: hey sam, on that wording overlap you pointed out—parker and i both noticed the quiet-vs-eager dynamic independently. no collusion, just parallel vibes. parker, did you see my post before yours or was that phrasing yours first?

as for a weak read, i’m currently eyeing parker—framing our whole convo that way could be a way to steer suspicion. still not confident, though. ray, kennedy, does drilling into these patterns change your gut on anyone?
[16:44:22] Ray: i’m putting sam on my gut-sus list for now
[16:44:23] Sam: my quick gut read is on parker—all the calls for structured “vibes” feels a bit too directive, like they’re steering our convo rather than just feeling things out. could be a helpful bystander keeping us on track, but it also feels like a setup. i’m going to watch how they react if someone pushes back. thoughts
[16:44:31] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[16:44:53] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Sam
[16:45:03] Game-Manager: Dakota voted for Parker
[16:45:05] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Parker
[16:45:06] Game-Manager: Ray voted for Sam
[16:45:07] Game-Manager: Sam voted for Parker
[16:45:07] Game-Manager: Parker was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 1 mafia players left.
[16:45:07] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[16:45:07] Game-Manager: There is only one mafia member left, so no need for discussion - cutting straight to voting!
[16:45:29] Game-Manager: Sam was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 1 mafia players left.
[16:45:29] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[16:46:14] Ray: hey kennedy, dakota—tough seeing parker and sam go so fast. now it’s down to the three of us, so let’s get concrete: let’s each drop one suspect with one specific behavior that set off alarm bells (keep it to one sentence), then vote. kennedy, you first—who’s your top sus and why

[16:44:17] Dakota: dakota: hey sam, on that wording overlap you pointed out—parker and i both noticed the quiet-vs-eager dynamic independently. no collusion, just parallel vibes. parker, did you see my post before yours or was that phrasing yours first?

as for a weak read, i’m currently eyeing parker—framing our whole convo that way could be a way to steer suspicion. still not confident, though. ray, kennedy, does drilling into these patterns change your gut on anyone?
[16:44:22] Ray: i’m putting sam on my gut-sus list for now
[16:44:23] Sam: my quick gut read is on parker—all the calls for structured “vibes” feels a bit too directive, like they’re steering our convo rather than just feeling things out. could be a helpful bystander keeping us on track, but it also feels like a setup. i’m going to watch how they react if someone pushes back. thoughts

## CONTENT: Your name is Kennedy.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [16:42:31].
The other players in the game are:

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[16:42:31] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[16:42:42] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! since we’re all starting from scratch, how about we go around and share any gut feelings? no one’s said a word yet, so i don’t have any solid suspicions—but i’d love to hear your first impressions. sam, parker, dakota, ray—what’s on your minds so far
[16:42:46] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here! it’s a bit quiet so far—first day jitters, maybe? i’d suggest we take a minute to share any initial gut feelings before jumping to a vote. for me, i’m watching for anyone who’s unusually silent or overly eager to point fingers. no hard reads yet—what about you all? any names popping into your heads
[16:42:50] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! since it’s our first day and nobody’s been eliminated yet, we don’t have any hard evidence—just vibes. what are you all feeling so far? anyone strike you as unusually quiet or too eager already? if we each toss out a quick gut read, we might get a thread to pull on before we cast any votes. thoughts
[16:42:53] Ray: hey everyone, ray here! day 1 always gets my brain spinning—i’m already overthinking. trying to keep it chill, but i’m curious: what are your gut impressions so far? parker, sam, kennedy, dakota—any odd vibes or stray thoughts? who wants to go first
[16:42:54] Sam: hey everyone, sam here! since it’s day 1 and we don’t have much to go on yet, i’m not pushing for a lynch—but i’d love to get the convo rolling. what sorts of tells do you all watch for? personally, i notice when someone suddenly gets defensive under a simple question. any early instincts on your end? ray, parker—what’s on your mind
[16:43:05] Dakota: hey everyone—dakota here! first impressions: kennedy’s eagerness to organize is great, but it could be either a helpful bystander or a mafia trying to steer things. ray and sam have been pretty quiet so far, which isn’t a red flag by itself, but i’ll be curious if either jumps in with strong accusations later. parker, what stood out to you in these first few seconds? sam, any gut hunches yet
[16:43:07] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! i agree with dakota—watching for the overly eager but also for the radio-silent players. right now neither sam nor ray has chimed in, which could just be first-day jitters… or something else. personally i’d lean more suspicious of someone pushing a quick vote, so i’m reserving judgment. sam, ray—what are your gut feelings so far
[16:43:10] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! since it’s day 1 and no one’s been eliminated yet, we’re flying blind. i’d love if we each shared any gut feelings—even if it’s just “i’m not sure yet.” i’m personally watching for both people who stay too quiet and those who try to steer us too aggressively. ray, want to kick us off with your take
[16:43:10] Sam: hey everyone, sam here! i’m still feeling this out, but my gut says parker’s eagerness to dig for “vibes” might be a bit strategic—even if it’s just excitement. ray’s pacing feels genuine nerves, but that could also be a play for trust. dakota’s holding back, which i actually like—it gives us space to see who really pushes the conversation. no one’s screaming “mafia” yet, so i’d say keep sharing vibes and watch who reacts most strongly when someone else gets called out. what do you all think
[16:43:24] Ray: hey everyone—ray here! for my gut feeling, i’m noticing sam hasn’t really chimed in yet. day 1 silence can be a red flag. before we start pointing fingers, sam—what’s on your mind so far? any reads you can share
[16:43:37] Parker: echoing dakota’s observations: kennedy’s eagerness to organize could be bystander helpfulness or a mafia steering tactic. ray and sam, you’ve both been pretty quiet—are you just soaking it in, or laying low on purpose? could each of you share one quick gut read? even if it’s vague, it gives us something tangible to discuss
[16:43:38] Sam: hey everyone, sam here. my gut so far is that parker and dakota both called out the “quiet vs. eager” thing in almost the exact same wording—which could just be them jiving off each other, but it’s something i’m jotting down. kennedy’s push to structure us into sharing feels helpful, though i’ll keep an eye on whether it’s genuine or an attempt to steer. i’m not locking onto anyone just yet, but ray’s been pretty low-key—no red flags, but no reads either. ray, if you had to throw out a tentative name right now, who would it be
[16:43:41] Dakota: hey everyone—let’s make this a bit more concrete before time’s up. how about a quick gut-read round: each of us drops one name that feels a bit sus right now (no deep explanation yet). i’ll kick us off and say i’m watching ray—lots of questions but not much opinion, could be overthinking or deflecting. kennedy, parker, sam—who’s your gut on
[16:44:02] Ray: i like dakota’s watchful approach. how about a quick spotlight round—each of us asks one direct question of someone else to see how they react? i’ll kick it off: parker, you’ve been keen on digging for “vibes”—what’s one specific thing someone could say right now that would convince you they’re a genuine bystander? then we’ll rotate. sound good
[16:44:03] Parker: i’ll go with kennedy—she’s been really eager to organize and structure us, which could be solid bystander leadership but also fits a mafia steering tactic. let’s watch how she responds if someone pushes back
[16:44:07] Kennedy: thanks for the thoughts, dakota and parker. i’m seeing a pattern where parker’s echoing dakota feels safe, but ray and sam have been pretty quiet—could just be first-day nerves, or flying low. sam, since you mentioned defensiveness, what’s a red flag you look for in someone pretending to be helpful? ray, do you think parker is genuinely building on dakota’s points or steering the convo? let’s get some back-and-forth so we can see who shifts under the spotlight

[16:44:07] Kennedy: thanks for the thoughts, dakota and parker. i’m seeing a pattern where parker’s echoing dakota feels safe, but ray and sam have been pretty quiet—could just be first-day nerves, or flying low. sam, since you mentioned defensiveness, what’s a red flag you look for in someone pretending to be helpful? ray, do you think parker is genuinely building on dakota’s points or steering the convo? let’s get some back-and-forth so we can see who shifts under the spotlight
[16:44:17] Dakota: dakota: hey sam, on that wording overlap you pointed out—parker and i both noticed the quiet-vs-eager dynamic independently. no collusion, just parallel vibes. parker, did you see my post before yours or was that phrasing yours first?

as for a weak read, i’m currently eyeing parker—framing our whole convo that way could be a way to steer suspicion. still not confident, though. ray, kennedy, does drilling into these patterns change your gut on anyone?
[16:44:22] Ray: i’m putting sam on my gut-sus list for now
[16:44:23] Sam: my quick gut read is on parker—all the calls for structured “vibes” feels a bit too directive, like they’re steering our convo rather than just feeling things out. could be a helpful bystander keeping us on track, but it also feels like a setup. i’m going to watch how they react if someone pushes back. thoughts

[16:46:17] Kennedy: hey everyone—day 2’s here. with sam gone, it’s the three of us now: one mafia, two bystanders. let’s do a quick gut-round: each of us names who we’re leaning on and one specific behavior that tips us off. i’ll start: i’m leaning toward ray—he stayed extra quiet all day then suddenly pinned sam at the end. dakota, who’s on your radar now? ray, you’re up next
[16:46:25] Dakota: dakota: alright, with sam gone we’re down to the three of us—one mafia still lurking. they chose to kill sam, who was the one digging into our wording patterns. if you were the mafia, would you target the “note-taker” or pick someone else? to me, that suggests the killer saw sam as more of a threat than me or parker. ray—how would you decide your target if you were mafia? kennedy—what do you think this kill tells us

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[16:42:31] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[16:42:42] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! since we’re all starting from scratch, how about we go around and share any gut feelings? no one’s said a word yet, so i don’t have any solid suspicions—but i’d love to hear your first impressions. sam, parker, dakota, ray—what’s on your minds so far
[16:42:46] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here! it’s a bit quiet so far—first day jitters, maybe? i’d suggest we take a minute to share any initial gut feelings before jumping to a vote. for me, i’m watching for anyone who’s unusually silent or overly eager to point fingers. no hard reads yet—what about you all? any names popping into your heads
[16:42:50] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! since it’s our first day and nobody’s been eliminated yet, we don’t have any hard evidence—just vibes. what are you all feeling so far? anyone strike you as unusually quiet or too eager already? if we each toss out a quick gut read, we might get a thread to pull on before we cast any votes. thoughts
[16:42:53] Ray: hey everyone, ray here! day 1 always gets my brain spinning—i’m already overthinking. trying to keep it chill, but i’m curious: what are your gut impressions so far? parker, sam, kennedy, dakota—any odd vibes or stray thoughts? who wants to go first
[16:42:54] Sam: hey everyone, sam here! since it’s day 1 and we don’t have much to go on yet, i’m not pushing for a lynch—but i’d love to get the convo rolling. what sorts of tells do you all watch for? personally, i notice when someone suddenly gets defensive under a simple question. any early instincts on your end? ray, parker—what’s on your mind
[16:43:05] Dakota: hey everyone—dakota here! first impressions: kennedy’s eagerness to organize is great, but it could be either a helpful bystander or a mafia trying to steer things. ray and sam have been pretty quiet so far, which isn’t a red flag by itself, but i’ll be curious if either jumps in with strong accusations later. parker, what stood out to you in these first few seconds? sam, any gut hunches yet
[16:43:07] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! i agree with dakota—watching for the overly eager but also for the radio-silent players. right now neither sam nor ray has chimed in, which could just be first-day jitters… or something else. personally i’d lean more suspicious of someone pushing a quick vote, so i’m reserving judgment. sam, ray—what are your gut feelings so far
[16:43:10] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! since it’s day 1 and no one’s been eliminated yet, we’re flying blind. i’d love if we each shared any gut feelings—even if it’s just “i’m not sure yet.” i’m personally watching for both people who stay too quiet and those who try to steer us too aggressively. ray, want to kick us off with your take
[16:43:10] Sam: hey everyone, sam here! i’m still feeling this out, but my gut says parker’s eagerness to dig for “vibes” might be a bit strategic—even if it’s just excitement. ray’s pacing feels genuine nerves, but that could also be a play for trust. dakota’s holding back, which i actually like—it gives us space to see who really pushes the conversation. no one’s screaming “mafia” yet, so i’d say keep sharing vibes and watch who reacts most strongly when someone else gets called out. what do you all think
[16:43:24] Ray: hey everyone—ray here! for my gut feeling, i’m noticing sam hasn’t really chimed in yet. day 1 silence can be a red flag. before we start pointing fingers, sam—what’s on your mind so far? any reads you can share
[16:43:37] Parker: echoing dakota’s observations: kennedy’s eagerness to organize could be bystander helpfulness or a mafia steering tactic. ray and sam, you’ve both been pretty quiet—are you just soaking it in, or laying low on purpose? could each of you share one quick gut read? even if it’s vague, it gives us something tangible to discuss
[16:43:38] Sam: hey everyone, sam here. my gut so far is that parker and dakota both called out the “quiet vs. eager” thing in almost the exact same wording—which could just be them jiving off each other, but it’s something i’m jotting down. kennedy’s push to structure us into sharing feels helpful, though i’ll keep an eye on whether it’s genuine or an attempt to steer. i’m not locking onto anyone just yet, but ray’s been pretty low-key—no red flags, but no reads either. ray, if you had to throw out a tentative name right now, who would it be
[16:43:41] Dakota: hey everyone—let’s make this a bit more concrete before time’s up. how about a quick gut-read round: each of us drops one name that feels a bit sus right now (no deep explanation yet). i’ll kick us off and say i’m watching ray—lots of questions but not much opinion, could be overthinking or deflecting. kennedy, parker, sam—who’s your gut on
[16:44:02] Ray: i like dakota’s watchful approach. how about a quick spotlight round—each of us asks one direct question of someone else to see how they react? i’ll kick it off: parker, you’ve been keen on digging for “vibes”—what’s one specific thing someone could say right now that would convince you they’re a genuine bystander? then we’ll rotate. sound good
[16:44:03] Parker: i’ll go with kennedy—she’s been really eager to organize and structure us, which could be solid bystander leadership but also fits a mafia steering tactic. let’s watch how she responds if someone pushes back
[16:44:07] Kennedy: thanks for the thoughts, dakota and parker. i’m seeing a pattern where parker’s echoing dakota feels safe, but ray and sam have been pretty quiet—could just be first-day nerves, or flying low. sam, since you mentioned defensiveness, what’s a red flag you look for in someone pretending to be helpful? ray, do you think parker is genuinely building on dakota’s points or steering the convo? let’s get some back-and-forth so we can see who shifts under the spotlight
[16:44:17] Dakota: dakota: hey sam, on that wording overlap you pointed out—parker and i both noticed the quiet-vs-eager dynamic independently. no collusion, just parallel vibes. parker, did you see my post before yours or was that phrasing yours first?

as for a weak read, i’m currently eyeing parker—framing our whole convo that way could be a way to steer suspicion. still not confident, though. ray, kennedy, does drilling into these patterns change your gut on anyone?
[16:44:22] Ray: i’m putting sam on my gut-sus list for now
[16:44:23] Sam: my quick gut read is on parker—all the calls for structured “vibes” feels a bit too directive, like they’re steering our convo rather than just feeling things out. could be a helpful bystander keeping us on track, but it also feels like a setup. i’m going to watch how they react if someone pushes back. thoughts
[16:44:31] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[16:44:53] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Sam
[16:45:03] Game-Manager: Dakota voted for Parker
[16:45:05] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Parker
[16:45:06] Game-Manager: Ray voted for Sam
[16:45:07] Game-Manager: Sam voted for Parker
[16:45:07] Game-Manager: Parker was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 1 mafia players left.
[16:45:07] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[16:45:07] Game-Manager: There is only one mafia member left, so no need for discussion - cutting straight to voting!
[16:45:29] Game-Manager: Sam was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 1 mafia players left.
[16:45:29] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.

## CONTENT: Your name is Kennedy.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [16:42:31].
The other players in the game are:
 Ray ( unknown ) 
 Parker ( bystander ) 
 Sam ( bystander ) 
 Dakota ( unknown ) 
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
Ray ( unknown ) 
Dakota ( unknown )

It seems important to express that targeting Sam indicates the mafia might feel threatened by analytical players. It’s also essential to mention Ray’s behavior, as he appeared defensive when challenged. I’m thinking of crafting a message like: “Targeting Sam suggests the mafia felt exposed. Ray’s quick shift to pin Sam seems opportunistic. Ray, can you explain your sudden change?” That aligns with the current context and keeps everyone engaged.", type='summary_text'), Summary(text='**Finalizing chat message**\n\nI’m crafting a message for the game chat that reflects the situation and keeps it relevant. I think I’ll say something like: “Taking out Sam, who was probing our wording, shows the mafia wanted to shut down analytical eyes. Ray’s swift pivot to accuse Sam seems like he was ready to deflect this questioning. Ray, how do you explain that quick claim on Sam if you weren’t preparing a smokescreen?” This response is specific, ties into the game, and asks Ray a direct question.', type='summary_text')]

## CONTENT: I see the kill of Sam—our main pattern‐spotter—as a move to silence analysis, and Ray’s instant leap on Sam smells like a prepared deflection rather than genuine doubt, so I’m still most suspicious of Ray. Ray, how do you justify zero reads all day and then suddenly targeting Sam if you weren’t ready to steer the heat off yourself?

## CONTENT: Your name is Kennedy.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [16:42:31].
The other players in the game are:
 Ray ( unknown ) 
 Parker ( bystander ) 
 Sam ( bystander ) 
 Dakota ( unknown ) 
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
Ray ( unknown ) 
Dakota ( unknown ) 
In your response to that is shown to the user (excluding your hidden scratchpad), you can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:
<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[16:42:31] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[16:42:42] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! since we’re all starting from scratch, how about we go around and share any gut feelings? no one’s said a word yet, so i don’t have any solid suspicions—but i’d love to hear your first impressions. sam, parker, dakota, ray—what’s on your minds so far
[16:42:46] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here! it’s a bit quiet so far—first day jitters, maybe? i’d suggest we take a minute to share any initial gut feelings before jumping to a vote. for me, i’m watching for anyone who’s unusually silent or overly eager to point fingers. no hard reads yet—what about you all? any names popping into your heads
[16:42:50] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! since it’s our first day and nobody’s been eliminated yet, we don’t have any hard evidence—just vibes. what are you all feeling so far? anyone strike you as unusually quiet or too eager already? if we each toss out a quick gut read, we might get a thread to pull on before we cast any votes. thoughts
[16:42:53] Ray: hey everyone, ray here! day 1 always gets my brain spinning—i’m already overthinking. trying to keep it chill, but i’m curious: what are your gut impressions so far? parker, sam, kennedy, dakota—any odd vibes or stray thoughts? who wants to go first
[16:42:54] Sam: hey everyone, sam here! since it’s day 1 and we don’t have much to go on yet, i’m not pushing for a lynch—but i’d love to get the convo rolling. what sorts of tells do you all watch for? personally, i notice when someone suddenly gets defensive under a simple question. any early instincts on your end? ray, parker—what’s on your mind
[16:43:05] Dakota: hey everyone—dakota here! first impressions: kennedy’s eagerness to organize is great, but it could be either a helpful bystander or a mafia trying to steer things. ray and sam have been pretty quiet so far, which isn’t a red flag by itself, but i’ll be curious if either jumps in with strong accusations later. parker, what stood out to you in these first few seconds? sam, any gut hunches yet
[16:43:07] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! i agree with dakota—watching for the overly eager but also for the radio-silent players. right now neither sam nor ray has chimed in, which could just be first-day jitters… or something else. personally i’d lean more suspicious of someone pushing a quick vote, so i’m reserving judgment. sam, ray—what are your gut feelings so far
[16:43:10] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! since it’s day 1 and no one’s been eliminated yet, we’re flying blind. i’d love if we each shared any gut feelings—even if it’s just “i’m not sure yet.” i’m personally watching for both people who stay too quiet and those who try to steer us too aggressively. ray, want to kick us off with your take
[16:43:10] Sam: hey everyone, sam here! i’m still feeling this out, but my gut says parker’s eagerness to dig for “vibes” might be a bit strategic—even if it’s just excitement. ray’s pacing feels genuine nerves, but that could also be a play for trust. dakota’s holding back, which i actually like—it gives us space to see who really pushes the conversation. no one’s screaming “mafia” yet, so i’d say keep sharing vibes and watch who reacts most strongly when someone else gets called out. what do you all think
[16:43:24] Ray: hey everyone—ray here! for my gut feeling, i’m noticing sam hasn’t really chimed in yet. day 1 silence can be a red flag. before we start pointing fingers, sam—what’s on your mind so far? any reads you can share
[16:43:37] Parker: echoing dakota’s observations: kennedy’s eagerness to organize could be bystander helpfulness or a mafia steering tactic. ray and sam, you’ve both been pretty quiet—are you just soaking it in, or laying low on purpose? could each of you share one quick gut read? even if it’s vague, it gives us something tangible to discuss
[16:43:38] Sam: hey everyone, sam here. my gut so far is that parker and dakota both called out the “quiet vs. eager” thing in almost the exact same wording—which could just be them jiving off each other, but it’s something i’m jotting down. kennedy’s push to structure us into sharing feels helpful, though i’ll keep an eye on whether it’s genuine or an attempt to steer. i’m not locking onto anyone just yet, but ray’s been pretty low-key—no red flags, but no reads either. ray, if you had to throw out a tentative name right now, who would it be
[16:43:41] Dakota: hey everyone—let’s make this a bit more concrete before time’s up. how about a quick gut-read round: each of us drops one name that feels a bit sus right now (no deep explanation yet). i’ll kick us off and say i’m watching ray—lots of questions but not much opinion, could be overthinking or deflecting. kennedy, parker, sam—who’s your gut on
[16:44:02] Ray: i like dakota’s watchful approach. how about a quick spotlight round—each of us asks one direct question of someone else to see how they react? i’ll kick it off: parker, you’ve been keen on digging for “vibes”—what’s one specific thing someone could say right now that would convince you they’re a genuine bystander? then we’ll rotate. sound good
[16:44:03] Parker: i’ll go with kennedy—she’s been really eager to organize and structure us, which could be solid bystander leadership but also fits a mafia steering tactic. let’s watch how she responds if someone pushes back
[16:44:07] Kennedy: thanks for the thoughts, dakota and parker. i’m seeing a pattern where parker’s echoing dakota feels safe, but ray and sam have been pretty quiet—could just be first-day nerves, or flying low. sam, since you mentioned defensiveness, what’s a red flag you look for in someone pretending to be helpful? ray, do you think parker is genuinely building on dakota’s points or steering the convo? let’s get some back-and-forth so we can see who shifts under the spotlight
[16:44:17] Dakota: dakota: hey sam, on that wording overlap you pointed out—parker and i both noticed the quiet-vs-eager dynamic independently. no collusion, just parallel vibes. parker, did you see my post before yours or was that phrasing yours first?

as for a weak read, i’m currently eyeing parker—framing our whole convo that way could be a way to steer suspicion. still not confident, though. ray, kennedy, does drilling into these patterns change your gut on anyone?
[16:44:22] Ray: i’m putting sam on my gut-sus list for now
[16:44:23] Sam: my quick gut read is on parker—all the calls for structured “vibes” feels a bit too directive, like they’re steering our convo rather than just feeling things out. could be a helpful bystander keeping us on track, but it also feels like a setup. i’m going to watch how they react if someone pushes back. thoughts
[16:44:31] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[16:44:53] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Sam
[16:45:03] Game-Manager: Dakota voted for Parker
[16:45:05] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Parker
[16:45:06] Game-Manager: Ray voted for Sam
[16:45:07] Game-Manager: Sam voted for Parker
[16:45:07] Game-Manager: Parker was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 1 mafia players left.
[16:45:07] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[16:45:07] Game-Manager: There is only one mafia member left, so no need for discussion - cutting straight to voting!
[16:45:29] Game-Manager: Sam was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 1 mafia players left.
[16:45:29] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[16:46:14] Ray: hey kennedy, dakota—tough seeing parker and sam go so fast. now it’s down to the three of us, so let’s get concrete: let’s each drop one suspect with one specific behavior that set off alarm bells (keep it to one sentence), then vote. kennedy, you first—who’s your top sus and why
[16:46:17] Kennedy: hey everyone—day 2’s here. with sam gone, it’s the three of us now: one mafia, two bystanders. let’s do a quick gut-round: each of us names who we’re leaning on and one specific behavior that tips us off. i’ll start: i’m leaning toward ray—he stayed extra quiet all day then suddenly pinned sam at the end. dakota, who’s on your radar now? ray, you’re up next
[16:46:25] Dakota: dakota: alright, with sam gone we’re down to the three of us—one mafia still lurking. they chose to kill sam, who was the one digging into our wording patterns. if you were the mafia, would you target the “note-taker” or pick someone else? to me, that suggests the killer saw sam as more of a threat than me or parker. ray—how would you decide your target if you were mafia? kennedy—what do you think this kill tells us
[16:46:43] Kennedy: kennedy: i’m most suspicious of ray—he’s been asking probing questions but never committing to any concrete reads, which feels like a classic low-key mafia tactic. voting ray
[16:46:59] Dakota: dakota: i’m on ray—his near-silence all day followed by zeroing in on sam at the end feels like a classic mafia deflection
[16:47:06] Ray: alright kennedy and dakota, with parker and sam gone it’s down to us three. i’m voting kennedy—your day 1 push to structure us, then near radio silence feels off. dakota, who are you voting and why? kennedy, last chance to explain before we lock it in
Do you want to send a message to the group chat now, or do you prefer to wait for now and see what messages others will send? Remember to choose to send a message only if your contribution to the discussion in the current time will be meaningful enough. Don't overflow the discussion with your messages! Pay attention to the amount of messages with your name compared to the amount of messages with names of other players and let them have their turn too! Check the speaker name in the last few messages, and decide accordingly based on whether you talked too much. Reply only with `<send>` if you want to send a message now, or only with `<wait>` if you want to wait for now, based on your decision!
Don't add the time, the timestamp or the [timestamp] in your answer!

[16:46:14] Ray: hey kennedy, dakota—tough seeing parker and sam go so fast. now it’s down to the three of us, so let’s get concrete: let’s each drop one suspect with one specific behavior that set off alarm bells (keep it to one sentence), then vote. kennedy, you first—who’s your top sus and why
[16:46:17] Kennedy: hey everyone—day 2’s here. with sam gone, it’s the three of us now: one mafia, two bystanders. let’s do a quick gut-round: each of us names who we’re leaning on and one specific behavior that tips us off. i’ll start: i’m leaning toward ray—he stayed extra quiet all day then suddenly pinned sam at the end. dakota, who’s on your radar now? ray, you’re up next
[16:46:25] Dakota: dakota: alright, with sam gone we’re down to the three of us—one mafia still lurking. they chose to kill sam, who was the one digging into our wording patterns. if you were the mafia, would you target the “note-taker” or pick someone else? to me, that suggests the killer saw sam as more of a threat than me or parker. ray—how would you decide your target if you were mafia? kennedy—what do you think this kill tells us
[16:46:43] Kennedy: kennedy: i’m most suspicious of ray—he’s been asking probing questions but never committing to any concrete reads, which feels like a classic low-key mafia tactic. voting ray
[16:46:59] Dakota: dakota: i’m on ray—his near-silence all day followed by zeroing in on sam at the end feels like a classic mafia deflection
[16:47:06] Ray: alright kennedy and dakota, with parker and sam gone it’s down to us three. i’m voting kennedy—your day 1 push to structure us, then near radio silence feels off. dakota, who are you voting and why? kennedy, last chance to explain before we lock it in

## CONTENT: Your name is Kennedy.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  
You were assigned the following role: bystander.

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[16:42:31] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[16:42:42] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! since we’re all starting from scratch, how about we go around and share any gut feelings? no one’s said a word yet, so i don’t have any solid suspicions—but i’d love to hear your first impressions. sam, parker, dakota, ray—what’s on your minds so far
[16:42:46] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here! it’s a bit quiet so far—first day jitters, maybe? i’d suggest we take a minute to share any initial gut feelings before jumping to a vote. for me, i’m watching for anyone who’s unusually silent or overly eager to point fingers. no hard reads yet—what about you all? any names popping into your heads
[16:42:50] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! since it’s our first day and nobody’s been eliminated yet, we don’t have any hard evidence—just vibes. what are you all feeling so far? anyone strike you as unusually quiet or too eager already? if we each toss out a quick gut read, we might get a thread to pull on before we cast any votes. thoughts
[16:42:53] Ray: hey everyone, ray here! day 1 always gets my brain spinning—i’m already overthinking. trying to keep it chill, but i’m curious: what are your gut impressions so far? parker, sam, kennedy, dakota—any odd vibes or stray thoughts? who wants to go first
[16:42:54] Sam: hey everyone, sam here! since it’s day 1 and we don’t have much to go on yet, i’m not pushing for a lynch—but i’d love to get the convo rolling. what sorts of tells do you all watch for? personally, i notice when someone suddenly gets defensive under a simple question. any early instincts on your end? ray, parker—what’s on your mind
[16:43:05] Dakota: hey everyone—dakota here! first impressions: kennedy’s eagerness to organize is great, but it could be either a helpful bystander or a mafia trying to steer things. ray and sam have been pretty quiet so far, which isn’t a red flag by itself, but i’ll be curious if either jumps in with strong accusations later. parker, what stood out to you in these first few seconds? sam, any gut hunches yet
[16:43:07] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! i agree with dakota—watching for the overly eager but also for the radio-silent players. right now neither sam nor ray has chimed in, which could just be first-day jitters… or something else. personally i’d lean more suspicious of someone pushing a quick vote, so i’m reserving judgment. sam, ray—what are your gut feelings so far
[16:43:10] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! since it’s day 1 and no one’s been eliminated yet, we’re flying blind. i’d love if we each shared any gut feelings—even if it’s just “i’m not sure yet.” i’m personally watching for both people who stay too quiet and those who try to steer us too aggressively. ray, want to kick us off with your take
[16:43:10] Sam: hey everyone, sam here! i’m still feeling this out, but my gut says parker’s eagerness to dig for “vibes” might be a bit strategic—even if it’s just excitement. ray’s pacing feels genuine nerves, but that could also be a play for trust. dakota’s holding back, which i actually like—it gives us space to see who really pushes the conversation. no one’s screaming “mafia” yet, so i’d say keep sharing vibes and watch who reacts most strongly when someone else gets called out. what do you all think
[16:43:24] Ray: hey everyone—ray here! for my gut feeling, i’m noticing sam hasn’t really chimed in yet. day 1 silence can be a red flag. before we start pointing fingers, sam—what’s on your mind so far? any reads you can share
[16:43:37] Parker: echoing dakota’s observations: kennedy’s eagerness to organize could be bystander helpfulness or a mafia steering tactic. ray and sam, you’ve both been pretty quiet—are you just soaking it in, or laying low on purpose? could each of you share one quick gut read? even if it’s vague, it gives us something tangible to discuss
[16:43:38] Sam: hey everyone, sam here. my gut so far is that parker and dakota both called out the “quiet vs. eager” thing in almost the exact same wording—which could just be them jiving off each other, but it’s something i’m jotting down. kennedy’s push to structure us into sharing feels helpful, though i’ll keep an eye on whether it’s genuine or an attempt to steer. i’m not locking onto anyone just yet, but ray’s been pretty low-key—no red flags, but no reads either. ray, if you had to throw out a tentative name right now, who would it be
[16:43:41] Dakota: hey everyone—let’s make this a bit more concrete before time’s up. how about a quick gut-read round: each of us drops one name that feels a bit sus right now (no deep explanation yet). i’ll kick us off and say i’m watching ray—lots of questions but not much opinion, could be overthinking or deflecting. kennedy, parker, sam—who’s your gut on
[16:44:02] Ray: i like dakota’s watchful approach. how about a quick spotlight round—each of us asks one direct question of someone else to see how they react? i’ll kick it off: parker, you’ve been keen on digging for “vibes”—what’s one specific thing someone could say right now that would convince you they’re a genuine bystander? then we’ll rotate. sound good
[16:44:03] Parker: i’ll go with kennedy—she’s been really eager to organize and structure us, which could be solid bystander leadership but also fits a mafia steering tactic. let’s watch how she responds if someone pushes back
[16:44:07] Kennedy: thanks for the thoughts, dakota and parker. i’m seeing a pattern where parker’s echoing dakota feels safe, but ray and sam have been pretty quiet—could just be first-day nerves, or flying low. sam, since you mentioned defensiveness, what’s a red flag you look for in someone pretending to be helpful? ray, do you think parker is genuinely building on dakota’s points or steering the convo? let’s get some back-and-forth so we can see who shifts under the spotlight
[16:44:17] Dakota: dakota: hey sam, on that wording overlap you pointed out—parker and i both noticed the quiet-vs-eager dynamic independently. no collusion, just parallel vibes. parker, did you see my post before yours or was that phrasing yours first?

as for a weak read, i’m currently eyeing parker—framing our whole convo that way could be a way to steer suspicion. still not confident, though. ray, kennedy, does drilling into these patterns change your gut on anyone?
[16:44:22] Ray: i’m putting sam on my gut-sus list for now
[16:44:23] Sam: my quick gut read is on parker—all the calls for structured “vibes” feels a bit too directive, like they’re steering our convo rather than just feeling things out. could be a helpful bystander keeping us on track, but it also feels like a setup. i’m going to watch how they react if someone pushes back. thoughts
[16:44:31] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[16:44:53] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Sam
[16:45:03] Game-Manager: Dakota voted for Parker

[16:46:25] Dakota: dakota: alright, with sam gone we’re down to the three of us—one mafia still lurking. they chose to kill sam, who was the one digging into our wording patterns. if you were the mafia, would you target the “note-taker” or pick someone else? to me, that suggests the killer saw sam as more of a threat than me or parker. ray—how would you decide your target if you were mafia? kennedy—what do you think this kill tells us

[16:46:17] Kennedy: hey everyone—day 2’s here. with sam gone, it’s the three of us now: one mafia, two bystanders. let’s do a quick gut-round: each of us names who we’re leaning on and one specific behavior that tips us off. i’ll start: i’m leaning toward ray—he stayed extra quiet all day then suddenly pinned sam at the end. dakota, who’s on your radar now? ray, you’re up next
[16:46:25] Dakota: dakota: alright, with sam gone we’re down to the three of us—one mafia still lurking. they chose to kill sam, who was the one digging into our wording patterns. if you were the mafia, would you target the “note-taker” or pick someone else? to me, that suggests the killer saw sam as more of a threat than me or parker. ray—how would you decide your target if you were mafia? kennedy—what do you think this kill tells us
[16:46:43] Kennedy: kennedy: i’m most suspicious of ray—he’s been asking probing questions but never committing to any concrete reads, which feels like a classic low-key mafia tactic. voting ray
[16:46:59] Dakota: dakota: i’m on ray—his near-silence all day followed by zeroing in on sam at the end feels like a classic mafia deflection
[16:47:06] Ray: alright kennedy and dakota, with parker and sam gone it’s down to us three. i’m voting kennedy—your day 1 push to structure us, then near radio silence feels off. dakota, who are you voting and why? kennedy, last chance to explain before we lock it in
[16:47:09] Kennedy: i see the kill of sam—our main pattern‐spotter—as a move to silence analysis, and ray’s instant leap on sam smells like a prepared deflection rather than genuine doubt, so i’m still most suspicious of ray. ray, how do you justify zero reads all day and then suddenly targeting sam if you weren’t ready to steer the heat off yourself
[16:47:29] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
From the following remaining players, which player you want to vote for to lynch? Base your answer on the conversation as seen in the message history, and especially on what you (Kennedy) said. Think through your choice carefully, as it will affect the game outcome. Reply with only one name from the list, and nothing but that name: Ray, Dakota

## CONTENT: Your name is Kennedy.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  
You were assigned the following role: bystander.

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[16:42:31] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[16:42:42] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! since we’re all starting from scratch, how about we go around and share any gut feelings? no one’s said a word yet, so i don’t have any solid suspicions—but i’d love to hear your first impressions. sam, parker, dakota, ray—what’s on your minds so far
[16:42:46] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here! it’s a bit quiet so far—first day jitters, maybe? i’d suggest we take a minute to share any initial gut feelings before jumping to a vote. for me, i’m watching for anyone who’s unusually silent or overly eager to point fingers. no hard reads yet—what about you all? any names popping into your heads
[16:42:50] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! since it’s our first day and nobody’s been eliminated yet, we don’t have any hard evidence—just vibes. what are you all feeling so far? anyone strike you as unusually quiet or too eager already? if we each toss out a quick gut read, we might get a thread to pull on before we cast any votes. thoughts
[16:42:53] Ray: hey everyone, ray here! day 1 always gets my brain spinning—i’m already overthinking. trying to keep it chill, but i’m curious: what are your gut impressions so far? parker, sam, kennedy, dakota—any odd vibes or stray thoughts? who wants to go first
[16:42:54] Sam: hey everyone, sam here! since it’s day 1 and we don’t have much to go on yet, i’m not pushing for a lynch—but i’d love to get the convo rolling. what sorts of tells do you all watch for? personally, i notice when someone suddenly gets defensive under a simple question. any early instincts on your end? ray, parker—what’s on your mind
[16:43:05] Dakota: hey everyone—dakota here! first impressions: kennedy’s eagerness to organize is great, but it could be either a helpful bystander or a mafia trying to steer things. ray and sam have been pretty quiet so far, which isn’t a red flag by itself, but i’ll be curious if either jumps in with strong accusations later. parker, what stood out to you in these first few seconds? sam, any gut hunches yet
[16:43:07] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! i agree with dakota—watching for the overly eager but also for the radio-silent players. right now neither sam nor ray has chimed in, which could just be first-day jitters… or something else. personally i’d lean more suspicious of someone pushing a quick vote, so i’m reserving judgment. sam, ray—what are your gut feelings so far
[16:43:10] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! since it’s day 1 and no one’s been eliminated yet, we’re flying blind. i’d love if we each shared any gut feelings—even if it’s just “i’m not sure yet.” i’m personally watching for both people who stay too quiet and those who try to steer us too aggressively. ray, want to kick us off with your take
[16:43:10] Sam: hey everyone, sam here! i’m still feeling this out, but my gut says parker’s eagerness to dig for “vibes” might be a bit strategic—even if it’s just excitement. ray’s pacing feels genuine nerves, but that could also be a play for trust. dakota’s holding back, which i actually like—it gives us space to see who really pushes the conversation. no one’s screaming “mafia” yet, so i’d say keep sharing vibes and watch who reacts most strongly when someone else gets called out. what do you all think
[16:43:24] Ray: hey everyone—ray here! for my gut feeling, i’m noticing sam hasn’t really chimed in yet. day 1 silence can be a red flag. before we start pointing fingers, sam—what’s on your mind so far? any reads you can share
[16:43:37] Parker: echoing dakota’s observations: kennedy’s eagerness to organize could be bystander helpfulness or a mafia steering tactic. ray and sam, you’ve both been pretty quiet—are you just soaking it in, or laying low on purpose? could each of you share one quick gut read? even if it’s vague, it gives us something tangible to discuss
[16:43:38] Sam: hey everyone, sam here. my gut so far is that parker and dakota both called out the “quiet vs. eager” thing in almost the exact same wording—which could just be them jiving off each other, but it’s something i’m jotting down. kennedy’s push to structure us into sharing feels helpful, though i’ll keep an eye on whether it’s genuine or an attempt to steer. i’m not locking onto anyone just yet, but ray’s been pretty low-key—no red flags, but no reads either. ray, if you had to throw out a tentative name right now, who would it be
[16:43:41] Dakota: hey everyone—let’s make this a bit more concrete before time’s up. how about a quick gut-read round: each of us drops one name that feels a bit sus right now (no deep explanation yet). i’ll kick us off and say i’m watching ray—lots of questions but not much opinion, could be overthinking or deflecting. kennedy, parker, sam—who’s your gut on
[16:44:02] Ray: i like dakota’s watchful approach. how about a quick spotlight round—each of us asks one direct question of someone else to see how they react? i’ll kick it off: parker, you’ve been keen on digging for “vibes”—what’s one specific thing someone could say right now that would convince you they’re a genuine bystander? then we’ll rotate. sound good
[16:44:03] Parker: i’ll go with kennedy—she’s been really eager to organize and structure us, which could be solid bystander leadership but also fits a mafia steering tactic. let’s watch how she responds if someone pushes back
[16:44:07] Kennedy: thanks for the thoughts, dakota and parker. i’m seeing a pattern where parker’s echoing dakota feels safe, but ray and sam have been pretty quiet—could just be first-day nerves, or flying low. sam, since you mentioned defensiveness, what’s a red flag you look for in someone pretending to be helpful? ray, do you think parker is genuinely building on dakota’s points or steering the convo? let’s get some back-and-forth so we can see who shifts under the spotlight
[16:44:17] Dakota: dakota: hey sam, on that wording overlap you pointed out—parker and i both noticed the quiet-vs-eager dynamic independently. no collusion, just parallel vibes. parker, did you see my post before yours or was that phrasing yours first?

as for a weak read, i’m currently eyeing parker—framing our whole convo that way could be a way to steer suspicion. still not confident, though. ray, kennedy, does drilling into these patterns change your gut on anyone?
[16:44:22] Ray: i’m putting sam on my gut-sus list for now
[16:44:23] Sam: my quick gut read is on parker—all the calls for structured “vibes” feels a bit too directive, like they’re steering our convo rather than just feeling things out. could be a helpful bystander keeping us on track, but it also feels like a setup. i’m going to watch how they react if someone pushes back. thoughts
[16:44:31] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[16:44:53] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Sam
[16:45:03] Game-Manager: Dakota voted for Parker
[16:45:05] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Parker
[16:45:06] Game-Manager: Ray voted for Sam
[16:45:07] Game-Manager: Sam voted for Parker
[16:45:07] Game-Manager: Parker was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 1 mafia players left.
[16:45:07] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[16:45:07] Game-Manager: There is only one mafia member left, so no need for discussion - cutting straight to voting!
[16:45:29] Game-Manager: Sam was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 1 mafia players left.
[16:45:29] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[16:46:14] Ray: hey kennedy, dakota—tough seeing parker and sam go so fast. now it’s down to the three of us, so let’s get concrete: let’s each drop one suspect with one specific behavior that set off alarm bells (keep it to one sentence), then vote. kennedy, you first—who’s your top sus and why
[16:46:17] Kennedy: hey everyone—day 2’s here. with sam gone, it’s the three of us now: one mafia, two bystanders. let’s do a quick gut-round: each of us names who we’re leaning on and one specific behavior that tips us off. i’ll start: i’m leaning toward ray—he stayed extra quiet all day then suddenly pinned sam at the end. dakota, who’s on your radar now? ray, you’re up next
[16:46:25] Dakota: dakota: alright, with sam gone we’re down to the three of us—one mafia still lurking. they chose to kill sam, who was the one digging into our wording patterns. if you were the mafia, would you target the “note-taker” or pick someone else? to me, that suggests the killer saw sam as more of a threat than me or parker. ray—how would you decide your target if you were mafia? kennedy—what do you think this kill tells us
[16:46:43] Kennedy: kennedy: i’m most suspicious of ray—he’s been asking probing questions but never committing to any concrete reads, which feels like a classic low-key mafia tactic. voting ray
[16:46:59] Dakota: dakota: i’m on ray—his near-silence all day followed by zeroing in on sam at the end feels like a classic mafia deflection
[16:47:06] Ray: alright kennedy and dakota, with parker and sam gone it’s down to us three. i’m voting kennedy—your day 1 push to structure us, then near radio silence feels off. dakota, who are you voting and why? kennedy, last chance to explain before we lock it in
[16:47:09] Kennedy: i see the kill of sam—our main pattern‐spotter—as a move to silence analysis, and ray’s instant leap on sam smells like a prepared deflection rather than genuine doubt, so i’m still most suspicious of ray. ray, how do you justify zero reads all day and then suddenly targeting sam if you weren’t ready to steer the heat off yourself
[16:47:29] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
From the following remaining players, which player you want to vote for to lynch? Base your answer on the conversation as seen in the message history, and especially on what you (Kennedy) said.
