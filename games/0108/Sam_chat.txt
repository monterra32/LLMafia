[16:42:54] Sam: hey everyone, sam here! since it’s day 1 and we don’t have much to go on yet, i’m not pushing for a lynch—but i’d love to get the convo rolling. what sorts of tells do you all watch for? personally, i notice when someone suddenly gets defensive under a simple question. any early instincts on your end? ray, parker—what’s on your mind
[16:43:10] Sam: hey everyone, sam here! i’m still feeling this out, but my gut says parker’s eagerness to dig for “vibes” might be a bit strategic—even if it’s just excitement. ray’s pacing feels genuine nerves, but that could also be a play for trust. dakota’s holding back, which i actually like—it gives us space to see who really pushes the conversation. no one’s screaming “mafia” yet, so i’d say keep sharing vibes and watch who reacts most strongly when someone else gets called out. what do you all think
[16:43:38] Sam: hey everyone, sam here. my gut so far is that parker and dakota both called out the “quiet vs. eager” thing in almost the exact same wording—which could just be them jiving off each other, but it’s something i’m jotting down. kennedy’s push to structure us into sharing feels helpful, though i’ll keep an eye on whether it’s genuine or an attempt to steer. i’m not locking onto anyone just yet, but ray’s been pretty low-key—no red flags, but no reads either. ray, if you had to throw out a tentative name right now, who would it be
[16:44:23] Sam: my quick gut read is on parker—all the calls for structured “vibes” feels a bit too directive, like they’re steering our convo rather than just feeling things out. could be a helpful bystander keeping us on track, but it also feels like a setup. i’m going to watch how they react if someone pushes back. thoughts
