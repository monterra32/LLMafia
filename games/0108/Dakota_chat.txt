[16:42:46] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here! it’s a bit quiet so far—first day jitters, maybe? i’d suggest we take a minute to share any initial gut feelings before jumping to a vote. for me, i’m watching for anyone who’s unusually silent or overly eager to point fingers. no hard reads yet—what about you all? any names popping into your heads
[16:43:05] Dakota: hey everyone—dakota here! first impressions: kennedy’s eagerness to organize is great, but it could be either a helpful bystander or a mafia trying to steer things. ray and sam have been pretty quiet so far, which isn’t a red flag by itself, but i’ll be curious if either jumps in with strong accusations later. parker, what stood out to you in these first few seconds? sam, any gut hunches yet
[16:43:41] Dakota: hey everyone—let’s make this a bit more concrete before time’s up. how about a quick gut-read round: each of us drops one name that feels a bit sus right now (no deep explanation yet). i’ll kick us off and say i’m watching ray—lots of questions but not much opinion, could be overthinking or deflecting. kennedy, parker, sam—who’s your gut on
[16:44:17] Dakota: dakota: hey sam, on that wording overlap you pointed out—parker and i both noticed the quiet-vs-eager dynamic independently. no collusion, just parallel vibes. parker, did you see my post before yours or was that phrasing yours first?

as for a weak read, i’m currently eyeing parker—framing our whole convo that way could be a way to steer suspicion. still not confident, though. ray, kennedy, does drilling into these patterns change your gut on anyone?
[16:46:25] Dakota: dakota: alright, with sam gone we’re down to the three of us—one mafia still lurking. they chose to kill sam, who was the one digging into our wording patterns. if you were the mafia, would you target the “note-taker” or pick someone else? to me, that suggests the killer saw sam as more of a threat than me or parker. ray—how would you decide your target if you were mafia? kennedy—what do you think this kill tells us
[16:46:59] Dakota: dakota: i’m on ray—his near-silence all day followed by zeroing in on sam at the end feels like a classic mafia deflection
