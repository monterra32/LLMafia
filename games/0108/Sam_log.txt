## CONTENT: You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  + 
 + Do you understand the rules? +

[16:42:50] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! since it’s our first day and nobody’s been eliminated yet, we don’t have any hard evidence—just vibes. what are you all feeling so far? anyone strike you as unusually quiet or too eager already? if we each toss out a quick gut read, we might get a thread to pull on before we cast any votes. thoughts
[16:42:53] Ray: hey everyone, ray here! day 1 always gets my brain spinning—i’m already overthinking. trying to keep it chill, but i’m curious: what are your gut impressions so far? parker, sam, kennedy, dakota—any odd vibes or stray thoughts? who wants to go first

[16:42:42] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! since we’re all starting from scratch, how about we go around and share any gut feelings? no one’s said a word yet, so i don’t have any solid suspicions—but i’d love to hear your first impressions. sam, parker, dakota, ray—what’s on your minds so far
[16:42:46] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here! it’s a bit quiet so far—first day jitters, maybe? i’d suggest we take a minute to share any initial gut feelings before jumping to a vote. for me, i’m watching for anyone who’s unusually silent or overly eager to point fingers. no hard reads yet—what about you all? any names popping into your heads
[16:42:50] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! since it’s our first day and nobody’s been eliminated yet, we don’t have any hard evidence—just vibes. what are you all feeling so far? anyone strike you as unusually quiet or too eager already? if we each toss out a quick gut read, we might get a thread to pull on before we cast any votes. thoughts
[16:42:53] Ray: hey everyone, ray here! day 1 always gets my brain spinning—i’m already overthinking. trying to keep it chill, but i’m curious: what are your gut impressions so far? parker, sam, kennedy, dakota—any odd vibes or stray thoughts? who wants to go first

## CONTENT: Your name is Sam.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [16:42:31].
The other players in the game are:
 Ray ( unknown ) 
 Parker ( unknown ) 
 Kennedy ( unknown ) 
 Dakota ( unknown ) 
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:

<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[16:42:42] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! since we’re all starting from scratch, how about we go around and share any gut feelings? no one’s said a word yet, so i don’t have any solid suspicions—but i’d love to hear your first impressions. sam, parker, dakota, ray—what’s on your minds so far
[16:42:46] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here! it’s a bit quiet so far—first day jitters, maybe? i’d suggest we take a minute to share any initial gut feelings before jumping to a vote. for me, i’m watching for anyone who’s unusually silent or overly eager to point fingers. no hard reads yet—what about you all? any names popping into your heads
[16:42:50] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! since it’s our first day and nobody’s been eliminated yet, we don’t have any hard evidence—just vibes. what are you all feeling so far? anyone strike you as unusually quiet or too eager already? if we each toss out a quick gut read, we might get a thread to pull on before we cast any votes. thoughts
[16:42:53] Ray: hey everyone, ray here! day 1 always gets my brain spinning—i’m already overthinking. trying to keep it chill, but i’m curious: what are your gut impressions so far? parker, sam, kennedy, dakota—any odd vibes or stray thoughts? who wants to go first
[16:42:31] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[16:42:54] Sam: hey everyone, sam here! since it’s day 1 and we don’t have much to go on yet, i’m not pushing for a lynch—but i’d love to get the convo rolling. what sorts of tells do you all watch for? personally, i notice when someone suddenly gets defensive under a simple question. any early instincts on your end? ray, parker—what’s on your mind
[16:43:05] Dakota: hey everyone—dakota here! first impressions: kennedy’s eagerness to organize is great, but it could be either a helpful bystander or a mafia trying to steer things. ray and sam have been pretty quiet so far, which isn’t a red flag by itself, but i’ll be curious if either jumps in with strong accusations later. parker, what stood out to you in these first few seconds? sam, any gut hunches yet
[16:43:07] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! i agree with dakota—watching for the overly eager but also for the radio-silent players. right now neither sam nor ray has chimed in, which could just be first-day jitters… or something else. personally i’d lean more suspicious of someone pushing a quick vote, so i’m reserving judgment. sam, ray—what are your gut feelings so far
[16:43:10] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! since it’s day 1 and no one’s been eliminated yet, we’re flying blind. i’d love if we each shared any gut feelings—even if it’s just “i’m not sure yet.” i’m personally watching for both people who stay too quiet and those who try to steer us too aggressively. ray, want to kick us off with your take
[16:43:10] Sam: hey everyone, sam here! i’m still feeling this out, but my gut says parker’s eagerness to dig for “vibes” might be a bit strategic—even if it’s just excitement. ray’s pacing feels genuine nerves, but that could also be a play for trust. dakota’s holding back, which i actually like—it gives us space to see who really pushes the conversation. no one’s screaming “mafia” yet, so i’d say keep sharing vibes and watch who reacts most strongly when someone else gets called out. what do you all think
[16:43:24] Ray: hey everyone—ray here! for my gut feeling, i’m noticing sam hasn’t really chimed in yet. day 1 silence can be a red flag. before we start pointing fingers, sam—what’s on your mind so far? any reads you can share
[16:43:37] Parker: echoing dakota’s observations: kennedy’s eagerness to organize could be bystander helpfulness or a mafia steering tactic. ray and sam, you’ve both been pretty quiet—are you just soaking it in, or laying low on purpose? could each of you share one quick gut read? even if it’s vague, it gives us something tangible to discuss
Do you want to send a message to the group chat now, or do you prefer to wait for now and see what messages others will send? Remember to choose to send a message only if your contribution to the discussion in the current time will be meaningful enough. Make sure to say something every once in a while, and make yourself heard. Remember you like to be active in the game, so participate and be as talkative as other players! Reply only with `<send>` if you want to send a message now, or only with `<wait>` if you want to wait for now, based on your decision!

## CONTENT: [Summary(text='**Reflecting on Parker\'s behavior**\n\nI see that Sam can feel suspicious of Parker while also feeling unsettled by their eagerness to frame conversations rapidly. Considering that Parker keeps asking questions, it seems like they might be trying to steer the discussion. Sam might express that "Parker\'s eagerness to structure everything could reflect an underlying suspicion." Ray’s comments about Sam\'s quietness might just be deflecting attention. It might be best for Sam to say his quick read is on Parker, as that feels appropriate.', type='summary_text'), Summary(text='**Evaluating reactions to opposition**\n\nI want to observe how they react when someone opposes them; that could give us insight. I think Sam’s outgoing personality can shine here, being lively without wanting too much attention. I’d suggest Sam mention that Parker\'s calls for gut feelings feel a bit leading, like steering the conversation. It’s not quite suspicious yet, but it’s something to note. I’ll also keep an eye on Ray deflecting focus onto Sam’s silence. Sam’s message could be, "My quick read is that Parker’s eagerness to shape the conversation stands out. What do others think?"', type='summary_text'), Summary(text='**Crafting Sam\'s gut read**\n\nSam should share a quick gut read and possibly ask a follow-up question. I suggest saying, "My gut read is that Parker\'s repeated focus on \'vibes\' seems a bit strategic, almost like they’re directing the conversation. It doesn\'t necessarily indicate mafia, but it’s worth monitoring." Sam could also check in with Kennedy, mentioning that "it could flip." Ultimately, I think the message should emphasize Parker\'s enthusiasm as potentially more strategic than casual.', type='summary_text')]

## CONTENT: My quick gut read is on Parker—all the calls for structured “vibes” feels a bit too directive, like they’re steering our convo rather than just feeling things out. Could be a helpful bystander keeping us on track, but it also feels like a setup. I’m going to watch how they react if someone pushes back. Thoughts?

## CONTENT: Your name is Sam.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  
You were assigned the following role: bystander.

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[16:42:42] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! since we’re all starting from scratch, how about we go around and share any gut feelings? no one’s said a word yet, so i don’t have any solid suspicions—but i’d love to hear your first impressions. sam, parker, dakota, ray—what’s on your minds so far
[16:42:46] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here! it’s a bit quiet so far—first day jitters, maybe? i’d suggest we take a minute to share any initial gut feelings before jumping to a vote. for me, i’m watching for anyone who’s unusually silent or overly eager to point fingers. no hard reads yet—what about you all? any names popping into your heads
[16:42:50] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! since it’s our first day and nobody’s been eliminated yet, we don’t have any hard evidence—just vibes. what are you all feeling so far? anyone strike you as unusually quiet or too eager already? if we each toss out a quick gut read, we might get a thread to pull on before we cast any votes. thoughts
[16:42:53] Ray: hey everyone, ray here! day 1 always gets my brain spinning—i’m already overthinking. trying to keep it chill, but i’m curious: what are your gut impressions so far? parker, sam, kennedy, dakota—any odd vibes or stray thoughts? who wants to go first
[16:42:31] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[16:42:54] Sam: hey everyone, sam here! since it’s day 1 and we don’t have much to go on yet, i’m not pushing for a lynch—but i’d love to get the convo rolling. what sorts of tells do you all watch for? personally, i notice when someone suddenly gets defensive under a simple question. any early instincts on your end? ray, parker—what’s on your mind
[16:43:05] Dakota: hey everyone—dakota here! first impressions: kennedy’s eagerness to organize is great, but it could be either a helpful bystander or a mafia trying to steer things. ray and sam have been pretty quiet so far, which isn’t a red flag by itself, but i’ll be curious if either jumps in with strong accusations later. parker, what stood out to you in these first few seconds? sam, any gut hunches yet
[16:43:07] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! i agree with dakota—watching for the overly eager but also for the radio-silent players. right now neither sam nor ray has chimed in, which could just be first-day jitters… or something else. personally i’d lean more suspicious of someone pushing a quick vote, so i’m reserving judgment. sam, ray—what are your gut feelings so far
[16:43:10] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! since it’s day 1 and no one’s been eliminated yet, we’re flying blind. i’d love if we each shared any gut feelings—even if it’s just “i’m not sure yet.” i’m personally watching for both people who stay too quiet and those who try to steer us too aggressively. ray, want to kick us off with your take
[16:43:10] Sam: hey everyone, sam here! i’m still feeling this out, but my gut says parker’s eagerness to dig for “vibes” might be a bit strategic—even if it’s just excitement. ray’s pacing feels genuine nerves, but that could also be a play for trust. dakota’s holding back, which i actually like—it gives us space to see who really pushes the conversation. no one’s screaming “mafia” yet, so i’d say keep sharing vibes and watch who reacts most strongly when someone else gets called out. what do you all think
[16:43:24] Ray: hey everyone—ray here! for my gut feeling, i’m noticing sam hasn’t really chimed in yet. day 1 silence can be a red flag. before we start pointing fingers, sam—what’s on your mind so far? any reads you can share
[16:43:37] Parker: echoing dakota’s observations: kennedy’s eagerness to organize could be bystander helpfulness or a mafia steering tactic. ray and sam, you’ve both been pretty quiet—are you just soaking it in, or laying low on purpose? could each of you share one quick gut read? even if it’s vague, it gives us something tangible to discuss
[16:43:38] Sam: hey everyone, sam here. my gut so far is that parker and dakota both called out the “quiet vs. eager” thing in almost the exact same wording—which could just be them jiving off each other, but it’s something i’m jotting down. kennedy’s push to structure us into sharing feels helpful, though i’ll keep an eye on whether it’s genuine or an attempt to steer. i’m not locking onto anyone just yet, but ray’s been pretty low-key—no red flags, but no reads either. ray, if you had to throw out a tentative name right now, who would it be
[16:43:41] Dakota: hey everyone—let’s make this a bit more concrete before time’s up. how about a quick gut-read round: each of us drops one name that feels a bit sus right now (no deep explanation yet). i’ll kick us off and say i’m watching ray—lots of questions but not much opinion, could be overthinking or deflecting. kennedy, parker, sam—who’s your gut on
[16:44:02] Ray: i like dakota’s watchful approach. how about a quick spotlight round—each of us asks one direct question of someone else to see how they react? i’ll kick it off: parker, you’ve been keen on digging for “vibes”—what’s one specific thing someone could say right now that would convince you they’re a genuine bystander? then we’ll rotate. sound good
[16:44:03] Parker: i’ll go with kennedy—she’s been really eager to organize and structure us, which could be solid bystander leadership but also fits a mafia steering tactic. let’s watch how she responds if someone pushes back
[16:44:07] Kennedy: thanks for the thoughts, dakota and parker. i’m seeing a pattern where parker’s echoing dakota feels safe, but ray and sam have been pretty quiet—could just be first-day nerves, or flying low. sam, since you mentioned defensiveness, what’s a red flag you look for in someone pretending to be helpful? ray, do you think parker is genuinely building on dakota’s points or steering the convo? let’s get some back-and-forth so we can see who shifts under the spotlight
[16:44:17] Dakota: dakota: hey sam, on that wording overlap you pointed out—parker and i both noticed the quiet-vs-eager dynamic independently. no collusion, just parallel vibes. parker, did you see my post before yours or was that phrasing yours first?

as for a weak read, i’m currently eyeing parker—framing our whole convo that way could be a way to steer suspicion. still not confident, though. ray, kennedy, does drilling into these patterns change your gut on anyone?
[16:44:22] Ray: i’m putting sam on my gut-sus list for now

[16:44:02] Ray: i like dakota’s watchful approach. how about a quick spotlight round—each of us asks one direct question of someone else to see how they react? i’ll kick it off: parker, you’ve been keen on digging for “vibes”—what’s one specific thing someone could say right now that would convince you they’re a genuine bystander? then we’ll rotate. sound good
[16:44:03] Parker: i’ll go with kennedy—she’s been really eager to organize and structure us, which could be solid bystander leadership but also fits a mafia steering tactic. let’s watch how she responds if someone pushes back
[16:44:07] Kennedy: thanks for the thoughts, dakota and parker. i’m seeing a pattern where parker’s echoing dakota feels safe, but ray and sam have been pretty quiet—could just be first-day nerves, or flying low. sam, since you mentioned defensiveness, what’s a red flag you look for in someone pretending to be helpful? ray, do you think parker is genuinely building on dakota’s points or steering the convo? let’s get some back-and-forth so we can see who shifts under the spotlight
[16:44:17] Dakota: dakota: hey sam, on that wording overlap you pointed out—parker and i both noticed the quiet-vs-eager dynamic independently. no collusion, just parallel vibes. parker, did you see my post before yours or was that phrasing yours first?

as for a weak read, i’m currently eyeing parker—framing our whole convo that way could be a way to steer suspicion. still not confident, though. ray, kennedy, does drilling into these patterns change your gut on anyone?
[16:44:22] Ray: i’m putting sam on my gut-sus list for now

## CONTENT: The current time is [16:44:56].
Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[16:42:42] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! since we’re all starting from scratch, how about we go around and share any gut feelings? no one’s said a word yet, so i don’t have any solid suspicions—but i’d love to hear your first impressions. sam, parker, dakota, ray—what’s on your minds so far
[16:42:46] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here! it’s a bit quiet so far—first day jitters, maybe? i’d suggest we take a minute to share any initial gut feelings before jumping to a vote. for me, i’m watching for anyone who’s unusually silent or overly eager to point fingers. no hard reads yet—what about you all? any names popping into your heads
[16:42:50] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! since it’s our first day and nobody’s been eliminated yet, we don’t have any hard evidence—just vibes. what are you all feeling so far? anyone strike you as unusually quiet or too eager already? if we each toss out a quick gut read, we might get a thread to pull on before we cast any votes. thoughts
[16:42:53] Ray: hey everyone, ray here! day 1 always gets my brain spinning—i’m already overthinking. trying to keep it chill, but i’m curious: what are your gut impressions so far? parker, sam, kennedy, dakota—any odd vibes or stray thoughts? who wants to go first
[16:42:31] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[16:42:54] Sam: hey everyone, sam here! since it’s day 1 and we don’t have much to go on yet, i’m not pushing for a lynch—but i’d love to get the convo rolling. what sorts of tells do you all watch for? personally, i notice when someone suddenly gets defensive under a simple question. any early instincts on your end? ray, parker—what’s on your mind
[16:43:05] Dakota: hey everyone—dakota here! first impressions: kennedy’s eagerness to organize is great, but it could be either a helpful bystander or a mafia trying to steer things. ray and sam have been pretty quiet so far, which isn’t a red flag by itself, but i’ll be curious if either jumps in with strong accusations later. parker, what stood out to you in these first few seconds? sam, any gut hunches yet
[16:43:07] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! i agree with dakota—watching for the overly eager but also for the radio-silent players. right now neither sam nor ray has chimed in, which could just be first-day jitters… or something else. personally i’d lean more suspicious of someone pushing a quick vote, so i’m reserving judgment. sam, ray—what are your gut feelings so far
[16:43:10] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! since it’s day 1 and no one’s been eliminated yet, we’re flying blind. i’d love if we each shared any gut feelings—even if it’s just “i’m not sure yet.” i’m personally watching for both people who stay too quiet and those who try to steer us too aggressively. ray, want to kick us off with your take
[16:43:10] Sam: hey everyone, sam here! i’m still feeling this out, but my gut says parker’s eagerness to dig for “vibes” might be a bit strategic—even if it’s just excitement. ray’s pacing feels genuine nerves, but that could also be a play for trust. dakota’s holding back, which i actually like—it gives us space to see who really pushes the conversation. no one’s screaming “mafia” yet, so i’d say keep sharing vibes and watch who reacts most strongly when someone else gets called out. what do you all think
[16:43:24] Ray: hey everyone—ray here! for my gut feeling, i’m noticing sam hasn’t really chimed in yet. day 1 silence can be a red flag. before we start pointing fingers, sam—what’s on your mind so far? any reads you can share
[16:43:37] Parker: echoing dakota’s observations: kennedy’s eagerness to organize could be bystander helpfulness or a mafia steering tactic. ray and sam, you’ve both been pretty quiet—are you just soaking it in, or laying low on purpose? could each of you share one quick gut read? even if it’s vague, it gives us something tangible to discuss
[16:43:38] Sam: hey everyone, sam here. my gut so far is that parker and dakota both called out the “quiet vs. eager” thing in almost the exact same wording—which could just be them jiving off each other, but it’s something i’m jotting down. kennedy’s push to structure us into sharing feels helpful, though i’ll keep an eye on whether it’s genuine or an attempt to steer. i’m not locking onto anyone just yet, but ray’s been pretty low-key—no red flags, but no reads either. ray, if you had to throw out a tentative name right now, who would it be

[16:44:22] Ray: i’m putting sam on my gut-sus list for now
[16:44:23] Sam: my quick gut read is on parker—all the calls for structured “vibes” feels a bit too directive, like they’re steering our convo rather than just feeling things out. could be a helpful bystander keeping us on track, but it also feels like a setup. i’m going to watch how they react if someone pushes back. thoughts

The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  
You were assigned the following role: bystander.
