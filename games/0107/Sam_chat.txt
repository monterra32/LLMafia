[16:40:44] Sam: hey everyone, i’m sam! i don’t have any strong reads yet, so i’m curious—should we go around and share who we find most suspicious and why? ray, want to kick us off
[16:40:49] Sam: hey everyone! first day here and since nobody got popped last night, we don’t have any hard leads yet. how about we each share a quick gut read before the voting starts? i’ll go first: parker’s been pretty quiet so far—could be a strategy, could be nothing, but worth noting. ray, what’s your initial take
[16:41:03] Sam: hey everyone, sam here! i’m probably overthinking since it’s so early, but parker being unusually quiet is standing out to me—usually they’d crack a joke or two by now. ray, i like your questions, but do you have any gut hunches yet? dakota, what are you picking up so far
