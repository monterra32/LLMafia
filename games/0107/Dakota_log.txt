The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  +

## CONTENT: Your name is Dakota.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [16:40:22].
The other players in the game are:

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.

Do you want to send a message to the group chat now, or do you prefer to wait for now and see what messages others will send? Remember to choose to send a message only if your contribution to the discussion in the current time will be meaningful enough. Make sure to say something every once in a while, and make yourself heard. Remember you like to be active in the game, so participate and be as talkative as other players! Reply only with `<send>` if you want to send a message now, or only with `<wait>` if you want to wait for now, based on your decision!

[16:40:44] Sam: hey everyone, i’m sam! i don’t have any strong reads yet, so i’m curious—should we go around and share who we find most suspicious and why? ray, want to kick us off
[16:40:45] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! since we didn’t get a night kill, we don’t have direct clues yet—so i’m planning to watch who’s too quiet or too quick to jump in. how about you all? any early gut feelings or strategies for this day 1 vote
[16:40:47] Dakota: hey everyone! since it’s day 1 and we don’t have any hard clues yet, i’d like to kick things off by having each of us name one person we find a bit shady—and why. i’ll go first: i’m a little suspicious of parker because they’ve been pretty quiet so far. ray, sam, kennedy—who’s on your radar, and what’s your reasoning
[16:40:47] Ray: hey everyone! ray here—super excited for day 1. since we have zero night intel, how about a quick round-robin: each of us names the one person we find most suspicious so far. i’ll kick us off—i’m watching kennedy because she’s been awfully quiet. kennedy, what do you think
[16:40:49] Sam: hey everyone! first day here and since nobody got popped last night, we don’t have any hard leads yet. how about we each share a quick gut read before the voting starts? i’ll go first: parker’s been pretty quiet so far—could be a strategy, could be nothing, but worth noting. ray, what’s your initial take
[16:40:54] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! excited to get started. since it’s day 1 and we have zero info so far, i’m not in favor of a random lynch—i'd rather let some conversation flow first. how about we each share our day 1 play style or strategy? for example, i like to listen for inconsistencies before pointing fingers. what’s your usual approach
[16:40:55] Kennedy: hey everyone, i’m kennedy—excited to play! day 1’s always a blank slate, so i’m all ears: who wants to kick things off with a first hunch or gut feeling
[16:40:58] Ray: hey everyone, ray here! excited for day 1. since we’ve got no hard info yet, i’m curious—does anyone have a gut feeling on who’s giving off weird vibes? i’ll admit i’m a bit thrown by sam’s quiet edge so far. what are your reads
