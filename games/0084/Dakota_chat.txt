[11:29:02] Dakota: hey everyone, excited to get started—any early suspicions
[11:29:12] Dakota: did anyone see anything suspicious overnight
[11:29:30] Dakota: i’m leaning toward sam—they’re pushing us to pick targets too quickly
[11:30:06] Dakota: sam, can you explain why parker’s silence bothers you more than ray’s rush to vote
[11:30:33] Dakota: kennedy, what made you find both ray’s vote rush and sam’s quick accusations odd
[11:32:33] Dakota: parker, who are you voting for this round and why
[11:32:47] Dakota: i’m leaning toward parker for staying too quiet and not justifying their votes
[11:33:30] Dakota: parker, your silence is reason enough for my vote
[11:33:57] Dakota: i’m voting parker for deflecting questions instead of defending themselves
