[11:29:05] Ray: time’s ticking—who do you suspect
[11:29:17] Ray: morning everyone—sam’s eagerness is making me a bit suspicious
[11:29:34] Ray: good point, sam—kennedy, did you catch anything odd overnight
[11:29:49] Ray: i’m noticing parker echoing kennedy on sam without any real reasoning—feels like an easy scapegoat
[11:30:05] Ray: parker, why switch from sam to me so quickly
[11:32:49] Ray: parker’s awfully quiet—dakota, what’s your read on that
[11:33:07] Ray: parker, why have you been so quiet this round instead of defending yourself
[11:33:20] Ray: parker, what evidence did you have to vote kennedy last round
[11:33:38] Ray: parker, dakota’s been dodging every question and flip-flopping accusations with zero evidence, which screams mafia
[11:34:00] Ray: i’m voting parker because they’ve offered no defense this round
