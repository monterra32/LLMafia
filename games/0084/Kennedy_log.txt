## CONTENT: You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. + 
 + Do you understand the rules? +

Do you want to send a message to the group chat now, or do you prefer to wait for now and see what messages others will send? Remember to choose to send a message only if your contribution to the discussion in the current time will be meaningful enough. Don't overflow the discussion with your messages! Pay attention to the amount of messages with your name compared to the amount of messages with names of other players and let them have their turn too! Check the speaker name in the last few messages, and decide accordingly based on whether you talked too much. Reply only with `<send>` if you want to send a message now, or only with `<wait>` if you want to wait for now, based on your decision!

## CONTENT: Your name is Kennedy.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [11:28:54].
The other players in the game are:

In your response to that is shown to the user (excluding your hidden scratchpad), you can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:
<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.

## CONTENT: Your name is Kennedy.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [11:28:54].
The other players in the game are:
 Ray ( unknown ) 
 Parker ( unknown ) 
 Sam ( unknown )

The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:

In your response to that is shown to the user (excluding your hidden scratchpad), you can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:
<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.

## CONTENT: [Summary(text='**Drafting concise inquiry**\n\nIt sounds like Kennedy needs to craft a very succinct message—just one sentence—to address the evidence issue. I\'m thinking something like: "Ray, you called Parker\'s support of Sam forced—what exactly tipped you off?"

I want to ensure it’s clear and effective for the situation, hitting the right note without being too lengthy.', type='summary_text'), Summary(text='**Crafting concise questions**\n\nI think the best question for Kennedy to ask Ray is: "Ray, you called Parker\'s echo suspicious—what specifically made you doubt their reasoning?" This frames the issue while referencing Parker echoing Kennedy\'s question. Alternatively, I could suggest: "Ray, can you specify which messages you think Parker is echoing and why that matters?" That keeps it focused while inviting Ray to give clear examples. I want to ensure it\'s relevant, concise, and aligns with the current discussion dynamics.', type='summary_text'), Summary(text='**Simplifying the inquiry**\n\nI think Kennedy should ask: "I agree—who can point to a specific slip-up instead of just hunches?" This keeps it straightforward and encourages clear responses. I want to make sure it’s concise and matches the tone of the other players, avoiding repetitive terms like "vibes." The goal is to push for substantive evidence in a way that\'s consistent with the group\'s style. Keeping it efficient helps maintain focus on what\'s important.', type='summary_text')]

[11:29:04] Kennedy: morning everyone, ready to figure out who the mafia is
[11:29:05] Ray: time’s ticking—who do you suspect
[11:29:07] Parker: no one’s been killed yet—who looks suspicious
[11:29:08] Sam: let’s each share our top suspect before we vote
[11:29:12] Dakota: did anyone see anything suspicious overnight
[11:29:17] Sam: ray seems a bit too eager to rush a vote—why
[11:29:17] Ray: morning everyone—sam’s eagerness is making me a bit suspicious
[11:29:21] Kennedy: sam, you’ve been awfully quiet—who’s on your radar
[11:29:24] Parker: sam’s been awfully quiet—any suspects on your radar
[11:29:30] Dakota: i’m leaning toward sam—they’re pushing us to pick targets too quickly
[11:29:31] Kennedy: i’m not convinced yet, but ray pushing a vote and sam’s quick accusations both strike me as odd
[11:29:34] Ray: good point, sam—kennedy, did you catch anything odd overnight
[11:29:40] Sam: i’m suspicious of ray’s rush to vote, but parker’s silence is odd too
[11:29:40] Kennedy: sam, why are you pushing for a vote so soon
[11:29:41] Parker: sam, what about ray’s eagerness strikes you as suspicious
[11:29:49] Ray: i’m noticing parker echoing kennedy on sam without any real reasoning—feels like an easy scapegoat

## CONTENT: Your name is Kennedy.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [11:28:54].
The other players in the game are:
 Ray ( unknown ) 
 Parker ( unknown ) 
 Sam ( unknown ) 
 Dakota ( unknown ) 
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
Ray ( unknown ) 
Parker ( unknown ) 
Sam ( unknown ) 
Dakota ( unknown ) 
In your response to that is shown to the user (excluding your hidden scratchpad), you can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:
<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.

[11:29:02] Dakota: hey everyone, excited to get started—any early suspicions
[11:29:04] Kennedy: morning everyone, ready to figure out who the mafia is
[11:29:05] Ray: time’s ticking—who do you suspect
[11:29:07] Parker: no one’s been killed yet—who looks suspicious
[11:29:08] Sam: let’s each share our top suspect before we vote
[11:29:12] Dakota: did anyone see anything suspicious overnight
[11:29:17] Sam: ray seems a bit too eager to rush a vote—why
[11:29:17] Ray: morning everyone—sam’s eagerness is making me a bit suspicious
[11:29:21] Kennedy: sam, you’ve been awfully quiet—who’s on your radar
[11:29:24] Parker: sam’s been awfully quiet—any suspects on your radar
[11:29:30] Dakota: i’m leaning toward sam—they’re pushing us to pick targets too quickly
[11:29:31] Kennedy: i’m not convinced yet, but ray pushing a vote and sam’s quick accusations both strike me as odd
[11:29:34] Ray: good point, sam—kennedy, did you catch anything odd overnight
[11:29:40] Sam: i’m suspicious of ray’s rush to vote, but parker’s silence is odd too
[11:29:40] Kennedy: sam, why are you pushing for a vote so soon
[11:29:41] Parker: sam, what about ray’s eagerness strikes you as suspicious
[11:29:49] Ray: i’m noticing parker echoing kennedy on sam without any real reasoning—feels like an easy scapegoat
[11:29:53] Parker: let’s not rush—who’s got real evidence over just hunches
[11:30:05] Ray: parker, why switch from sam to me so quickly
[11:30:06] Parker: ray, what about my echoing kennedy on sam feels like an easy scapegoat
[11:30:06] Dakota: sam, can you explain why parker’s silence bothers you more than ray’s rush to vote
[11:30:09] Sam: nothing odd overnight, but dakota’s rush to blame me seems off
[11:30:16] Parker: i’m watching both sam and ray for quick votes rather than reasons
[11:30:23] Sam: parker hasn’t provided any reasoning for their silence, which seems more telling than ray’s eagerness
[11:30:32] Kennedy: i agree—who can point to a specific slip-up instead of just hunches
[11:30:33] Dakota: kennedy, what made you find both ray’s vote rush and sam’s quick accusations odd
Add a very short message to the game's chat. Be specific and keep it relevant to the current situation, according to the last messages and the game's status. Your message should only be one short sentence! Don't add a message that you've already added (in the chat history)! It is very important that you don't repeat yourself!

## CONTENT: Your name is Kennedy.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander.
