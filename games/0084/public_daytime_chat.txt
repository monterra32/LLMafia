[11:29:02] Dakota: hey everyone, excited to get started—any early suspicions
[11:29:04] Kennedy: morning everyone, ready to figure out who the mafia is
[11:29:05] Ray: time’s ticking—who do you suspect
[11:29:07] Parker: no one’s been killed yet—who looks suspicious
[11:29:08] Sam: let’s each share our top suspect before we vote
[11:29:12] Dakota: did anyone see anything suspicious overnight
[11:29:17] Sam: ray seems a bit too eager to rush a vote—why
[11:29:17] Ray: morning everyone—sam’s eagerness is making me a bit suspicious
[11:29:21] Kennedy: sam, you’ve been awfully quiet—who’s on your radar
[11:29:24] Parker: sam’s been awfully quiet—any suspects on your radar
[11:29:30] Dakota: i’m leaning toward sam—they’re pushing us to pick targets too quickly
[11:29:31] Kennedy: i’m not convinced yet, but ray pushing a vote and sam’s quick accusations both strike me as odd
[11:29:34] Ray: good point, sam—kennedy, did you catch anything odd overnight
[11:29:40] Sam: i’m suspicious of ray’s rush to vote, but parker’s silence is odd too
[11:29:40] Kennedy: sam, why are you pushing for a vote so soon
[11:29:41] Parker: sam, what about ray’s eagerness strikes you as suspicious
[11:29:49] Ray: i’m noticing parker echoing kennedy on sam without any real reasoning—feels like an easy scapegoat
[11:29:53] Parker: let’s not rush—who’s got real evidence over just hunches
[11:30:05] Ray: parker, why switch from sam to me so quickly
[11:30:06] Parker: ray, what about my echoing kennedy on sam feels like an easy scapegoat
[11:30:06] Dakota: sam, can you explain why parker’s silence bothers you more than ray’s rush to vote
[11:30:09] Sam: nothing odd overnight, but dakota’s rush to blame me seems off
[11:30:16] Parker: i’m watching both sam and ray for quick votes rather than reasons
[11:30:23] Sam: parker hasn’t provided any reasoning for their silence, which seems more telling than ray’s eagerness
[11:30:32] Kennedy: i agree—who can point to a specific slip-up instead of just hunches
[11:30:33] Dakota: kennedy, what made you find both ray’s vote rush and sam’s quick accusations odd
[11:30:44] Sam: parker, which of my messages pressed for a vote instead of giving reasons
[11:30:54] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...

[11:32:24] Parker: dakota, who are you leaning toward now that two innocents are gone
[11:32:33] Dakota: parker, who are you voting for this round and why
[11:32:47] Dakota: i’m leaning toward parker for staying too quiet and not justifying their votes
[11:32:49] Ray: parker’s awfully quiet—dakota, what’s your read on that
[11:33:07] Ray: parker, why have you been so quiet this round instead of defending yourself
[11:33:13] Parker: ray, why are you so sure dakota is mafia this round
[11:33:20] Ray: parker, what evidence did you have to vote kennedy last round
[11:33:30] Dakota: parker, your silence is reason enough for my vote
[11:33:31] Parker: i’ve been gathering thoughts—ray, who will you vote for this round and why
[11:33:38] Ray: parker, dakota’s been dodging every question and flip-flopping accusations with zero evidence, which screams mafia
[11:33:47] Parker: dakota, what evidence beyond my silence justifies your vote
[11:33:57] Dakota: i’m voting parker for deflecting questions instead of defending themselves
[11:34:00] Ray: i’m voting parker because they’ve offered no defense this round
[11:34:01] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
