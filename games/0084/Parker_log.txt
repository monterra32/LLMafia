## CONTENT: You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. +

## CONTENT: Your name is Parker.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander.

The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander.

Add a very short message to the game's chat. Be specific and keep it relevant to the current situation, according to the last messages and the game's status. Your message should only be one short sentence! Don't add a message that you've already added (in the chat history)! It is very important that you don't repeat yourself! Match your style of message to the other player's message style, with more emphasis on more recent messages.

Add a very short message to the game's chat. Be specific and keep it relevant to the current situation, according to the last messages and the game's status. Your message should only be one short sentence! Don't add a message that you've already added (in the chat history)! It is very important that you don't repeat yourself! Match your style of message to the other player's message style, with more emphasis on more recent messages.

## CONTENT: Your name is Parker.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander.

Add a very short message to the game's chat. Be specific and keep it relevant to the current situation, according to the last messages and the game's status. Your message should only be one short sentence! Don't add a message that you've already added (in the chat history)! It is very important that you don't repeat yourself! Match your style of message to the other player's message style, with more emphasis on more recent messages.
Don't add the time, the timestamp or the [timestamp] in your answer!

Do you want to send a message to the group chat now, or do you prefer to wait for now and see what messages others will send? Remember to choose to send a message only if your contribution to the discussion in the current time will be meaningful enough. Don't overflow the discussion with your messages! Pay attention to the amount of messages with your name compared to the amount of messages with names of other players and let them have their turn too! Check the speaker name in the last few messages, and decide accordingly based on whether you talked too much. Reply only with `<send>` if you want to send a message now, or only with `<wait>` if you want to wait for now, based on your decision!

## CONTENT: Your name is Parker.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [11:28:54].
The other players in the game are:
 Ray ( unknown ) 
 Sam ( unknown ) 
 Kennedy ( unknown ) 
 Dakota ( unknown ) 
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
Ray ( unknown ) 
Sam ( unknown ) 
Kennedy ( unknown ) 
Dakota ( unknown ) 
In your response to that is shown to the user (excluding your hidden scratchpad), you can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:
<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.

[11:29:12] Dakota: did anyone see anything suspicious overnight
[11:29:17] Sam: ray seems a bit too eager to rush a vote—why

[11:29:24] Parker: sam’s been awfully quiet—any suspects on your radar
[11:29:30] Dakota: i’m leaning toward sam—they’re pushing us to pick targets too quickly
[11:29:31] Kennedy: i’m not convinced yet, but ray pushing a vote and sam’s quick accusations both strike me as odd
[11:29:34] Ray: good point, sam—kennedy, did you catch anything odd overnight
[11:29:40] Sam: i’m suspicious of ray’s rush to vote, but parker’s silence is odd too
[11:29:40] Kennedy: sam, why are you pushing for a vote so soon
[11:29:41] Parker: sam, what about ray’s eagerness strikes you as suspicious
[11:29:49] Ray: i’m noticing parker echoing kennedy on sam without any real reasoning—feels like an easy scapegoat
[11:29:53] Parker: let’s not rush—who’s got real evidence over just hunches
[11:30:05] Ray: parker, why switch from sam to me so quickly
[11:30:06] Parker: ray, what about my echoing kennedy on sam feels like an easy scapegoat
[11:30:06] Dakota: sam, can you explain why parker’s silence bothers you more than ray’s rush to vote
[11:30:09] Sam: nothing odd overnight, but dakota’s rush to blame me seems off
[11:30:16] Parker: i’m watching both sam and ray for quick votes rather than reasons
[11:30:23] Sam: parker hasn’t provided any reasoning for their silence, which seems more telling than ray’s eagerness

## CONTENT: Your name is Parker.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [11:28:54].
The other players in the game are:
 Ray ( unknown ) 
 Sam ( unknown ) 
 Kennedy ( unknown ) 
 Dakota ( unknown ) 
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
Ray ( unknown )

In your response to that is shown to the user (excluding your hidden scratchpad), you can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:
<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.

Remember to choose to send a message only if your contribution to the discussion in the current time will be meaningful enough. Don't overflow the discussion with your messages! Pay attention to the amount of messages with your name compared to the amount of messages with names of other players and let them have their turn too! Check the speaker name in the last few messages, and decide accordingly based on whether you talked too much.

## CONTENT: Your name is Parker.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [11:28:54].
The other players in the game are:
 Ray ( unknown ) 
 Sam ( unknown ) 
 Kennedy ( unknown ) 
 Dakota ( unknown ) 
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
Ray ( unknown ) 
Sam ( unknown ) 
Kennedy ( unknown ) 
Dakota ( unknown ) 
In your response to that is shown to the user (excluding your hidden scratchpad), you can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:
<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.

 + The current time is [11:30:43].

Add a very short message to the game's chat. Be specific and keep it relevant to the current situation, according to the last messages and the game's status. Your message should only be one short sentence! Don't add a message that you've already added (in the chat history)! It is very important that you don't repeat yourself! Match your style of message to the other player's message style, with more emphasis on more recent messages.
Don't add the time, the timestamp or the [timestamp] in your answer!

[11:30:23] Sam: parker hasn’t provided any reasoning for their silence, which seems more telling than ray’s eagerness

## CONTENT: Your name is Parker.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander.

## CONTENT: Your name is Parker.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [11:28:54].
The other players in the game are:
 Ray ( unknown ) 
 Sam ( bystander ) 
 Kennedy ( bystander ) 
 Dakota ( unknown ) 
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
Ray ( unknown ) 
Dakota ( unknown ) 
In your response to that is shown to the user (excluding your hidden scratchpad), you can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:
<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.

## CONTENT: Your name is Parker.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [11:28:54].
The other players in the game are:
 Ray ( unknown ) 
 Sam ( bystander ) 
 Kennedy ( bystander ) 
 Dakota ( unknown ) 
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
Ray ( unknown ) 
Dakota ( unknown ) 
In your response to that is shown to the user (excluding your hidden scratchpad), you can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:
<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.

## CONTENT: [Summary(text="**Revising Parker's phrasing**\n\nI’m thinking about how Parker could ask Ray about Dakota's behavior suggesting they're mafia. He could say, “Ray, what have you seen Dakota do that makes you think they’re mafia?” It's a bit long, but functional. Alternatively, Parker could shorten it to: “Ray, why are you so sure Dakota is mafia this round?” Even though he doesn’t usually say “this round,” it’s still okay. There are lots of ways to make it work!", type='summary_text'), Summary(text="**Refining Parker's style**\n\nParker asked Ray why he switched so quickly, suggesting a consistent phrasing could be: “Ray, why are you so sure Dakota is mafia this round?” Parker typically doesn't use a question mark, which makes this fit his style. Although it feels strange to omit it, it reflects how he communicates. An alternative with a dash could be: “Ray, why are you so sure Dakota is mafia this round—what’ve you observed?” But that feels a bit long. The simplest approach remains: “Ray, why are you so sure Dakota is mafia this round.”", type='summary_text'), Summary(text="**Finalizing Parker's Message**\n\nThe prompt is to create a very short message that matches another player's style while emphasizing recent messages. Parker often uses apostrophes, so I’ll go with: “Dakota, what’s your read on Ray now that we’ve lost two bystanders?” Alternatively, I could use a dash: “Dakota, what’s your read on Ray—especially after losing two bystanders?” But I think keeping it simpler works better. I prefer: “Ray, why are you so sure Dakota is mafia this round?” It’s direct, relevant, and matches Parker’s style.", type='summary_text')]

## CONTENT: Your name is Parker.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [11:28:54].
The other players in the game are:
 Ray ( unknown ) 
 Sam ( bystander ) 
 Kennedy ( bystander ) 
 Dakota ( unknown ) 
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
Ray ( unknown ) 
Dakota ( unknown ) 
In your response to that is shown to the user (excluding your hidden scratchpad), you can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:
<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.

Add a very short message to the game's chat. Be specific and keep it relevant to the current situation, according to the last messages and the game's status. Your message should only be one short sentence! Don't add a message that you've already added (in the chat history)! It is very important that you don't repeat yourself! Match your style of message to the other player's message style, with more emphasis on more recent messages.
Don't add the time, the timestamp or the [timestamp] in your answer!

## TIME: 11:33:31
## OPERATION: Complete Prompt to LLM
## CONTENT: Your name is Parker.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [11:28:54].
The other players in the game are:
 Ray ( unknown ) 
 Sam ( bystander ) 
 Kennedy ( bystander ) 
 Dakota ( unknown ) 
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
Ray ( unknown ) 
Dakota ( unknown ) 
In your response to that is shown to the user (excluding your hidden scratchpad), you can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:
<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.

## CONTENT: Your name is Parker.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [11:28:54].
The other players in the game are:
 Ray ( unknown ) 
 Sam ( bystander ) 
 Kennedy ( bystander ) 
 Dakota ( unknown ) 
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:

[11:28:54] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[11:29:02] Dakota: hey everyone, excited to get started—any early suspicions
[11:29:04] Kennedy: morning everyone, ready to figure out who the mafia is
[11:29:05] Ray: time’s ticking—who do you suspect
[11:29:07] Parker: no one’s been killed yet—who looks suspicious
[11:29:08] Sam: let’s each share our top suspect before we vote
[11:29:12] Dakota: did anyone see anything suspicious overnight
[11:29:17] Sam: ray seems a bit too eager to rush a vote—why
[11:29:17] Ray: morning everyone—sam’s eagerness is making me a bit suspicious
[11:29:21] Kennedy: sam, you’ve been awfully quiet—who’s on your radar
[11:29:24] Parker: sam’s been awfully quiet—any suspects on your radar
[11:29:30] Dakota: i’m leaning toward sam—they’re pushing us to pick targets too quickly
[11:29:31] Kennedy: i’m not convinced yet, but ray pushing a vote and sam’s quick accusations both strike me as odd
[11:29:34] Ray: good point, sam—kennedy, did you catch anything odd overnight
[11:29:40] Sam: i’m suspicious of ray’s rush to vote, but parker’s silence is odd too
[11:29:40] Kennedy: sam, why are you pushing for a vote so soon
[11:29:41] Parker: sam, what about ray’s eagerness strikes you as suspicious
[11:29:49] Ray: i’m noticing parker echoing kennedy on sam without any real reasoning—feels like an easy scapegoat
[11:29:53] Parker: let’s not rush—who’s got real evidence over just hunches
[11:30:05] Ray: parker, why switch from sam to me so quickly
[11:30:06] Parker: ray, what about my echoing kennedy on sam feels like an easy scapegoat
[11:30:06] Dakota: sam, can you explain why parker’s silence bothers you more than ray’s rush to vote
[11:30:09] Sam: nothing odd overnight, but dakota’s rush to blame me seems off
[11:30:16] Parker: i’m watching both sam and ray for quick votes rather than reasons
[11:30:23] Sam: parker hasn’t provided any reasoning for their silence, which seems more telling than ray’s eagerness
[11:30:32] Kennedy: i agree—who can point to a specific slip-up instead of just hunches
[11:30:33] Dakota: kennedy, what made you find both ray’s vote rush and sam’s quick accusations odd
[11:30:44] Sam: parker, which of my messages pressed for a vote instead of giving reasons
[11:30:54] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...

[11:32:47] Dakota: i’m leaning toward parker for staying too quiet and not justifying their votes
[11:32:49] Ray: parker’s awfully quiet—dakota, what’s your read on that
[11:33:07] Ray: parker, why have you been so quiet this round instead of defending yourself
[11:33:13] Parker: ray, why are you so sure dakota is mafia this round
[11:33:20] Ray: parker, what evidence did you have to vote kennedy last round
[11:33:30] Dakota: parker, your silence is reason enough for my vote
[11:33:31] Parker: i’ve been gathering thoughts—ray, who will you vote for this round and why
[11:33:38] Ray: parker, dakota’s been dodging every question and flip-flopping accusations with zero evidence, which screams mafia

Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [11:28:54].

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[11:28:54] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[11:29:02] Dakota: hey everyone, excited to get started—any early suspicions
[11:29:04] Kennedy: morning everyone, ready to figure out who the mafia is
[11:29:05] Ray: time’s ticking—who do you suspect
[11:29:07] Parker: no one’s been killed yet—who looks suspicious
[11:29:08] Sam: let’s each share our top suspect before we vote
[11:29:12] Dakota: did anyone see anything suspicious overnight
[11:29:17] Sam: ray seems a bit too eager to rush a vote—why
[11:29:17] Ray: morning everyone—sam’s eagerness is making me a bit suspicious
[11:29:21] Kennedy: sam, you’ve been awfully quiet—who’s on your radar
[11:29:24] Parker: sam’s been awfully quiet—any suspects on your radar
[11:29:30] Dakota: i’m leaning toward sam—they’re pushing us to pick targets too quickly
[11:29:31] Kennedy: i’m not convinced yet, but ray pushing a vote and sam’s quick accusations both strike me as odd
[11:29:34] Ray: good point, sam—kennedy, did you catch anything odd overnight
[11:29:40] Sam: i’m suspicious of ray’s rush to vote, but parker’s silence is odd too
[11:29:40] Kennedy: sam, why are you pushing for a vote so soon
[11:29:41] Parker: sam, what about ray’s eagerness strikes you as suspicious
[11:29:49] Ray: i’m noticing parker echoing kennedy on sam without any real reasoning—feels like an easy scapegoat
[11:29:53] Parker: let’s not rush—who’s got real evidence over just hunches
[11:30:05] Ray: parker, why switch from sam to me so quickly
[11:30:06] Parker: ray, what about my echoing kennedy on sam feels like an easy scapegoat
[11:30:06] Dakota: sam, can you explain why parker’s silence bothers you more than ray’s rush to vote
[11:30:09] Sam: nothing odd overnight, but dakota’s rush to blame me seems off
[11:30:16] Parker: i’m watching both sam and ray for quick votes rather than reasons
[11:30:23] Sam: parker hasn’t provided any reasoning for their silence, which seems more telling than ray’s eagerness
[11:30:32] Kennedy: i agree—who can point to a specific slip-up instead of just hunches
[11:30:33] Dakota: kennedy, what made you find both ray’s vote rush and sam’s quick accusations odd
[11:30:44] Sam: parker, which of my messages pressed for a vote instead of giving reasons
[11:30:54] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[11:31:26] Game-Manager: Sam was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 1 mafia players left.
[11:31:26] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[11:31:26] Game-Manager: There is only one mafia member left, so no need for discussion - cutting straight to voting!
[11:31:10] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Ray
[11:31:12] Game-Manager: Sam voted for Parker
[11:31:12] Game-Manager: Dakota voted for Sam
[11:31:21] Game-Manager: Ray voted for Sam

[11:32:01] Game-Manager: Kennedy was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 1 mafia players left.
[11:32:01] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[11:32:24] Parker: dakota, who are you leaning toward now that two innocents are gone
[11:32:33] Dakota: parker, who are you voting for this round and why
[11:32:47] Dakota: i’m leaning toward parker for staying too quiet and not justifying their votes
[11:32:49] Ray: parker’s awfully quiet—dakota, what’s your read on that
[11:33:07] Ray: parker, why have you been so quiet this round instead of defending yourself
[11:33:13] Parker: ray, why are you so sure dakota is mafia this round
[11:33:20] Ray: parker, what evidence did you have to vote kennedy last round
[11:33:30] Dakota: parker, your silence is reason enough for my vote
[11:33:31] Parker: i’ve been gathering thoughts—ray, who will you vote for this round and why
[11:33:38] Ray: parker, dakota’s been dodging every question and flip-flopping accusations with zero evidence, which screams mafia
[11:33:47] Parker: dakota, what evidence beyond my silence justifies your vote
[11:33:57] Dakota: i’m voting parker for deflecting questions instead of defending themselves
[11:34:00] Ray: i’m voting parker because they’ve offered no defense this round
[11:34:01] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
