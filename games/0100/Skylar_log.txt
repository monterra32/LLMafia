## CONTENT: You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  + 
 + Do you understand the rules? +

• Daytime: everyone discusses and votes to lynch one suspected mafia.  
• Nighttime: the mafia privately choose one bystander to eliminate.  
• Mafia win if they equal or outnumber the bystanders; bystanders win by lynching all mafia.

## CONTENT: Your name is Skylar.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [16:24:28].
The other players in the game are:
 Bailey ( unknown ) 
 Casey ( unknown ) 
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
Bailey ( unknown ) 
Casey ( unknown ) 
In your response to that is shown to the user (excluding your hidden scratchpad), you can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:
<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.

 + The current time is [16:25:00].
Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[16:24:28] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[16:24:45] Skylar: hey bailey, hey casey! skylar here—i’m excited for day 1. we’ve got one mafia and two bystanders among us, and since nobody’s spoken yet, let’s break the ice: who are you both leaning toward and what makes you suspicious of them? i don’t have a strong read yet, so i’m really curious to hear your thoughts
[16:24:54] Bailey: hey everyone, bailey here. excited to get started! since it’s day 1, we’re light on leads. what are your initial reads? anybody feeling off to you yet? i’ll share mine right after hearing your thoughts
Do you want to send a message to the group chat now, or do you prefer to wait for now and see what messages others will send? Remember to choose to send a message only if your contribution to the discussion in the current time will be meaningful enough. Don't overflow the discussion with your messages! Pay attention to the amount of messages with your name compared to the amount of messages with names of other players and let them have their turn too! Check the speaker name in the last few messages, and decide accordingly based on whether you talked too much. Reply only with `<send>` if you want to send a message now, or only with `<wait>` if you want to wait for now, based on your decision!

The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  
You were assigned the following role: bystander.

## CONTENT: Your name is Skylar.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [16:24:28].
The other players in the game are:
 Bailey ( unknown )

The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
Bailey ( unknown )

<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.

[16:24:45] Skylar: hey bailey, hey casey! skylar here—i’m excited for day 1. we’ve got one mafia and two bystanders among us, and since nobody’s spoken yet, let’s break the ice: who are you both leaning toward and what makes you suspicious of them? i don’t have a strong read yet, so i’m really curious to hear your thoughts
[16:24:54] Bailey: hey everyone, bailey here. excited to get started! since it’s day 1, we’re light on leads. what are your initial reads? anybody feeling off to you yet? i’ll share mine right after hearing your thoughts
[16:25:00] Skylar: hey everyone! day 1’s just kicked off and nobody’s gone yet, so i’m holding off on voting until we get a feel for the table. what are your initial impressions? anything about how this game’s set up or just player vibes that seems off? bailey, casey—whoever wants to jump in first, i’m all ears
[16:25:20] Bailey: hey skylar (and casey!), i’m not really locked on anyone yet, but i’ll admit i’m leaning just a tad toward casey—day-1 turtling can sometimes be a mafia trick to fly under the radar. it’s a super flimsy read, though. skylar, what’s your take on casey’s low-key start? and casey, have you picked up anything in skylar’s vibe that feels off (or spot-on
[16:25:45] Skylar: hey bailey, i hear you—casey’s low-key start could be a classic day-1 turtle move, but it could also just be nerves. casey, what do you think about bailey’s turtle theory? and how do my posts feel to you so far—too eager, too cagey, or pretty normal? if we want to start gathering reads, we could even throw a soft vote on casey in a few minutes and see what he says in his defense. thoughts
Do you want to send a message to the group chat now, or do you prefer to wait for now and see what messages others will send? Remember to choose to send a message only if your contribution to the discussion in the current time will be meaningful enough. Don't overflow the discussion with your messages! Pay attention to the amount of messages with your name compared to the amount of messages with names of other players and let them have their turn too! Check the speaker name in the last few messages, and decide accordingly based on whether you talked too much.

## CONTENT: Your name is Skylar.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [16:24:28].
The other players in the game are:
 Bailey ( unknown ) 
 Casey ( unknown ) 
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
Bailey ( unknown )

In your response to that is shown to the user (excluding your hidden scratchpad), you can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:
<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.

[16:24:28] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[16:24:45] Skylar: hey bailey, hey casey! skylar here—i’m excited for day 1. we’ve got one mafia and two bystanders among us, and since nobody’s spoken yet, let’s break the ice: who are you both leaning toward and what makes you suspicious of them? i don’t have a strong read yet, so i’m really curious to hear your thoughts
[16:24:54] Bailey: hey everyone, bailey here. excited to get started! since it’s day 1, we’re light on leads. what are your initial reads? anybody feeling off to you yet? i’ll share mine right after hearing your thoughts
[16:25:00] Skylar: hey everyone! day 1’s just kicked off and nobody’s gone yet, so i’m holding off on voting until we get a feel for the table. what are your initial impressions? anything about how this game’s set up or just player vibes that seems off? bailey, casey—whoever wants to jump in first, i’m all ears
[16:25:20] Bailey: hey skylar (and casey!), i’m not really locked on anyone yet, but i’ll admit i’m leaning just a tad toward casey—day-1 turtling can sometimes be a mafia trick to fly under the radar. it’s a super flimsy read, though. skylar, what’s your take on casey’s low-key start? and casey, have you picked up anything in skylar’s vibe that feels off (or spot-on
[16:25:45] Skylar: hey bailey, i hear you—casey’s low-key start could be a classic day-1 turtle move, but it could also just be nerves. casey, what do you think about bailey’s turtle theory? and how do my posts feel to you so far—too eager, too cagey, or pretty normal? if we want to start gathering reads, we could even throw a soft vote on casey in a few minutes and see what he says in his defense. thoughts
Do you want to send a message to the group chat now, or do you prefer to wait for now and see what messages others will send? Remember to choose to send a message only if your contribution to the discussion in the current time will be meaningful enough. Don't overflow the discussion with your messages! Pay attention to the amount of messages with your name compared to the amount of messages with names of other players and let them have their turn too! Check the speaker name in the last few messages, and decide accordingly based on whether you talked too much. Reply only with `<send>` if you want to send a message now, or only with `<wait>` if you want to wait for now, based on your decision!

[16:24:28] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[16:24:45] Skylar: hey bailey, hey casey! skylar here—i’m excited for day 1. we’ve got one mafia and two bystanders among us, and since nobody’s spoken yet, let’s break the ice: who are you both leaning toward and what makes you suspicious of them? i don’t have a strong read yet, so i’m really curious to hear your thoughts
[16:24:54] Bailey: hey everyone, bailey here. excited to get started! since it’s day 1, we’re light on leads. what are your initial reads? anybody feeling off to you yet? i’ll share mine right after hearing your thoughts
[16:25:00] Skylar: hey everyone! day 1’s just kicked off and nobody’s gone yet, so i’m holding off on voting until we get a feel for the table. what are your initial impressions? anything about how this game’s set up or just player vibes that seems off? bailey, casey—whoever wants to jump in first, i’m all ears
[16:25:20] Bailey: hey skylar (and casey!), i’m not really locked on anyone yet, but i’ll admit i’m leaning just a tad toward casey—day-1 turtling can sometimes be a mafia trick to fly under the radar. it’s a super flimsy read, though. skylar, what’s your take on casey’s low-key start? and casey, have you picked up anything in skylar’s vibe that feels off (or spot-on
[16:25:45] Skylar: hey bailey, i hear you—casey’s low-key start could be a classic day-1 turtle move, but it could also just be nerves. casey, what do you think about bailey’s turtle theory? and how do my posts feel to you so far—too eager, too cagey, or pretty normal? if we want to start gathering reads, we could even throw a soft vote on casey in a few minutes and see what he says in his defense. thoughts
[16:26:28] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
From the following remaining players, which player you want to vote for to lynch? Base your answer on the conversation as seen in the message history, and especially on what you (Skylar) said.
