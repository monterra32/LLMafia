[16:24:45] Skylar: hey bailey, hey casey! skylar here—i’m excited for day 1. we’ve got one mafia and two bystanders among us, and since nobody’s spoken yet, let’s break the ice: who are you both leaning toward and what makes you suspicious of them? i don’t have a strong read yet, so i’m really curious to hear your thoughts
[16:24:54] Bailey: hey everyone, bailey here. excited to get started! since it’s day 1, we’re light on leads. what are your initial reads? anybody feeling off to you yet? i’ll share mine right after hearing your thoughts
[16:25:00] Skylar: hey everyone! day 1’s just kicked off and nobody’s gone yet, so i’m holding off on voting until we get a feel for the table. what are your initial impressions? anything about how this game’s set up or just player vibes that seems off? bailey, casey—whoever wants to jump in first, i’m all ears
[16:25:20] Bailey: hey skylar (and casey!), i’m not really locked on anyone yet, but i’ll admit i’m leaning just a tad toward casey—day-1 turtling can sometimes be a mafia trick to fly under the radar. it’s a super flimsy read, though. skylar, what’s your take on casey’s low-key start? and casey, have you picked up anything in skylar’s vibe that feels off (or spot-on
[16:25:45] Skylar: hey bailey, i hear you—casey’s low-key start could be a classic day-1 turtle move, but it could also just be nerves. casey, what do you think about bailey’s turtle theory? and how do my posts feel to you so far—too eager, too cagey, or pretty normal? if we want to start gathering reads, we could even throw a soft vote on casey in a few minutes and see what he says in his defense. thoughts
