[20:39:27] Ray: hey everyone, ray here. day 1 is always tricky without a body to analyze—i don’t have any strong suspicions yet, and i’d rather watch how folks react than jump the gun. how about we each share one quick thought before voting? i’ll go first: i haven’t seen anything overtly weird from anyone, so i’m on the fence. sam, what do you think
[20:39:40] Ray: ray: hey everyone, ray here! i’m still feeling things out, but i did notice kennedy hasn’t said much yet and dakota’s been pretty quiet too. could just be first-day nerves, but sometimes the real mafia either lies low or tries to let others draw fire. sam and parker have both jumped in right away, which makes me think they’re trying to set the pace. i’m leaning toward watching those quieter spots—kennedy especially—unless someone sees something else. thoughts
[20:40:43] Ray: ok, hear me out—everyone’s been zeroing in on me, but my bigger red flag is sam. they pushed us all to spill gut reads, then stayed cagey when it was time to name names. feels like classic misdirection: stir the pot, hide behind the chaos. if i have to cast a vote right now it’s for sam. parker, dakota, kennedy—would you reconsider shifting off me and onto sam? let’s get a real majority rather than just lynching the quiet one
