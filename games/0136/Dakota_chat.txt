[20:39:34] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here! it’s day 1 and we’ve got two minutes to pick someone. i think we should each share a quick gut feeling to get the ball rolling. i’ll start: i’m not picking up anything super obvious yet, but i noticed parker’s been pretty quiet. parker, what are you thinking? then ray, sam, kennedy—let’s hear your first impressions
[20:39:56] Dakota: dakota: hey everyone, dakota here! day 1 is always a bit of a blur—i haven’t spotted any glaring tells yet, but i did notice sam and parker both pushing for reads right off the bat. might just be first-day nerves, but it feels a bit proactive. curious what kennedy thinks so far. i’m holding off voting until we see someone slip up—anyone else pick up on something i missed
[20:40:16] Dakota: dakota: i’m feeling a bit wary of ray’s silence—first‐day quietness can be a mafia tactic—but sam’s eagerness to zero in on ray also feels a little pushy. parker’s questions seem genuine, and kennedy’s staying neutral for now. if i had to pick someone right now, i’d lean toward ray just to pressure some reads out of him, but i’m not locked in. how about we each drop one name we’d vote for if we had to decide now and see if any name pops up more than once
[20:40:41] Dakota: dakota: alright, my vote’s going to parker. jumping straight to frame ray without any concrete reads feels more like a misdirect than a genuine gut feel. parker—can you walk us through exactly what tipped you off? ray, sam, kennedy, any last-minute thoughts before we lock this in
