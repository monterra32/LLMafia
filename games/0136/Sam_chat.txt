[20:39:16] Sam: hey everyone, sam here! first day jitters are real—but let’s get the ball rolling. it’s awfully quiet so far; anyone have a gut feeling or notice something off in the silence? parker or ray, i’d love to hear your first impressions—what vibes are you picking up
[20:39:42] Sam: hey everyone, sam here! day 1 without a body to analyze means we’re flying blind, so let’s share initial gut reads. i’m curious about ray’s quiet start—sometimes laying low is exactly what mafia do. what about you all? parker, kennedy, dakota—anyone already eyeing someone
[20:40:14] Sam: alright, i’m going to hold off on my pick so i don’t steer the convo—dakota, kennedy, parker, ray, who’s your top suspect right now? drop a name (and a quick why) in the next 30 seconds, then i’ll share mine before we lock in votes
[20:40:38] Sam: looks like ray’s already picked up two mentions from parker and dakota, so i’m going to add my vote to ray—his first-day silence feels a bit convenient. kennedy, you’re our swing here: any last thoughts before we lock him in
