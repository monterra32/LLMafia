[20:39:25] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! excited to get started. i haven’t spotted anything too fishy yet, so i’d love to hear your initial gut reads before we start voting. ray, what’s your sense so far? sam? kennedy? dakota? let’s each drop one quick thought so we can narrow down our suspect list
[20:39:41] Parker: hey sam! parker here—definitely feeling the jitters too. i notice ray’s been pretty quiet so far. ray, what are you thinking? kennedy, dakota, do you guys have any early hunches? personally i’m not ready to vote anyone off yet, but let’s get those thoughts rolling—sometimes the quiet ones are hiding something, but maybe they’re just laying low. thoughts
[20:40:16] Parker: hey everyone, feeling the time crunch—here’s my gut: day 1 nerves likely explain the quiet vibes from kennedy/dakota, not mafia. i’m more curious about who’s framing that narrative—that’d be ray for me. i’m casting my vote for ray and watching the reactions. thoughts
[20:40:34] Parker: parker: i’m leaning toward kennedy—they’ve barely shared any real reads and seem happy to stay quiet. feels like a classic lay-low move
