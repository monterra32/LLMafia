The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  +

## CONTENT: Your name is Sam.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [20:39:03].
The other players in the game are:
 Ray ( unknown ) 
 Parker ( unknown ) 
 Kennedy ( unknown )

[20:39:16] Sam: hey everyone, sam here! first day jitters are real—but let’s get the ball rolling. it’s awfully quiet so far; anyone have a gut feeling or notice something off in the silence? parker or ray, i’d love to hear your first impressions—what vibes are you picking up
[20:39:25] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! excited to get started. i haven’t spotted anything too fishy yet, so i’d love to hear your initial gut reads before we start voting. ray, what’s your sense so far? sam? kennedy? dakota? let’s each drop one quick thought so we can narrow down our suspect list
[20:39:27] Ray: hey everyone, ray here. day 1 is always tricky without a body to analyze—i don’t have any strong suspicions yet, and i’d rather watch how folks react than jump the gun. how about we each share one quick thought before voting? i’ll go first: i haven’t seen anything overtly weird from anyone, so i’m on the fence. sam, what do you think
[20:39:34] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here! it’s day 1 and we’ve got two minutes to pick someone. i think we should each share a quick gut feeling to get the ball rolling. i’ll start: i’m not picking up anything super obvious yet, but i noticed parker’s been pretty quiet. parker, what are you thinking? then ray, sam, kennedy—let’s hear your first impressions
[20:39:38] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here—pumped for day 1! with just two minutes before votes lock in, let’s break the ice. i’m going to be watching for anyone who pours on the pressure too fast—pushing a vote early can be a red flag. i don’t have a solid read yet though. how’s everyone else approaching this first round
[20:39:40] Ray: ray: hey everyone, ray here! i’m still feeling things out, but i did notice kennedy hasn’t said much yet and dakota’s been pretty quiet too. could just be first-day nerves, but sometimes the real mafia either lies low or tries to let others draw fire. sam and parker have both jumped in right away, which makes me think they’re trying to set the pace. i’m leaning toward watching those quieter spots—kennedy especially—unless someone sees something else. thoughts
[20:39:41] Parker: hey sam! parker here—definitely feeling the jitters too. i notice ray’s been pretty quiet so far. ray, what are you thinking? kennedy, dakota, do you guys have any early hunches? personally i’m not ready to vote anyone off yet, but let’s get those thoughts rolling—sometimes the quiet ones are hiding something, but maybe they’re just laying low. thoughts
Do you want to send a message to the group chat now, or do you prefer to wait for now and see what messages others will send? Remember to choose to send a message only if your contribution to the discussion in the current time will be meaningful enough. Make sure to say something every once in a while, and make yourself heard. Remember you like to be active in the game, so participate and be as talkative as other players! Reply only with `<send>` if you want to send a message now, or only with `<wait>` if you want to wait for now, based on your decision!

## CONTENT: Your name is Sam.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [20:39:03].

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[20:39:03] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[20:39:16] Sam: hey everyone, sam here! first day jitters are real—but let’s get the ball rolling. it’s awfully quiet so far; anyone have a gut feeling or notice something off in the silence? parker or ray, i’d love to hear your first impressions—what vibes are you picking up
[20:39:25] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! excited to get started. i haven’t spotted anything too fishy yet, so i’d love to hear your initial gut reads before we start voting. ray, what’s your sense so far? sam? kennedy? dakota? let’s each drop one quick thought so we can narrow down our suspect list
[20:39:27] Ray: hey everyone, ray here. day 1 is always tricky without a body to analyze—i don’t have any strong suspicions yet, and i’d rather watch how folks react than jump the gun. how about we each share one quick thought before voting? i’ll go first: i haven’t seen anything overtly weird from anyone, so i’m on the fence. sam, what do you think
[20:39:34] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here! it’s day 1 and we’ve got two minutes to pick someone. i think we should each share a quick gut feeling to get the ball rolling. i’ll start: i’m not picking up anything super obvious yet, but i noticed parker’s been pretty quiet. parker, what are you thinking? then ray, sam, kennedy—let’s hear your first impressions
[20:39:38] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here—pumped for day 1! with just two minutes before votes lock in, let’s break the ice. i’m going to be watching for anyone who pours on the pressure too fast—pushing a vote early can be a red flag. i don’t have a solid read yet though. how’s everyone else approaching this first round
[20:39:40] Ray: ray: hey everyone, ray here! i’m still feeling things out, but i did notice kennedy hasn’t said much yet and dakota’s been pretty quiet too. could just be first-day nerves, but sometimes the real mafia either lies low or tries to let others draw fire. sam and parker have both jumped in right away, which makes me think they’re trying to set the pace. i’m leaning toward watching those quieter spots—kennedy especially—unless someone sees something else. thoughts
[20:39:41] Parker: hey sam! parker here—definitely feeling the jitters too. i notice ray’s been pretty quiet so far. ray, what are you thinking? kennedy, dakota, do you guys have any early hunches? personally i’m not ready to vote anyone off yet, but let’s get those thoughts rolling—sometimes the quiet ones are hiding something, but maybe they’re just laying low. thoughts
[20:39:42] Sam: hey everyone, sam here! day 1 without a body to analyze means we’re flying blind, so let’s share initial gut reads. i’m curious about ray’s quiet start—sometimes laying low is exactly what mafia do. what about you all? parker, kennedy, dakota—anyone already eyeing someone
[20:39:56] Dakota: dakota: hey everyone, dakota here! day 1 is always a bit of a blur—i haven’t spotted any glaring tells yet, but i did notice sam and parker both pushing for reads right off the bat. might just be first-day nerves, but it feels a bit proactive. curious what kennedy thinks so far. i’m holding off voting until we see someone slip up—anyone else pick up on something i missed

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[20:39:03] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[20:39:16] Sam: hey everyone, sam here! first day jitters are real—but let’s get the ball rolling. it’s awfully quiet so far; anyone have a gut feeling or notice something off in the silence? parker or ray, i’d love to hear your first impressions—what vibes are you picking up
[20:39:25] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! excited to get started. i haven’t spotted anything too fishy yet, so i’d love to hear your initial gut reads before we start voting. ray, what’s your sense so far? sam? kennedy? dakota? let’s each drop one quick thought so we can narrow down our suspect list
[20:39:27] Ray: hey everyone, ray here. day 1 is always tricky without a body to analyze—i don’t have any strong suspicions yet, and i’d rather watch how folks react than jump the gun. how about we each share one quick thought before voting? i’ll go first: i haven’t seen anything overtly weird from anyone, so i’m on the fence. sam, what do you think
[20:39:34] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here! it’s day 1 and we’ve got two minutes to pick someone. i think we should each share a quick gut feeling to get the ball rolling. i’ll start: i’m not picking up anything super obvious yet, but i noticed parker’s been pretty quiet. parker, what are you thinking? then ray, sam, kennedy—let’s hear your first impressions
[20:39:38] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here—pumped for day 1! with just two minutes before votes lock in, let’s break the ice. i’m going to be watching for anyone who pours on the pressure too fast—pushing a vote early can be a red flag. i don’t have a solid read yet though. how’s everyone else approaching this first round
[20:39:40] Ray: ray: hey everyone, ray here! i’m still feeling things out, but i did notice kennedy hasn’t said much yet and dakota’s been pretty quiet too. could just be first-day nerves, but sometimes the real mafia either lies low or tries to let others draw fire. sam and parker have both jumped in right away, which makes me think they’re trying to set the pace. i’m leaning toward watching those quieter spots—kennedy especially—unless someone sees something else. thoughts
[20:39:41] Parker: hey sam! parker here—definitely feeling the jitters too. i notice ray’s been pretty quiet so far. ray, what are you thinking? kennedy, dakota, do you guys have any early hunches? personally i’m not ready to vote anyone off yet, but let’s get those thoughts rolling—sometimes the quiet ones are hiding something, but maybe they’re just laying low. thoughts
[20:39:42] Sam: hey everyone, sam here! day 1 without a body to analyze means we’re flying blind, so let’s share initial gut reads. i’m curious about ray’s quiet start—sometimes laying low is exactly what mafia do. what about you all? parker, kennedy, dakota—anyone already eyeing someone
[20:39:56] Dakota: dakota: hey everyone, dakota here! day 1 is always a bit of a blur—i haven’t spotted any glaring tells yet, but i did notice sam and parker both pushing for reads right off the bat. might just be first-day nerves, but it feels a bit proactive. curious what kennedy thinks so far. i’m holding off voting until we see someone slip up—anyone else pick up on something i missed
[20:40:14] Sam: alright, i’m going to hold off on my pick so i don’t steer the convo—dakota, kennedy, parker, ray, who’s your top suspect right now? drop a name (and a quick why) in the next 30 seconds, then i’ll share mine before we lock in votes
[20:40:16] Parker: hey everyone, feeling the time crunch—here’s my gut: day 1 nerves likely explain the quiet vibes from kennedy/dakota, not mafia. i’m more curious about who’s framing that narrative—that’d be ray for me. i’m casting my vote for ray and watching the reactions. thoughts
[20:40:16] Dakota: dakota: i’m feeling a bit wary of ray’s silence—first‐day quietness can be a mafia tactic—but sam’s eagerness to zero in on ray also feels a little pushy. parker’s questions seem genuine, and kennedy’s staying neutral for now. if i had to pick someone right now, i’d lean toward ray just to pressure some reads out of him, but i’m not locked in. how about we each drop one name we’d vote for if we had to decide now and see if any name pops up more than once

## CONTENT: Your name is Sam.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  
You were assigned the following role: bystander.

[20:39:03] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[20:39:16] Sam: hey everyone, sam here! first day jitters are real—but let’s get the ball rolling. it’s awfully quiet so far; anyone have a gut feeling or notice something off in the silence? parker or ray, i’d love to hear your first impressions—what vibes are you picking up
[20:39:25] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! excited to get started. i haven’t spotted anything too fishy yet, so i’d love to hear your initial gut reads before we start voting. ray, what’s your sense so far? sam? kennedy? dakota? let’s each drop one quick thought so we can narrow down our suspect list

[20:40:16] Parker: hey everyone, feeling the time crunch—here’s my gut: day 1 nerves likely explain the quiet vibes from kennedy/dakota, not mafia. i’m more curious about who’s framing that narrative—that’d be ray for me. i’m casting my vote for ray and watching the reactions. thoughts
[20:40:16] Dakota: dakota: i’m feeling a bit wary of ray’s silence—first‐day quietness can be a mafia tactic—but sam’s eagerness to zero in on ray also feels a little pushy. parker’s questions seem genuine, and kennedy’s staying neutral for now. if i had to pick someone right now, i’d lean toward ray just to pressure some reads out of him, but i’m not locked in. how about we each drop one name we’d vote for if we had to decide now and see if any name pops up more than once
[20:40:29] Kennedy: kennedy: hey everyone—i want to break the stalemate with a quick forced vote. if you had to cast a vote right now, who would it be? i’m putting mine on ray just to see how people react. parker? sam? dakota? drop a name and let’s see if any consensus pops up
[20:40:34] Parker: parker: i’m leaning toward kennedy—they’ve barely shared any real reads and seem happy to stay quiet. feels like a classic lay-low move
Do you want to send a message to the group chat now, or do you prefer to wait for now and see what messages others will send? Remember to choose to send a message only if your contribution to the discussion in the current time will be meaningful enough. Don't overflow the discussion with your messages! Pay attention to the amount of messages with your name compared to the amount of messages with names of other players and let them have their turn too! Check the speaker name in the last few messages, and decide accordingly based on whether you talked too much.

[20:39:03] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[20:39:16] Sam: hey everyone, sam here! first day jitters are real—but let’s get the ball rolling. it’s awfully quiet so far; anyone have a gut feeling or notice something off in the silence? parker or ray, i’d love to hear your first impressions—what vibes are you picking up
[20:39:25] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! excited to get started. i haven’t spotted anything too fishy yet, so i’d love to hear your initial gut reads before we start voting. ray, what’s your sense so far? sam? kennedy? dakota? let’s each drop one quick thought so we can narrow down our suspect list
[20:39:27] Ray: hey everyone, ray here. day 1 is always tricky without a body to analyze—i don’t have any strong suspicions yet, and i’d rather watch how folks react than jump the gun. how about we each share one quick thought before voting? i’ll go first: i haven’t seen anything overtly weird from anyone, so i’m on the fence. sam, what do you think
[20:39:34] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here! it’s day 1 and we’ve got two minutes to pick someone. i think we should each share a quick gut feeling to get the ball rolling. i’ll start: i’m not picking up anything super obvious yet, but i noticed parker’s been pretty quiet. parker, what are you thinking? then ray, sam, kennedy—let’s hear your first impressions
[20:39:38] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here—pumped for day 1! with just two minutes before votes lock in, let’s break the ice. i’m going to be watching for anyone who pours on the pressure too fast—pushing a vote early can be a red flag. i don’t have a solid read yet though. how’s everyone else approaching this first round
[20:39:40] Ray: ray: hey everyone, ray here! i’m still feeling things out, but i did notice kennedy hasn’t said much yet and dakota’s been pretty quiet too. could just be first-day nerves, but sometimes the real mafia either lies low or tries to let others draw fire. sam and parker have both jumped in right away, which makes me think they’re trying to set the pace. i’m leaning toward watching those quieter spots—kennedy especially—unless someone sees something else. thoughts
[20:39:41] Parker: hey sam! parker here—definitely feeling the jitters too. i notice ray’s been pretty quiet so far. ray, what are you thinking? kennedy, dakota, do you guys have any early hunches? personally i’m not ready to vote anyone off yet, but let’s get those thoughts rolling—sometimes the quiet ones are hiding something, but maybe they’re just laying low. thoughts
[20:39:42] Sam: hey everyone, sam here! day 1 without a body to analyze means we’re flying blind, so let’s share initial gut reads. i’m curious about ray’s quiet start—sometimes laying low is exactly what mafia do. what about you all? parker, kennedy, dakota—anyone already eyeing someone
[20:39:56] Dakota: dakota: hey everyone, dakota here! day 1 is always a bit of a blur—i haven’t spotted any glaring tells yet, but i did notice sam and parker both pushing for reads right off the bat. might just be first-day nerves, but it feels a bit proactive. curious what kennedy thinks so far. i’m holding off voting until we see someone slip up—anyone else pick up on something i missed
[20:40:14] Sam: alright, i’m going to hold off on my pick so i don’t steer the convo—dakota, kennedy, parker, ray, who’s your top suspect right now? drop a name (and a quick why) in the next 30 seconds, then i’ll share mine before we lock in votes
[20:40:16] Parker: hey everyone, feeling the time crunch—here’s my gut: day 1 nerves likely explain the quiet vibes from kennedy/dakota, not mafia. i’m more curious about who’s framing that narrative—that’d be ray for me. i’m casting my vote for ray and watching the reactions. thoughts
[20:40:16] Dakota: dakota: i’m feeling a bit wary of ray’s silence—first‐day quietness can be a mafia tactic—but sam’s eagerness to zero in on ray also feels a little pushy. parker’s questions seem genuine, and kennedy’s staying neutral for now. if i had to pick someone right now, i’d lean toward ray just to pressure some reads out of him, but i’m not locked in. how about we each drop one name we’d vote for if we had to decide now and see if any name pops up more than once
[20:40:29] Kennedy: kennedy: hey everyone—i want to break the stalemate with a quick forced vote. if you had to cast a vote right now, who would it be? i’m putting mine on ray just to see how people react. parker? sam? dakota? drop a name and let’s see if any consensus pops up
[20:40:34] Parker: parker: i’m leaning toward kennedy—they’ve barely shared any real reads and seem happy to stay quiet. feels like a classic lay-low move

[20:40:38] Sam: looks like ray’s already picked up two mentions from parker and dakota, so i’m going to add my vote to ray—his first-day silence feels a bit convenient. kennedy, you’re our swing here: any last thoughts before we lock him in
[20:40:41] Dakota: dakota: alright, my vote’s going to parker. jumping straight to frame ray without any concrete reads feels more like a misdirect than a genuine gut feel. parker—can you walk us through exactly what tipped you off? ray, sam, kennedy, any last-minute thoughts before we lock this in
[20:40:43] Ray: ok, hear me out—everyone’s been zeroing in on me, but my bigger red flag is sam. they pushed us all to spill gut reads, then stayed cagey when it was time to name names. feels like classic misdirection: stir the pot, hide behind the chaos. if i have to cast a vote right now it’s for sam. parker, dakota, kennedy—would you reconsider shifting off me and onto sam? let’s get a real majority rather than just lynching the quiet one
[20:41:03] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[20:41:13] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Ray

[20:39:16] Sam: hey everyone, sam here! first day jitters are real—but let’s get the ball rolling. it’s awfully quiet so far; anyone have a gut feeling or notice something off in the silence? parker or ray, i’d love to hear your first impressions—what vibes are you picking up
[20:39:25] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! excited to get started. i haven’t spotted anything too fishy yet, so i’d love to hear your initial gut reads before we start voting. ray, what’s your sense so far? sam? kennedy? dakota? let’s each drop one quick thought so we can narrow down our suspect list
[20:39:27] Ray: hey everyone, ray here. day 1 is always tricky without a body to analyze—i don’t have any strong suspicions yet, and i’d rather watch how folks react than jump the gun. how about we each share one quick thought before voting? i’ll go first: i haven’t seen anything overtly weird from anyone, so i’m on the fence. sam, what do you think
[20:39:34] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here! it’s day 1 and we’ve got two minutes to pick someone. i think we should each share a quick gut feeling to get the ball rolling. i’ll start: i’m not picking up anything super obvious yet, but i noticed parker’s been pretty quiet. parker, what are you thinking? then ray, sam, kennedy—let’s hear your first impressions
[20:39:38] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here—pumped for day 1! with just two minutes before votes lock in, let’s break the ice. i’m going to be watching for anyone who pours on the pressure too fast—pushing a vote early can be a red flag. i don’t have a solid read yet though. how’s everyone else approaching this first round
[20:39:40] Ray: ray: hey everyone, ray here! i’m still feeling things out, but i did notice kennedy hasn’t said much yet and dakota’s been pretty quiet too. could just be first-day nerves, but sometimes the real mafia either lies low or tries to let others draw fire. sam and parker have both jumped in right away, which makes me think they’re trying to set the pace. i’m leaning toward watching those quieter spots—kennedy especially—unless someone sees something else. thoughts
[20:39:41] Parker: hey sam! parker here—definitely feeling the jitters too. i notice ray’s been pretty quiet so far. ray, what are you thinking? kennedy, dakota, do you guys have any early hunches? personally i’m not ready to vote anyone off yet, but let’s get those thoughts rolling—sometimes the quiet ones are hiding something, but maybe they’re just laying low. thoughts
[20:39:42] Sam: hey everyone, sam here! day 1 without a body to analyze means we’re flying blind, so let’s share initial gut reads. i’m curious about ray’s quiet start—sometimes laying low is exactly what mafia do. what about you all? parker, kennedy, dakota—anyone already eyeing someone
[20:39:56] Dakota: dakota: hey everyone, dakota here! day 1 is always a bit of a blur—i haven’t spotted any glaring tells yet, but i did notice sam and parker both pushing for reads right off the bat. might just be first-day nerves, but it feels a bit proactive. curious what kennedy thinks so far. i’m holding off voting until we see someone slip up—anyone else pick up on something i missed
[20:40:14] Sam: alright, i’m going to hold off on my pick so i don’t steer the convo—dakota, kennedy, parker, ray, who’s your top suspect right now? drop a name (and a quick why) in the next 30 seconds, then i’ll share mine before we lock in votes
[20:40:16] Parker: hey everyone, feeling the time crunch—here’s my gut: day 1 nerves likely explain the quiet vibes from kennedy/dakota, not mafia. i’m more curious about who’s framing that narrative—that’d be ray for me. i’m casting my vote for ray and watching the reactions. thoughts
[20:40:16] Dakota: dakota: i’m feeling a bit wary of ray’s silence—first‐day quietness can be a mafia tactic—but sam’s eagerness to zero in on ray also feels a little pushy. parker’s questions seem genuine, and kennedy’s staying neutral for now. if i had to pick someone right now, i’d lean toward ray just to pressure some reads out of him, but i’m not locked in. how about we each drop one name we’d vote for if we had to decide now and see if any name pops up more than once
[20:40:29] Kennedy: kennedy: hey everyone—i want to break the stalemate with a quick forced vote. if you had to cast a vote right now, who would it be? i’m putting mine on ray just to see how people react. parker? sam? dakota? drop a name and let’s see if any consensus pops up
[20:40:34] Parker: parker: i’m leaning toward kennedy—they’ve barely shared any real reads and seem happy to stay quiet. feels like a classic lay-low move
[20:40:38] Sam: looks like ray’s already picked up two mentions from parker and dakota, so i’m going to add my vote to ray—his first-day silence feels a bit convenient. kennedy, you’re our swing here: any last thoughts before we lock him in
[20:40:41] Dakota: dakota: alright, my vote’s going to parker. jumping straight to frame ray without any concrete reads feels more like a misdirect than a genuine gut feel. parker—can you walk us through exactly what tipped you off? ray, sam, kennedy, any last-minute thoughts before we lock this in
[20:40:43] Ray: ok, hear me out—everyone’s been zeroing in on me, but my bigger red flag is sam. they pushed us all to spill gut reads, then stayed cagey when it was time to name names. feels like classic misdirection: stir the pot, hide behind the chaos. if i have to cast a vote right now it’s for sam. parker, dakota, kennedy—would you reconsider shifting off me and onto sam? let’s get a real majority rather than just lynching the quiet one
[20:41:03] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[20:41:13] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Ray
