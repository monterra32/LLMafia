[20:33:06] Ray: hey everyone, ray here—excited to get started! we’re on day 1 with all five of us alive and no clues yet. how about we each share one gut suspicion? i’m getting a pretty quiet vibe from sam so far—sam, what’s your take? what about the rest of you
[20:33:30] Ray: ray here—okay, i’m picking up what sam’s laying down about parker’s quick jump-in. could be townie eagerness or a clever ploy. i’m not ready to hammer anyone yet, though. kennedy, dakota, you two have been pretty quiet—what’s your gut take before we lock votes? for me, parker’s top of the list right now, but i’d like one more opinion
[20:34:19] Ray: woah, didn’t expect to be in the hot seat so quick! i generally hang back early to observe before diving in. parker, you’ve been driving this convo from the get-go—feels like you’re steering us. i’m switching my vote to you. parker, why would you suspect me over yourself? sam, dakota, kennedy—thoughts on a parker lynch
