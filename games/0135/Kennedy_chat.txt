[20:32:51] Kennedy: hey everyone! kennedy here—excited to get started. it’s early, but what are everyone’s first impressions? personally, i’d rather hold off on any snap lynches until we’ve chatted a bit, but we should probably throw out some names to see who reacts. any gut feelings on who’s acting odd so far
[20:33:11] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! day 1 vibes: ray’s radio silence is standing out to me—when we’re all under a time crunch, the mafia often sit back and gauge before jumping in. i’m also noticing parker’s kind of waiting to echo everyone else instead of staking a claim. for now i’m leaning toward ray as my primary sus, but i’m open to hearing your thoughts—sam, did anything in dakota’s quick opener strike you as off
[20:33:29] Kennedy: all right, jumping in—day 1 vibes are all about those early post timings, so here’s what i’m seeing:

• parker’s been super quick off the mark (two posts within seconds), first calling out ray and then circling back to ask me for a read. that kind of eagerness to frame someone early could be a crafty play.  
• ray’s fast, but pretty neutral—just suggesting round-robins.  
• sam’s coffee excuse seems legit for a slow start, and dakota’s just now pulling the group together.

i’m leaning toward giving parker a closer look. parker, can you walk us through why ray over, say, sam or even dakota? and dakota, do you notice anything in parker’s timing or phrasing that stands out? let’s tighten this circle before voting
[20:33:59] Kennedy: i’m with sam—if parker and i feel towny, then ray’s silence or dakota’s eagerness look off. ray, since you’ve been so quiet, what’s your gut read on any of us? dakota, what’s behind your round-robin push—just trying to be efficient, or are you fishing for reactions
[20:34:27] Kennedy: kennedy: hey folks—we’re closing in on vote time, so let’s nail this down. here’s where i’m at:

• parker’s rapid-fire switch from ray → sam feels more like deflection than a genuine read  
• sam’s coffee excuse buys you a pass, but doesn’t give us a solid town tell  

sam, can you point to the exact phrasing or timing in parker’s opener that made you sus? ray, since you jumped on sam too, what moment sold you? dakota, where are you leaning now? i’m still on parker pending a stronger case for sam, but let’s each post our top pick + one clear data point, then lock it in
