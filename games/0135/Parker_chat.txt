[20:32:50] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! day 1 always feels like a free-for-all. with only two minutes, how about a quick round-robin: who feels least “towny” so far? dakota jumped in pretty fast just now, and ray’s been awfully quiet. sam, kennedy—what are your reads? i’ll share mine once i hear yours
[20:33:10] Parker: hey everyone—parker here. i like dakota’s idea of a quick round-robin. so far it does feel like blind day one. my gut says ray jumped in awfully fast after sam’s question—could be eagerness or steering. kennedy, i’d love your first impressions since you haven’t chimed in yet. and dakota, did any of the timing or phrasing from sam or ray stand out to you as odd? just a few thoughts before we lock anything in
[20:33:35] Parker: parker: i get why sam pointed at my eagerness—i’m just naturally chatty—but day 1 finger-pointing can be a classic deflection. ray, you went from calling sam “quiet” to echoing that pretty fast—what made you land on sam so quickly? for now i’m tentatively marking sam as my top suspect, but i’m not locked in. kennedy, dakota—what are you seeing
[20:34:05] Parker: hey everyone—i get why my rapid posts look suspicious, but honestly i was just eager to get discussion rolling. if we’re reading timing and content, though, ray’s near-silence plus those generic round-robin suggestions feel like a classic soft play. i’m personally shifting my vote to ray. ray, can you give us a quick gut read on sam or dakota to help us decide? kennedy, sam, dakota—does ray’s lack of substance worry you as much as my speed
