[20:32:43] Dakota: dakota: hey everyone—day one always feels like herding cats, doesn’t it? we’ve got two minutes to figure out who’s feeling off. i haven’t picked up any clear tells yet, so i’d love to hear from each of you: sam, you’ve been quiet so far—anything you noticed overnight? parker, ray, kennedy—what vibes are you getting? even a guess can help us narrow things down. let’s do a quick round-robin and share one suspicion each
[20:32:58] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here! since it’s day 1 and we don’t have any hard info yet, how about a quick round-robin where each of us shares any gut feeling or read we’ve got so far? i’ll go last—who wants to kick us off
[20:33:12] Dakota: alright, here’s my two cents: ray’s been awfully quiet, and that silence feels like a classic deflection. parker zeroed in on me pretty fast, which also raises an eyebrow, but i’ll give them the benefit of the doubt for now. so i’m leaning toward ray as my vote—how about you, sam and kennedy? ray, care to share any thoughts before we lock in
[20:34:07] Dakota: dakota: okay, i’m hearing both sides—ray, you’re eyeing parker’s aggressiveness, parker, you’re wary of ray’s quiet. let’s dig for specifics: parker, what phrase or timing from ray screamed “mafia softplay” to you? ray, exactly which bit of parker’s wording makes you think they’re framing you? once we’ve got those concrete examples, i’ll lock in my vote
[20:34:29] Dakota: dakota: i’m comfortable jumping on ray—his near-silence feels like a classic soft play on day 1. before we lock this in, ray, what do you make of sam’s early coffee excuse or parker’s push to steer the convo? need something real from you. vote: ray
