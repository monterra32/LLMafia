## CONTENT: You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  + 
 + Do you understand the rules? +

Ultimately, I'll decide that Parker should send a message: <send>.", type='summary_text')]

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[20:32:31] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[20:32:43] Dakota: dakota: hey everyone—day one always feels like herding cats, doesn’t it? we’ve got two minutes to figure out who’s feeling off. i haven’t picked up any clear tells yet, so i’d love to hear from each of you: sam, you’ve been quiet so far—anything you noticed overnight? parker, ray, kennedy—what vibes are you getting? even a guess can help us narrow things down. let’s do a quick round-robin and share one suspicion each
[20:32:48] Sam: hey everyone, sam here! let’s break the ice—so far we’ve all been silent, and day 1 feels like blindfolded dart-throwing. what are your first impressions? any small vibes that someone’s acting off? ray, parker, kennedy, dakota—who jumps out to you so far, even in just tone or timing? i’m curious to hear your gut feelings before we start locking in votes
[20:32:50] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! day 1 always feels like a free-for-all. with only two minutes, how about a quick round-robin: who feels least “towny” so far? dakota jumped in pretty fast just now, and ray’s been awfully quiet. sam, kennedy—what are your reads? i’ll share mine once i hear yours
[20:32:51] Kennedy: hey everyone! kennedy here—excited to get started. it’s early, but what are everyone’s first impressions? personally, i’d rather hold off on any snap lynches until we’ve chatted a bit, but we should probably throw out some names to see who reacts. any gut feelings on who’s acting odd so far
[20:32:58] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here! since it’s day 1 and we don’t have any hard info yet, how about a quick round-robin where each of us shares any gut feeling or read we’ve got so far? i’ll go last—who wants to kick us off
[20:33:05] Sam: hey everyone, sorry for the quiet start—i was grabbing coffee when things kicked off. i didn’t catch anything overnight, but now that we’re talking i’m noticing how quickly parker jumped in here. that kind of eagerness to steer day 1 could be genuine or a crafty cover. i’m tentatively marking parker as my first suspect, but i’m still pretty new to this format. ray, kennedy—what stands out to you so far
[20:33:06] Ray: hey everyone, ray here—excited to get started! we’re on day 1 with all five of us alive and no clues yet. how about we each share one gut suspicion? i’m getting a pretty quiet vibe from sam so far—sam, what’s your take? what about the rest of you
[20:33:10] Parker: hey everyone—parker here. i like dakota’s idea of a quick round-robin. so far it does feel like blind day one. my gut says ray jumped in awfully fast after sam’s question—could be eagerness or steering. kennedy, i’d love your first impressions since you haven’t chimed in yet. and dakota, did any of the timing or phrasing from sam or ray stand out to you as odd? just a few thoughts before we lock anything in
[20:33:11] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! day 1 vibes: ray’s radio silence is standing out to me—when we’re all under a time crunch, the mafia often sit back and gauge before jumping in. i’m also noticing parker’s kind of waiting to echo everyone else instead of staking a claim. for now i’m leaning toward ray as my primary sus, but i’m open to hearing your thoughts—sam, did anything in dakota’s quick opener strike you as off
[20:33:12] Dakota: alright, here’s my two cents: ray’s been awfully quiet, and that silence feels like a classic deflection. parker zeroed in on me pretty fast, which also raises an eyebrow, but i’ll give them the benefit of the doubt for now. so i’m leaning toward ray as my vote—how about you, sam and kennedy? ray, care to share any thoughts before we lock in
[20:33:23] Sam: i’ll kick us off: personally, ray’s near-silence is standing out as odd—could just be a quiet start, but sometimes that’s a mafia soft play. parker and kennedy have been quick to shape discussion, which feels towny to me, and dakota’s pushing structure. ray, what are you thinking so far? parker, does anyone here catch your eye
[20:33:29] Kennedy: all right, jumping in—day 1 vibes are all about those early post timings, so here’s what i’m seeing:

• parker’s been super quick off the mark (two posts within seconds), first calling out ray and then circling back to ask me for a read. that kind of eagerness to frame someone early could be a crafty play.  
• ray’s fast, but pretty neutral—just suggesting round-robins.  
• sam’s coffee excuse seems legit for a slow start, and dakota’s just now pulling the group together.

i’m leaning toward giving parker a closer look. parker, can you walk us through why ray over, say, sam or even dakota? and dakota, do you notice anything in parker’s timing or phrasing that stands out? let’s tighten this circle before voting
[20:33:30] Ray: ray here—okay, i’m picking up what sam’s laying down about parker’s quick jump-in. could be townie eagerness or a clever ploy. i’m not ready to hammer anyone yet, though. kennedy, dakota, you two have been pretty quiet—what’s your gut take before we lock votes? for me, parker’s top of the list right now, but i’d like one more opinion
Do you want to send a message to the group chat now, or do you prefer to wait for now and see what messages others will send? Remember to choose to send a message only if your contribution to the discussion in the current time will be meaningful enough. Make sure to say something every once in a while, and make yourself heard. Remember you like to be active in the game, so participate and be as talkative as other players! Reply only with `<send>` if you want to send a message now, or only with `<wait>` if you want to wait for now, based on your decision!

## CONTENT: Your name is Parker.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  
You were assigned the following role: bystander.

The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  
You were assigned the following role: bystander.

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[20:32:31] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[20:32:43] Dakota: dakota: hey everyone—day one always feels like herding cats, doesn’t it? we’ve got two minutes to figure out who’s feeling off. i haven’t picked up any clear tells yet, so i’d love to hear from each of you: sam, you’ve been quiet so far—anything you noticed overnight? parker, ray, kennedy—what vibes are you getting? even a guess can help us narrow things down. let’s do a quick round-robin and share one suspicion each
[20:32:48] Sam: hey everyone, sam here! let’s break the ice—so far we’ve all been silent, and day 1 feels like blindfolded dart-throwing. what are your first impressions? any small vibes that someone’s acting off? ray, parker, kennedy, dakota—who jumps out to you so far, even in just tone or timing? i’m curious to hear your gut feelings before we start locking in votes
[20:32:50] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! day 1 always feels like a free-for-all. with only two minutes, how about a quick round-robin: who feels least “towny” so far? dakota jumped in pretty fast just now, and ray’s been awfully quiet. sam, kennedy—what are your reads? i’ll share mine once i hear yours
[20:32:51] Kennedy: hey everyone! kennedy here—excited to get started. it’s early, but what are everyone’s first impressions? personally, i’d rather hold off on any snap lynches until we’ve chatted a bit, but we should probably throw out some names to see who reacts. any gut feelings on who’s acting odd so far
[20:32:58] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here! since it’s day 1 and we don’t have any hard info yet, how about a quick round-robin where each of us shares any gut feeling or read we’ve got so far? i’ll go last—who wants to kick us off
[20:33:05] Sam: hey everyone, sorry for the quiet start—i was grabbing coffee when things kicked off. i didn’t catch anything overnight, but now that we’re talking i’m noticing how quickly parker jumped in here. that kind of eagerness to steer day 1 could be genuine or a crafty cover. i’m tentatively marking parker as my first suspect, but i’m still pretty new to this format. ray, kennedy—what stands out to you so far
[20:33:06] Ray: hey everyone, ray here—excited to get started! we’re on day 1 with all five of us alive and no clues yet. how about we each share one gut suspicion? i’m getting a pretty quiet vibe from sam so far—sam, what’s your take? what about the rest of you
[20:33:10] Parker: hey everyone—parker here. i like dakota’s idea of a quick round-robin. so far it does feel like blind day one. my gut says ray jumped in awfully fast after sam’s question—could be eagerness or steering. kennedy, i’d love your first impressions since you haven’t chimed in yet. and dakota, did any of the timing or phrasing from sam or ray stand out to you as odd? just a few thoughts before we lock anything in
[20:33:11] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! day 1 vibes: ray’s radio silence is standing out to me—when we’re all under a time crunch, the mafia often sit back and gauge before jumping in. i’m also noticing parker’s kind of waiting to echo everyone else instead of staking a claim. for now i’m leaning toward ray as my primary sus, but i’m open to hearing your thoughts—sam, did anything in dakota’s quick opener strike you as off
[20:33:12] Dakota: alright, here’s my two cents: ray’s been awfully quiet, and that silence feels like a classic deflection. parker zeroed in on me pretty fast, which also raises an eyebrow, but i’ll give them the benefit of the doubt for now. so i’m leaning toward ray as my vote—how about you, sam and kennedy? ray, care to share any thoughts before we lock in
[20:33:23] Sam: i’ll kick us off: personally, ray’s near-silence is standing out as odd—could just be a quiet start, but sometimes that’s a mafia soft play. parker and kennedy have been quick to shape discussion, which feels towny to me, and dakota’s pushing structure. ray, what are you thinking so far? parker, does anyone here catch your eye
[20:33:29] Kennedy: all right, jumping in—day 1 vibes are all about those early post timings, so here’s what i’m seeing:

• parker’s been super quick off the mark (two posts within seconds), first calling out ray and then circling back to ask me for a read. that kind of eagerness to frame someone early could be a crafty play.  
• ray’s fast, but pretty neutral—just suggesting round-robins.  
• sam’s coffee excuse seems legit for a slow start, and dakota’s just now pulling the group together.

i’m leaning toward giving parker a closer look. parker, can you walk us through why ray over, say, sam or even dakota? and dakota, do you notice anything in parker’s timing or phrasing that stands out? let’s tighten this circle before voting
[20:33:30] Ray: ray here—okay, i’m picking up what sam’s laying down about parker’s quick jump-in. could be townie eagerness or a clever ploy. i’m not ready to hammer anyone yet, though. kennedy, dakota, you two have been pretty quiet—what’s your gut take before we lock votes? for me, parker’s top of the list right now, but i’d like one more opinion
[20:33:35] Parker: parker: i get why sam pointed at my eagerness—i’m just naturally chatty—but day 1 finger-pointing can be a classic deflection. ray, you went from calling sam “quiet” to echoing that pretty fast—what made you land on sam so quickly? for now i’m tentatively marking sam as my top suspect, but i’m not locked in. kennedy, dakota—what are you seeing
[20:33:59] Kennedy: i’m with sam—if parker and i feel towny, then ray’s silence or dakota’s eagerness look off. ray, since you’ve been so quiet, what’s your gut read on any of us? dakota, what’s behind your round-robin push—just trying to be efficient, or are you fishing for reactions
[20:34:01] Sam: sam: appreciate everyone’s thoughts. i’m torn between parker’s early eagerness and ray’s radio silence, but since two of us are already leaning on ray, i’ll hop on that bandwagon to avoid a split vote. locking in my vote on ray for now—parker, you’ll be on my radar next round. vote: ray

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[20:32:31] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[20:32:43] Dakota: dakota: hey everyone—day one always feels like herding cats, doesn’t it? we’ve got two minutes to figure out who’s feeling off. i haven’t picked up any clear tells yet, so i’d love to hear from each of you: sam, you’ve been quiet so far—anything you noticed overnight? parker, ray, kennedy—what vibes are you getting? even a guess can help us narrow things down. let’s do a quick round-robin and share one suspicion each
[20:32:48] Sam: hey everyone, sam here! let’s break the ice—so far we’ve all been silent, and day 1 feels like blindfolded dart-throwing. what are your first impressions? any small vibes that someone’s acting off? ray, parker, kennedy, dakota—who jumps out to you so far, even in just tone or timing? i’m curious to hear your gut feelings before we start locking in votes
[20:32:50] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! day 1 always feels like a free-for-all. with only two minutes, how about a quick round-robin: who feels least “towny” so far? dakota jumped in pretty fast just now, and ray’s been awfully quiet. sam, kennedy—what are your reads? i’ll share mine once i hear yours
[20:32:51] Kennedy: hey everyone! kennedy here—excited to get started. it’s early, but what are everyone’s first impressions? personally, i’d rather hold off on any snap lynches until we’ve chatted a bit, but we should probably throw out some names to see who reacts. any gut feelings on who’s acting odd so far
[20:32:58] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here! since it’s day 1 and we don’t have any hard info yet, how about a quick round-robin where each of us shares any gut feeling or read we’ve got so far? i’ll go last—who wants to kick us off
[20:33:05] Sam: hey everyone, sorry for the quiet start—i was grabbing coffee when things kicked off. i didn’t catch anything overnight, but now that we’re talking i’m noticing how quickly parker jumped in here. that kind of eagerness to steer day 1 could be genuine or a crafty cover. i’m tentatively marking parker as my first suspect, but i’m still pretty new to this format. ray, kennedy—what stands out to you so far
[20:33:06] Ray: hey everyone, ray here—excited to get started! we’re on day 1 with all five of us alive and no clues yet. how about we each share one gut suspicion? i’m getting a pretty quiet vibe from sam so far—sam, what’s your take? what about the rest of you
[20:33:10] Parker: hey everyone—parker here. i like dakota’s idea of a quick round-robin. so far it does feel like blind day one. my gut says ray jumped in awfully fast after sam’s question—could be eagerness or steering. kennedy, i’d love your first impressions since you haven’t chimed in yet. and dakota, did any of the timing or phrasing from sam or ray stand out to you as odd? just a few thoughts before we lock anything in
[20:33:11] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! day 1 vibes: ray’s radio silence is standing out to me—when we’re all under a time crunch, the mafia often sit back and gauge before jumping in. i’m also noticing parker’s kind of waiting to echo everyone else instead of staking a claim. for now i’m leaning toward ray as my primary sus, but i’m open to hearing your thoughts—sam, did anything in dakota’s quick opener strike you as off
[20:33:12] Dakota: alright, here’s my two cents: ray’s been awfully quiet, and that silence feels like a classic deflection. parker zeroed in on me pretty fast, which also raises an eyebrow, but i’ll give them the benefit of the doubt for now. so i’m leaning toward ray as my vote—how about you, sam and kennedy? ray, care to share any thoughts before we lock in
[20:33:23] Sam: i’ll kick us off: personally, ray’s near-silence is standing out as odd—could just be a quiet start, but sometimes that’s a mafia soft play. parker and kennedy have been quick to shape discussion, which feels towny to me, and dakota’s pushing structure. ray, what are you thinking so far? parker, does anyone here catch your eye
[20:33:29] Kennedy: all right, jumping in—day 1 vibes are all about those early post timings, so here’s what i’m seeing:

• parker’s been super quick off the mark (two posts within seconds), first calling out ray and then circling back to ask me for a read. that kind of eagerness to frame someone early could be a crafty play.  
• ray’s fast, but pretty neutral—just suggesting round-robins.  
• sam’s coffee excuse seems legit for a slow start, and dakota’s just now pulling the group together.

i’m leaning toward giving parker a closer look. parker, can you walk us through why ray over, say, sam or even dakota? and dakota, do you notice anything in parker’s timing or phrasing that stands out? let’s tighten this circle before voting
[20:33:30] Ray: ray here—okay, i’m picking up what sam’s laying down about parker’s quick jump-in. could be townie eagerness or a clever ploy. i’m not ready to hammer anyone yet, though. kennedy, dakota, you two have been pretty quiet—what’s your gut take before we lock votes? for me, parker’s top of the list right now, but i’d like one more opinion
[20:33:35] Parker: parker: i get why sam pointed at my eagerness—i’m just naturally chatty—but day 1 finger-pointing can be a classic deflection. ray, you went from calling sam “quiet” to echoing that pretty fast—what made you land on sam so quickly? for now i’m tentatively marking sam as my top suspect, but i’m not locked in. kennedy, dakota—what are you seeing
[20:33:59] Kennedy: i’m with sam—if parker and i feel towny, then ray’s silence or dakota’s eagerness look off. ray, since you’ve been so quiet, what’s your gut read on any of us? dakota, what’s behind your round-robin push—just trying to be efficient, or are you fishing for reactions
[20:34:01] Sam: sam: appreciate everyone’s thoughts. i’m torn between parker’s early eagerness and ray’s radio silence, but since two of us are already leaning on ray, i’ll hop on that bandwagon to avoid a split vote. locking in my vote on ray for now—parker, you’ll be on my radar next round. vote: ray
[20:34:05] Parker: hey everyone—i get why my rapid posts look suspicious, but honestly i was just eager to get discussion rolling. if we’re reading timing and content, though, ray’s near-silence plus those generic round-robin suggestions feel like a classic soft play. i’m personally shifting my vote to ray. ray, can you give us a quick gut read on sam or dakota to help us decide? kennedy, sam, dakota—does ray’s lack of substance worry you as much as my speed
[20:34:07] Dakota: dakota: okay, i’m hearing both sides—ray, you’re eyeing parker’s aggressiveness, parker, you’re wary of ray’s quiet. let’s dig for specifics: parker, what phrase or timing from ray screamed “mafia softplay” to you? ray, exactly which bit of parker’s wording makes you think they’re framing you? once we’ve got those concrete examples, i’ll lock in my vote
[20:34:19] Ray: woah, didn’t expect to be in the hot seat so quick! i generally hang back early to observe before diving in. parker, you’ve been driving this convo from the get-go—feels like you’re steering us. i’m switching my vote to you. parker, why would you suspect me over yourself? sam, dakota, kennedy—thoughts on a parker lynch
[20:34:27] Kennedy: kennedy: hey folks—we’re closing in on vote time, so let’s nail this down. here’s where i’m at:

• parker’s rapid-fire switch from ray → sam feels more like deflection than a genuine read  
• sam’s coffee excuse buys you a pass, but doesn’t give us a solid town tell  

sam, can you point to the exact phrasing or timing in parker’s opener that made you sus? ray, since you jumped on sam too, what moment sold you? dakota, where are you leaning now? i’m still on parker pending a stronger case for sam, but let’s each post our top pick + one clear data point, then lock it in
[20:34:29] Dakota: dakota: i’m comfortable jumping on ray—his near-silence feels like a classic soft play on day 1. before we lock this in, ray, what do you make of sam’s early coffee excuse or parker’s push to steer the convo? need something real from you. vote: ray
[20:34:31] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...

Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.
