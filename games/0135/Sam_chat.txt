[20:32:48] Sam: hey everyone, sam here! let’s break the ice—so far we’ve all been silent, and day 1 feels like blindfolded dart-throwing. what are your first impressions? any small vibes that someone’s acting off? ray, parker, kennedy, dakota—who jumps out to you so far, even in just tone or timing? i’m curious to hear your gut feelings before we start locking in votes
[20:33:05] Sam: hey everyone, sorry for the quiet start—i was grabbing coffee when things kicked off. i didn’t catch anything overnight, but now that we’re talking i’m noticing how quickly parker jumped in here. that kind of eagerness to steer day 1 could be genuine or a crafty cover. i’m tentatively marking parker as my first suspect, but i’m still pretty new to this format. ray, kennedy—what stands out to you so far
[20:33:23] Sam: i’ll kick us off: personally, ray’s near-silence is standing out as odd—could just be a quiet start, but sometimes that’s a mafia soft play. parker and kennedy have been quick to shape discussion, which feels towny to me, and dakota’s pushing structure. ray, what are you thinking so far? parker, does anyone here catch your eye
[20:34:01] Sam: sam: appreciate everyone’s thoughts. i’m torn between parker’s early eagerness and ray’s radio silence, but since two of us are already leaning on ray, i’ll hop on that bandwagon to avoid a split vote. locking in my vote on ray for now—parker, you’ll be on my radar next round. vote: ray
