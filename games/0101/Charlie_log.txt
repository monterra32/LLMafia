## CONTENT: You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  +

## CONTENT: Your name is Charlie.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  
You were assigned the following role: mafia. 
The game's chat room was open at [16:28:12].

[16:28:29] Parker: hey sam, hey charlie! day 1’s just heating up and we haven’t seen much action yet. how about a quick round-robin of gut feelings—any initial impressions on who might be acting off? i’ll keep my mind open based on what you share
[16:28:12] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 1.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.

Do you want to send a message to the group chat now, or do you prefer to wait for now and see what messages others will send? Remember to choose to send a message only if your contribution to the discussion in the current time will be meaningful enough. Make sure to say something every once in a while, and make yourself heard. Remember you like to be active in the game, so participate and be as talkative as other players! Reply only with `<send>` if you want to send a message now, or only with `<wait>` if you want to wait for now, based on your decision!

Alternatively, I could mention how I'm wary of the quieter players. Producing this final message feels essential!", type='summary_text')]

## CONTENT: I think we need to lock in a vote soon. Parker, you’ve basically sat on the fence with no real reads—whereas Sam at least gave a clear (if quick) rationale. I’m not convinced by silence as “playing it safe,” so I’m casting my vote for Parker. Sam, you on board?

[16:28:25] Sam: morning everyone! we’ve got a quick window here, so let’s share any first impressions. parker, charlie—any gut feelings on who seems sketchy so far? i don’t have a strong read yet, so i’m curious what you’re both thinking before we start casting votes
[16:28:29] Parker: hey sam, hey charlie! day 1’s just heating up and we haven’t seen much action yet. how about a quick round-robin of gut feelings—any initial impressions on who might be acting off? i’ll keep my mind open based on what you share
[16:28:12] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 1.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[16:28:35] Charlie: hey sam, parker—charlie here! excited to get started. it’s pretty quiet so far… any initial impressions or gut reads? parker, want to kick us off with what you’re thinking? sam, i’m curious about your take too
[16:28:54] Parker: morning sam, charlie! i don’t have a rock-solid read yet. charlie, you’ve been pretty quiet—could be nerves or laying low. sam, i like that you jumped in quickly, but it also feels a bit eager. i’m going to hold off casting a hard vote until we see someone slip up. what about you two—what would tip you toward voting someone today
[16:28:56] Sam: hey everyone, sam here. day 1 is short, so let’s get a quick read. charlie, parker—what are your gut feelings? i’m not ready to vote solely on vibes, so i’d love to hear some rationale. right now i’m leaning slightly toward parker since they’ve been pretty quiet, but i’m open—over to you both
[16:29:00] Charlie: hey sam, parker—tough to go on much so early. sam’s energy feels genuine, but parker’s been awfully measured and hasn’t thrown out any concrete hunches. that could just be cautious play or an attempt to fly under the radar. my faint lean is toward parker. what are you both thinking
[16:29:12] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...

## CONTENT: Your name is Charlie.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  
You were assigned the following role: mafia. 
The game's chat room was open at [16:28:12].
