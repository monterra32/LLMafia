[16:28:29] Parker: hey sam, hey charlie! day 1’s just heating up and we haven’t seen much action yet. how about a quick round-robin of gut feelings—any initial impressions on who might be acting off? i’ll keep my mind open based on what you share
[16:28:54] Parker: morning sam, charlie! i don’t have a rock-solid read yet. charlie, you’ve been pretty quiet—could be nerves or laying low. sam, i like that you jumped in quickly, but it also feels a bit eager. i’m going to hold off casting a hard vote until we see someone slip up. what about you two—what would tip you toward voting someone today
