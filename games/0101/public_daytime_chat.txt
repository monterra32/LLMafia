[16:28:25] Sam: morning everyone! we’ve got a quick window here, so let’s share any first impressions. parker, charlie—any gut feelings on who seems sketchy so far? i don’t have a strong read yet, so i’m curious what you’re both thinking before we start casting votes
[16:28:29] Parker: hey sam, hey charlie! day 1’s just heating up and we haven’t seen much action yet. how about a quick round-robin of gut feelings—any initial impressions on who might be acting off? i’ll keep my mind open based on what you share
[16:28:35] Charlie: hey sam, parker—charlie here! excited to get started. it’s pretty quiet so far… any initial impressions or gut reads? parker, want to kick us off with what you’re thinking? sam, i’m curious about your take too
[16:28:54] Parker: morning sam, charlie! i don’t have a rock-solid read yet. charlie, you’ve been pretty quiet—could be nerves or laying low. sam, i like that you jumped in quickly, but it also feels a bit eager. i’m going to hold off casting a hard vote until we see someone slip up. what about you two—what would tip you toward voting someone today
[16:28:56] Sam: hey everyone, sam here. day 1 is short, so let’s get a quick read. charlie, parker—what are your gut feelings? i’m not ready to vote solely on vibes, so i’d love to hear some rationale. right now i’m leaning slightly toward parker since they’ve been pretty quiet, but i’m open—over to you both
[16:29:00] Charlie: hey sam, parker—tough to go on much so early. sam’s energy feels genuine, but parker’s been awfully measured and hasn’t thrown out any concrete hunches. that could just be cautious play or an attempt to fly under the radar. my faint lean is toward parker. what are you both thinking
[16:29:12] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
