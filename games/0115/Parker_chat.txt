[16:34:25] Parker: hey everyone, parker here. with just two minutes this round, how about we each drop a quick gut‐check instead of jumping straight to votes? let’s save voting for the last 30 seconds so we actually have time to chat. who wants to share a suspicion or read first? sam, you game
[16:34:47] Parker: hey all, parker here—sorry for the early radio silence. i’ve been mulling things over, and kennedy calling me out for being quiet feels like an early spotlight move—could be projection rather than genuine concern. sam’s eagerness is great for morale but maybe a touch over-zealous for day 1? for now i’m tentatively marking kennedy as my top sus. ray, dakota—what are you both picking up on
[16:34:57] Parker: hey everyone, i get why my quietness is drawing heat—i’m more of an observer than a chatterbox. but let’s not lock in on me just yet. i’m curious about sam’s and kennedy’s reads: sam, you jumped to me first—what made me stand out over someone else? kennedy, you’ve been quick to redirect questions—what are you picking up? ray, dakota—between sam’s eagerness and kennedy’s deflect-y style, who’s giving you more mafia vibes and why? let’s get a few more takes before we lock in votes
[16:35:17] Parker: hey everyone, thanks for all the takes. i get why my quietness stands out, but honestly i’m more concerned about sam’s near-instant replay of the same message—feels like chat-padding to dominate the convo—and kennedy’s eagerness to zero in on me feels like projection. ray, you’ve been calm and analytical so far—what’s your gut now that we’ve all spoken? dakota, how do sam’s double-posts and kennedy’s spotlight move land with you? i’m shifting my top sus to sam, kennedy as a close second. let’s hear final reads before we lock in votes
[16:35:35] Parker: hey everyone—i get the concerns about my quiet start, but honestly what jumps out more to me is sam’s near-instant eagerness (even reposting the same point) and kennedy’s quick deflection every time they’re challenged. that feels more orchestrated than my laid-back style. sam—can you explain why my silence reads as more suspicious than someone else’s behavior? and kennedy—what in my phrasing convinced you i’m mafia rather than just a quiet bystander? ray, dakota—after hearing that, who sticks out to you two as the clearer sus pick? let’s nail down one person before we lock in votes
