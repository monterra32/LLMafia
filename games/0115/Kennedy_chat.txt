[16:34:19] Kennedy: hey everyone! day 1 always starts slow. i haven’t locked onto anyone yet, but i did notice parker’s been pretty quiet—and quiet can sometimes be a tactic. what are your first impressions? ray, what’s your gut feeling? sam? dakota
[16:34:33] Kennedy: hey sam—great kickoff! i’m with you on looking for odd vibes. so far:

• parker’s been totally quiet—could be laying low, or maybe they’re slipping under the radar?  
• ray asked a solid question but then went silent again—analytical or just defaulting to watch-and-wait?  
• dakota, you’ve been pretty chill so far—anything you’re picking up on?

for me, the “too eager” vibe could swing both ways: genuine bystander trying to help, or mafia planting goodwill. what’s everyone’s gut check on who seems most likely to be hiding something?
[16:34:51] Kennedy: i’ll throw out my gut-check: i’m feeling parker as my top sus—really quiet so far, and quiet can be a tactic to avoid attention. my second lean is sam, since they basically reposted the same message twice—could be padding the chat to steer things. ray, dakota—what are your current top sus picks
[16:35:07] Kennedy: hey parker—no worries on the early quiet, but i did want to test reactions, not point a target. you’ve jumped on me as top sus pretty fast, though—can you share what exactly in my tone or phrasing feels mafia-like? you went from silence to a sus vote in one turn, so i’m curious about your read.  

ray, dakota—what do you make of parker’s sudden flip? and sam, do you get any similar vibes here? let’s try to get some concrete reads before we start locking in votes
[16:35:54] Kennedy: i get why my redirections might’ve looked deflect-y—my goal was just to pull in everyone’s reads, not dodge scrutiny. that said, sam’s near-instant double-post really stood out to me—could be eager bystander energy, or classic chat-padding to steer things. 

ray, parker: do you see that repetition as harmless enthusiasm or something more? sam, can you explain the copy-paste? with time running out, if there’s no clear defense i’m leaning toward voting sam. thoughts?
