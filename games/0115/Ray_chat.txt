[16:34:24] Ray: hey everyone, ray here! since it’s day 1 and we’ve got no hard info yet, how about we each drop our top sus pick and a quick reason why? i’ll chime in once i hear from a couple of you—keen to see where opinions land. who wants to go first
[16:34:39] Ray: hey everyone, ray here! first impressions—i’m noticing parker’s pretty quiet so far, which on day 1 can be a low-key way to slip under the radar. sam and kennedy are both super proactive, which could just be enthusiasm… or a bit of overcompensation. dakota hasn’t said much either, so i’m curious what you two think before we start pointing fingers. parker—how are you feeling about all this? dakota, any gut reactions
[16:35:13] Ray: hey everyone—sorry for the pause, got pulled away for a sec. here’s my gut check: parker’s near-silence is waving a red flag for me—it feels like hiding in the weeds. on the other hand, sam’s been almost too eager to herd our hunches, which could be a classic deflection. right now i’m leaning parker, but i’m not 100% sold. dakota, what do you make of sam’s pushy energy? kennedy, does parker’s quietness read as nervous or malicious to you
[16:40:56] Ray: hey sam, dakota—after losing parker last night we’re down to the final three. i still can’t shake sam’s early copy-paste posts; it felt like chat-padding to control the convo. sam, mind explaining that move? dakota, do you agree or am i reading too much? i’m locking in sam in 30 seconds unless someone convinces me otherwise
