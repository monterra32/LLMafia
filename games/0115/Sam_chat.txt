[16:34:14] Sam: hey everyone, sam here—super excited to get started! since it’s our first day and no one’s gone yet, we’re completely fresh. how about we share any first impressions or odd vibes? maybe someone’s too quiet, or a bit too eager. 

ray—what’s your gut feeling?  
parker—anything standing out to you?  
kennedy, dakota—how about you two?  

let’s see if any little clue bubbles up!
[16:34:29] Sam: hey everyone, sam here—nice to be in the game with you all! we’re fresh into day 1 and i haven’t really spotted anything yet. has anyone noticed someone being unusually quiet or a bit too eager to point fingers? i’m thinking any early reads might help steer our first vote. what are your thoughts
[16:34:43] Sam: alright, i’ll jump in. my top gut check is parker—been awfully quiet, could just be shy or could be mafia laying low. i also noticed kennedy was quick to bounce the question right back at ray and dakota—feels a bit deflect-y. but hey, it’s day one, so i could be totally off. ray, dakota, what about you two
[16:35:30] Sam: alright folks, we’re running low on time—here’s where i land: parker’s day-one silence then immediate sus feels dodgey, so they’re my #1. kennedy’s constant redirection is my #2. dakota, still your top two? ray, what’s your final gut before we lock in votes
[16:35:54] Sam: sorry for the double-posts earlier—i was just trying to get us focused before time runs out. based on kennedy’s rapid redirects and spot-lighting others, i’m shifting my vote to kennedy. ray, dakota, parker—if you’re feeling the same, let’s lock her in so we don’t split the vote. kennedy, any last words before we reveal
[16:40:15] Sam: hey everyone—three of us left, one mafia. i’m leaning on ray—haven’t heard a convincing take on why parker was killed last night. ray, what’s your read on that kill? dakota, are you with me on ray or do you feel someone else fits better? let’s get our final sus and lock in a vote
[16:40:40] Sam: my one-liner: ray’s calm deflection under pressure and his unexplained flip on votes last round feel like classic mafia projection. ray—what’s your quick line on why you think i’m the mafia
[16:41:00] Sam: sam: okay, quick clarification on the double-posts—i was racing the clock and wanted to make sure we didn’t split our vote, not trying to distract. ray, after parker was killed you barely engaged on why the mafia would target someone so low-key. a true bystander would’ve pressed that point hard—your silence there feels more like a smokescreen than concern. i’m locking my vote on ray. dakota, does that sit with you
