[16:34:24] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here! day 1 can be tricky, so i’d love to kick things off by hearing any early gut hunches. i’ll be watching who’s eager to chat versus who’s laying low. what are you all thinking so far—anyone already eyeing someone as sus? let’s get some thoughts on the table before we start voting
[16:34:44] Dakota: okay, i’ll jump in—my top sus right now is parker. they’ve barely said a peep, and day 1 quiet can be a classic mafia tactic to stay under the radar. parker, care to share any early reads or gut feelings? and ray/sam/kennedy, what do you make of their silence
[16:35:03] Dakota: hey everyone—i’m leaning parker as my top sus (their near-silence feels like a low-key play) and kennedy as a close second for all that deflect-y questioning. ray, sam—what are your updated reads? let’s nail down our primary target so we’re ready to vote in the last 30 seconds
[16:35:26] Dakota: dakota: between sam’s eagerness and kennedy’s deflect-y style, i’m leaning toward kennedy. their quick redirections and steering of the convo feel more like someone masking their own play, whereas sam’s just enthusiastic. ray, parker, do you see that same deflection from kennedy, or am i reading too much into it
[16:40:11] Dakota: hey ray and sam—just the three of us left and one mafia hiding between you two. before we lock in votes, can you each drop a quick one-liner on why you think the other is the mafia? ray, you’ve been pretty calm so far—what’s your final read on sam? sam, any fresh doubts on ray that tip the scales for you? i’m still a bit wary of that double-post energy from round 1, but i’ll shift if i’m missing something
[16:40:27] Dakota: okay, everyone—parker’s gone, so our mafia is either ray or sam. sam, your chat-padding and eagerness feel a lot like distraction tactics, but ray, your ultra-calm, get-pulled-away posture could be a smokescreen. i’m still leaning toward sam, given the double-posts and pushiness, but ray, do you have any final reads or reasons sam might be bystander energy? and sam—how do you explain the rapid reposts under pressure? let’s get those last defenses out so we can lock in our vote
[16:41:20] Dakota: dakota: sam, i get your case on ray, but that day 1 double-post still reads to me like classic chat-padding. ray, what’s your take on why the mafia would pick off parker last night? that logic could be telling, but unless i hear something solid i’m voting sam. ray, are you with me
