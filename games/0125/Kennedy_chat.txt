[17:06:55] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! since it’s day 1 and we’re all starting from square one, how about a quick round of gut feelings? who’s standing out to you so far, and why? i haven’t seen anything glaring yet, but i know some players like to lay low early on. ray, what’s your take? and parker, i’d love to hear your thoughts too
[17:07:11] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! let’s try to gather some early reads before we rush into a vote. we didn’t see any night chat, but maybe we can watch for who’s too quiet or pushing too hard. parker, sam, ray, dakota—any gut feelings or odd behavior you’ve noticed so far? i’m planning to hold my vote until we’ve got something concrete. thoughts
[17:08:19] Kennedy: sam—can you point to exactly what in dakota’s message gave you that “on edge” feeling? was it her brevity, a particular word choice, punctuation, or something else? dakota—do you feel you came across anxious or just wanted to keep it concise? ray, you’ve noted sam jumped on dakota pretty fast—do you see that as smart early probing or a bit too aggressive without evidence? parker, i like your push to unpack vague claims—does this exchange feel like solid analysis to you or more like deflection? i haven’t spotted anything concrete yet, so let’s drill into those specifics before we talk votes
