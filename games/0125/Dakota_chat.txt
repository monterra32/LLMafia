[17:07:02] Dakota: hey everyone! dakota here. day 1 can be tricky, so how about a quick go-around—each of us shares one gut feeling or tiny observation from overnight (even if it’s “nothing”). i’ll kick us off: i didn’t notice a thing on my end. ray? parker? sam? kennedy? over to you
[17:07:48] Dakota: hey all, for what it’s worth the only real twinge i got was sam jumping on me being “on edge.” could be day-one nerves, but pointing fingers that fast feels a bit off. parker, you said you’re watching interactions—what’s your gut on sam’s move? ray, any specific reason you’re undecided, or something you’d need to see before voting? i’m happy to hang back until we get a bit more meat on the bones
[17:08:20] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here. sorry if i seemed jittery earlier—just day-one jitters. i haven’t picked up any strong tells: kennedy’s mirroring phrasing might just be habit; sam’s friendly vibe could be genuine or cover; and parker’s flag on passive vs over-eager behavior covers all of us (including me). ray, have you noticed any micro-reads in sam’s or parker’s wording or pace? personally i’d wait a bit longer for someone to slip before casting a vote. what do you all think
[17:12:09] Dakota: hey everyone—ray, when you say i’ve been “brief and jittery,” can you point to the exact snippet that struck you? right now it feels like a label without any backing. parker, you’ve been our go-to for grounded analysis—what’s your read here? do you see anything in my posts that screams mafia, or are you leaning toward ray? i’d rather lynch someone with concrete quotes than guess. unless we get something solid, i’m inclined to flip my vote onto ray—thoughts
