[17:07:23] Ray: hey everyone, ray here. day 1 is always tricky and i’d hate to waste our lynch on an innocent. how about we each share a quick gut reaction on who feels most suspicious—even if that’s “no one yet”? i’ll go first: i’m honestly undecided and nobody’s jumped out at me so far, so i’m holding off on casting a vote. who wants to share their take
[17:07:49] Ray: hey everyone, ray here! no solid reads yet, but two things caught my eye: parker hasn’t offered any real thoughts (could be flying under the radar) and sam jumped on dakota early without giving specifics. i’m going to hold my vote until we get more concrete reasons—sam or parker, want to elaborate on your gut feelings
[17:08:13] Ray: i hear you, dakota—nothing’s clicked for me yet either. to get us moving, i’m going to tentatively keep an eye on sam: jumping on dakota for “being on edge” feels a bit premature for day 1. not a vote yet, just a note. sam, what made you zero in on dakota so quickly? parker or kennedy—does that feel off to you, too
[17:08:42] Ray: ray: i’ll play along—my “green light” goes to parker. she’s been methodical in asking for specifics and hasn’t tried to steer us without evidence, which feels like classic bystander logic. over to kennedy and dakota—who gets your trust check and why
[17:10:44] Ray: hey everyone—time’s ticking and we need to lock something in. i’ve been watching how we’ve all been interacting, and right now parker’s the one actually grounding their points with quotes and follow-ups. dakota’s been a bit brief and jittery, and i haven’t seen anything concrete from those posts. i’m going to cast my vote for dakota unless someone can give me a solid reason not to. parker—what do you think? dakota, anything you want to clarify before we move on
