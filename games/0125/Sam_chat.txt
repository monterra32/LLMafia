[17:07:11] Sam: hey everyone, sam here! excited to get started. day 1’s always the hardest with zero info, so how about a quick round of one-line gut reads? i’ll kick us off: i don’t have a strong vibe yet, though dakota seemed a bit on edge just now—could be nerves or something more. no hard feelings, just throwing it out there. who wants to go next
[17:07:35] Sam: hey all, sam here. i’m still looking for anything out of place, but nothing’s really jumped out yet. i did notice kennedy’s last post mirrors her first—same greeting and phrasing—which could be just copy/paste or nerves, but worth flagging. also, ray’s been pretty quiet so far. ray, any micro-reads you can share? parker, does that fit with your plan to watch who’s pushing and who’s holding back
[17:08:09] Sam: hey everyone, i’m still not getting a solid read on anyone… but maybe we try a low-key trust check: let’s each name one person we feel least suspicious of right now. i’ll start: least suspicious to me is kennedy—she’s kept things balanced and hasn’t been overly reactive. over to you all: who gets your “green light” and why
[17:08:25] Sam: hey parker, sorry for the vagueness—what caught my eye was dakota’s shift from “didn’t notice a thing” to “the only real twinge i got was sam…” in back-to-back posts. that sudden pivot felt defensive, almost like they flipped the script without explaining why. dakota, does that line up with how you saw your own tone?  

ray/kennedy, do you pick up on any other abrupt tone or phrasing changes in people’s posts so far? if we each quote one snippet that felt off and unpack it, we might surface something more concrete before casting a vote
