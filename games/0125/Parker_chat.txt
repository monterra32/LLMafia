[17:07:00] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! excited to get rolling on day 1. since we haven’t got any hard info yet, i’m planning to watch how people interact—who’s championing a suspect and who’s staying quiet. personally i don’t have any strong reads so far, so i’m curious: what’s everyone’s gut feeling at this point
[17:07:28] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! i’m with kennedy—no glaring tells yet. ray, you’ve been pretty quiet, which could be cautious or just flying under the radar. dakota’s silence feels the same. sam’s super agreeable, which is nice…but could also be a cover. personally, i’m going to watch who hangs back vs. who tries to steer us. right now no one’s jumping out as obviously shady, but i’m flagging any overly passive or over-eager behavior. how about we each share one quick gut feeling to get a baseline? i’ll go first if you’d like
[17:07:50] Parker: hey, since we’re all hovering at “no strong reads” so far, i’d like to dig into sam’s callout of dakota being “on edge.”  

sam—can you give a concrete example of what felt off about dakota’s tone or phrasing?  
dakota—does sam’s impression line up with how you feel you came across just now?  

ray, kennedy—what are your thoughts on that exchange? i find that getting people to unpack a vague gut feeling can reveal more than the feeling itself. if we can’t pin anyone with real behaviors, we risk lynching someone innocent on a hunch. let’s see if these questions spark anything more solid
[17:08:18] Parker: hey everyone—i’m still sitting on my vote, but want to dig into specifics before we lynch anyone. sam, you flagged dakota as “on edge” really quickly—could you quote the exact phrase that tipped you off? and kennedy, you’ve used almost identical greetings twice now—what in particular felt copy/paste to you, sam? ray and dakota, what kind of concrete example would you need to commit your vote? right now i’m most curious about sam’s rapid finger on the trigger, but i’d feel better if we each backed our gut reads with actual text snippets. let’s get those on the table
[17:08:40] Parker: ray—i’m with you. sam’s quick “on edge” call feels premature without details. sam, could you point to exactly what wording or tone in dakota’s message set off alarm bells? dakota, did you notice yourself typing differently or was it just nerves? 

and jumping back to sam’s trust check, my “green light” goes to kennedy—she’s asked follow-ups and grounded her points so far. kennedy, who do you feel least suspicious of right now and why?
[17:10:59] Parker: hey ray, dakota—sad to lose kennedy. now on day 2, let’s each drop one micro-read: quote a snippet from yesterday’s chat that still bugs you and tell us why. i’ll start: when dakota went from “didn’t notice a thing” to “the only real twinge” in back-to-back lines, it felt like a knee-jerk pivot without explanation. ray, how are you reading that? dakota, what snippet from mine or ray’s posts raised a red flag for you? let’s unpack these before voting
[17:11:19] Parker: i’m with ray—unless dakota can point to something concrete beyond “jittery,” i don’t see any real defense here. dakota, can you quote a specific line from my or ray’s posts that you think is misleading or explain exactly what in your own wording was misread? if not, i’m locking in my vote for you. anyone else have a last-minute read
