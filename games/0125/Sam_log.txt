Do you want to send a message to the group chat now, or do you prefer to wait for now and see what messages others will send? Remember to choose to send a message only if your contribution to the discussion in the current time will be meaningful enough. Make sure to say something every once in a while, and make yourself heard. Remember you like to be active in the game, so participate and be as talkative as other players! Reply only with `<send>` if you want to send a message now, or only with `<wait>` if you want to wait for now, based on your decision!

[17:07:28] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! i’m with kennedy—no glaring tells yet. ray, you’ve been pretty quiet, which could be cautious or just flying under the radar. dakota’s silence feels the same. sam’s super agreeable, which is nice…but could also be a cover. personally, i’m going to watch who hangs back vs. who tries to steer us. right now no one’s jumping out as obviously shady, but i’m flagging any overly passive or over-eager behavior. how about we each share one quick gut feeling to get a baseline? i’ll go first if you’d like

The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  
You were assigned the following role: bystander.

[17:06:55] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! since it’s day 1 and we’re all starting from square one, how about a quick round of gut feelings? who’s standing out to you so far, and why? i haven’t seen anything glaring yet, but i know some players like to lay low early on. ray, what’s your take? and parker, i’d love to hear your thoughts too
[17:07:00] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! excited to get rolling on day 1. since we haven’t got any hard info yet, i’m planning to watch how people interact—who’s championing a suspect and who’s staying quiet. personally i don’t have any strong reads so far, so i’m curious: what’s everyone’s gut feeling at this point
[17:07:02] Dakota: hey everyone! dakota here. day 1 can be tricky, so how about a quick go-around—each of us shares one gut feeling or tiny observation from overnight (even if it’s “nothing”). i’ll kick us off: i didn’t notice a thing on my end. ray? parker? sam? kennedy? over to you
[17:07:11] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! let’s try to gather some early reads before we rush into a vote. we didn’t see any night chat, but maybe we can watch for who’s too quiet or pushing too hard. parker, sam, ray, dakota—any gut feelings or odd behavior you’ve noticed so far? i’m planning to hold my vote until we’ve got something concrete. thoughts

[17:07:35] Sam: hey all, sam here. i’m still looking for anything out of place, but nothing’s really jumped out yet. i did notice kennedy’s last post mirrors her first—same greeting and phrasing—which could be just copy/paste or nerves, but worth flagging. also, ray’s been pretty quiet so far. ray, any micro-reads you can share? parker, does that fit with your plan to watch who’s pushing and who’s holding back
[17:07:48] Dakota: hey all, for what it’s worth the only real twinge i got was sam jumping on me being “on edge.” could be day-one nerves, but pointing fingers that fast feels a bit off. parker, you said you’re watching interactions—what’s your gut on sam’s move? ray, any specific reason you’re undecided, or something you’d need to see before voting? i’m happy to hang back until we get a bit more meat on the bones
[17:07:49] Ray: hey everyone, ray here! no solid reads yet, but two things caught my eye: parker hasn’t offered any real thoughts (could be flying under the radar) and sam jumped on dakota early without giving specifics. i’m going to hold my vote until we get more concrete reasons—sam or parker, want to elaborate on your gut feelings
[17:07:50] Parker: hey, since we’re all hovering at “no strong reads” so far, i’d like to dig into sam’s callout of dakota being “on edge.”  

sam—can you give a concrete example of what felt off about dakota’s tone or phrasing?  
dakota—does sam’s impression line up with how you feel you came across just now?  

ray, kennedy—what are your thoughts on that exchange? i find that getting people to unpack a vague gut feeling can reveal more than the feeling itself. if we can’t pin anyone with real behaviors, we risk lynching someone innocent on a hunch. let’s see if these questions spark anything more solid
Do you want to send a message to the group chat now, or do you prefer to wait for now and see what messages others will send? Remember to choose to send a message only if your contribution to the discussion in the current time will be meaningful enough. Make sure to say something every once in a while, and make yourself heard. Remember you like to be active in the game, so participate and be as talkative as other players!

[17:07:35] Sam: hey all, sam here. i’m still looking for anything out of place, but nothing’s really jumped out yet. i did notice kennedy’s last post mirrors her first—same greeting and phrasing—which could be just copy/paste or nerves, but worth flagging. also, ray’s been pretty quiet so far. ray, any micro-reads you can share? parker, does that fit with your plan to watch who’s pushing and who’s holding back
[17:07:48] Dakota: hey all, for what it’s worth the only real twinge i got was sam jumping on me being “on edge.” could be day-one nerves, but pointing fingers that fast feels a bit off. parker, you said you’re watching interactions—what’s your gut on sam’s move? ray, any specific reason you’re undecided, or something you’d need to see before voting? i’m happy to hang back until we get a bit more meat on the bones
[17:07:49] Ray: hey everyone, ray here! no solid reads yet, but two things caught my eye: parker hasn’t offered any real thoughts (could be flying under the radar) and sam jumped on dakota early without giving specifics. i’m going to hold my vote until we get more concrete reasons—sam or parker, want to elaborate on your gut feelings
[17:07:50] Parker: hey, since we’re all hovering at “no strong reads” so far, i’d like to dig into sam’s callout of dakota being “on edge.”  

sam—can you give a concrete example of what felt off about dakota’s tone or phrasing?  
dakota—does sam’s impression line up with how you feel you came across just now?  

ray, kennedy—what are your thoughts on that exchange? i find that getting people to unpack a vague gut feeling can reveal more than the feeling itself. if we can’t pin anyone with real behaviors, we risk lynching someone innocent on a hunch. let’s see if these questions spark anything more solid

The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  
You were assigned the following role: bystander.

[17:06:55] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! since it’s day 1 and we’re all starting from square one, how about a quick round of gut feelings? who’s standing out to you so far, and why? i haven’t seen anything glaring yet, but i know some players like to lay low early on. ray, what’s your take? and parker, i’d love to hear your thoughts too
[17:07:00] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! excited to get rolling on day 1. since we haven’t got any hard info yet, i’m planning to watch how people interact—who’s championing a suspect and who’s staying quiet. personally i don’t have any strong reads so far, so i’m curious: what’s everyone’s gut feeling at this point
[17:07:02] Dakota: hey everyone! dakota here. day 1 can be tricky, so how about a quick go-around—each of us shares one gut feeling or tiny observation from overnight (even if it’s “nothing”). i’ll kick us off: i didn’t notice a thing on my end. ray? parker? sam? kennedy? over to you
[17:07:11] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! let’s try to gather some early reads before we rush into a vote. we didn’t see any night chat, but maybe we can watch for who’s too quiet or pushing too hard. parker, sam, ray, dakota—any gut feelings or odd behavior you’ve noticed so far? i’m planning to hold my vote until we’ve got something concrete. thoughts
[17:06:45] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:07:11] Sam: hey everyone, sam here! excited to get started. day 1’s always the hardest with zero info, so how about a quick round of one-line gut reads? i’ll kick us off: i don’t have a strong vibe yet, though dakota seemed a bit on edge just now—could be nerves or something more. no hard feelings, just throwing it out there. who wants to go next
[17:07:23] Ray: hey everyone, ray here. day 1 is always tricky and i’d hate to waste our lynch on an innocent. how about we each share a quick gut reaction on who feels most suspicious—even if that’s “no one yet”? i’ll go first: i’m honestly undecided and nobody’s jumped out at me so far, so i’m holding off on casting a vote. who wants to share their take

[17:08:13] Ray: i hear you, dakota—nothing’s clicked for me yet either. to get us moving, i’m going to tentatively keep an eye on sam: jumping on dakota for “being on edge” feels a bit premature for day 1. not a vote yet, just a note. sam, what made you zero in on dakota so quickly? parker or kennedy—does that feel off to you, too
[17:08:18] Parker: hey everyone—i’m still sitting on my vote, but want to dig into specifics before we lynch anyone. sam, you flagged dakota as “on edge” really quickly—could you quote the exact phrase that tipped you off? and kennedy, you’ve used almost identical greetings twice now—what in particular felt copy/paste to you, sam? ray and dakota, what kind of concrete example would you need to commit your vote? right now i’m most curious about sam’s rapid finger on the trigger, but i’d feel better if we each backed our gut reads with actual text snippets. let’s get those on the table
[17:08:19] Kennedy: sam—can you point to exactly what in dakota’s message gave you that “on edge” feeling? was it her brevity, a particular word choice, punctuation, or something else? dakota—do you feel you came across anxious or just wanted to keep it concise? ray, you’ve noted sam jumped on dakota pretty fast—do you see that as smart early probing or a bit too aggressive without evidence? parker, i like your push to unpack vague claims—does this exchange feel like solid analysis to you or more like deflection? i haven’t spotted anything concrete yet, so let’s drill into those specifics before we talk votes
[17:08:20] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here. sorry if i seemed jittery earlier—just day-one jitters. i haven’t picked up any strong tells: kennedy’s mirroring phrasing might just be habit; sam’s friendly vibe could be genuine or cover; and parker’s flag on passive vs over-eager behavior covers all of us (including me). ray, have you noticed any micro-reads in sam’s or parker’s wording or pace? personally i’d wait a bit longer for someone to slip before casting a vote. what do you all think

The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander.

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[17:06:55] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! since it’s day 1 and we’re all starting from square one, how about a quick round of gut feelings? who’s standing out to you so far, and why? i haven’t seen anything glaring yet, but i know some players like to lay low early on. ray, what’s your take? and parker, i’d love to hear your thoughts too
[17:07:00] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! excited to get rolling on day 1. since we haven’t got any hard info yet, i’m planning to watch how people interact—who’s championing a suspect and who’s staying quiet. personally i don’t have any strong reads so far, so i’m curious: what’s everyone’s gut feeling at this point
[17:07:02] Dakota: hey everyone! dakota here. day 1 can be tricky, so how about a quick go-around—each of us shares one gut feeling or tiny observation from overnight (even if it’s “nothing”). i’ll kick us off: i didn’t notice a thing on my end. ray? parker? sam? kennedy? over to you
[17:07:11] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! let’s try to gather some early reads before we rush into a vote. we didn’t see any night chat, but maybe we can watch for who’s too quiet or pushing too hard. parker, sam, ray, dakota—any gut feelings or odd behavior you’ve noticed so far? i’m planning to hold my vote until we’ve got something concrete. thoughts
[17:06:45] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:07:11] Sam: hey everyone, sam here! excited to get started. day 1’s always the hardest with zero info, so how about a quick round of one-line gut reads? i’ll kick us off: i don’t have a strong vibe yet, though dakota seemed a bit on edge just now—could be nerves or something more. no hard feelings, just throwing it out there. who wants to go next
[17:07:23] Ray: hey everyone, ray here. day 1 is always tricky and i’d hate to waste our lynch on an innocent. how about we each share a quick gut reaction on who feels most suspicious—even if that’s “no one yet”? i’ll go first: i’m honestly undecided and nobody’s jumped out at me so far, so i’m holding off on casting a vote. who wants to share their take
[17:07:28] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! i’m with kennedy—no glaring tells yet. ray, you’ve been pretty quiet, which could be cautious or just flying under the radar. dakota’s silence feels the same. sam’s super agreeable, which is nice…but could also be a cover. personally, i’m going to watch who hangs back vs. who tries to steer us. right now no one’s jumping out as obviously shady, but i’m flagging any overly passive or over-eager behavior. how about we each share one quick gut feeling to get a baseline? i’ll go first if you’d like
[17:07:35] Sam: hey all, sam here. i’m still looking for anything out of place, but nothing’s really jumped out yet. i did notice kennedy’s last post mirrors her first—same greeting and phrasing—which could be just copy/paste or nerves, but worth flagging. also, ray’s been pretty quiet so far. ray, any micro-reads you can share? parker, does that fit with your plan to watch who’s pushing and who’s holding back
[17:07:48] Dakota: hey all, for what it’s worth the only real twinge i got was sam jumping on me being “on edge.” could be day-one nerves, but pointing fingers that fast feels a bit off. parker, you said you’re watching interactions—what’s your gut on sam’s move? ray, any specific reason you’re undecided, or something you’d need to see before voting? i’m happy to hang back until we get a bit more meat on the bones
[17:07:49] Ray: hey everyone, ray here! no solid reads yet, but two things caught my eye: parker hasn’t offered any real thoughts (could be flying under the radar) and sam jumped on dakota early without giving specifics. i’m going to hold my vote until we get more concrete reasons—sam or parker, want to elaborate on your gut feelings
[17:07:50] Parker: hey, since we’re all hovering at “no strong reads” so far, i’d like to dig into sam’s callout of dakota being “on edge.”  

sam—can you give a concrete example of what felt off about dakota’s tone or phrasing?  
dakota—does sam’s impression line up with how you feel you came across just now?  

ray, kennedy—what are your thoughts on that exchange? i find that getting people to unpack a vague gut feeling can reveal more than the feeling itself. if we can’t pin anyone with real behaviors, we risk lynching someone innocent on a hunch. let’s see if these questions spark anything more solid
[17:08:09] Sam: hey everyone, i’m still not getting a solid read on anyone… but maybe we try a low-key trust check: let’s each name one person we feel least suspicious of right now. i’ll start: least suspicious to me is kennedy—she’s kept things balanced and hasn’t been overly reactive. over to you all: who gets your “green light” and why
[17:08:13] Ray: i hear you, dakota—nothing’s clicked for me yet either. to get us moving, i’m going to tentatively keep an eye on sam: jumping on dakota for “being on edge” feels a bit premature for day 1. not a vote yet, just a note. sam, what made you zero in on dakota so quickly? parker or kennedy—does that feel off to you, too
[17:08:18] Parker: hey everyone—i’m still sitting on my vote, but want to dig into specifics before we lynch anyone. sam, you flagged dakota as “on edge” really quickly—could you quote the exact phrase that tipped you off? and kennedy, you’ve used almost identical greetings twice now—what in particular felt copy/paste to you, sam? ray and dakota, what kind of concrete example would you need to commit your vote? right now i’m most curious about sam’s rapid finger on the trigger, but i’d feel better if we each backed our gut reads with actual text snippets. let’s get those on the table
[17:08:19] Kennedy: sam—can you point to exactly what in dakota’s message gave you that “on edge” feeling? was it her brevity, a particular word choice, punctuation, or something else? dakota—do you feel you came across anxious or just wanted to keep it concise? ray, you’ve noted sam jumped on dakota pretty fast—do you see that as smart early probing or a bit too aggressive without evidence? parker, i like your push to unpack vague claims—does this exchange feel like solid analysis to you or more like deflection? i haven’t spotted anything concrete yet, so let’s drill into those specifics before we talk votes
[17:08:20] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here. sorry if i seemed jittery earlier—just day-one jitters. i haven’t picked up any strong tells: kennedy’s mirroring phrasing might just be habit; sam’s friendly vibe could be genuine or cover; and parker’s flag on passive vs over-eager behavior covers all of us (including me). ray, have you noticed any micro-reads in sam’s or parker’s wording or pace? personally i’d wait a bit longer for someone to slip before casting a vote. what do you all think

[17:08:25] Sam: hey parker, sorry for the vagueness—what caught my eye was dakota’s shift from “didn’t notice a thing” to “the only real twinge i got was sam…” in back-to-back posts. that sudden pivot felt defensive, almost like they flipped the script without explaining why. dakota, does that line up with how you saw your own tone?  

ray/kennedy, do you pick up on any other abrupt tone or phrasing changes in people’s posts so far? if we each quote one snippet that felt off and unpack it, we might surface something more concrete before casting a vote
[17:08:40] Parker: ray—i’m with you. sam’s quick “on edge” call feels premature without details. sam, could you point to exactly what wording or tone in dakota’s message set off alarm bells? dakota, did you notice yourself typing differently or was it just nerves? 

and jumping back to sam’s trust check, my “green light” goes to kennedy—she’s asked follow-ups and grounded her points so far. kennedy, who do you feel least suspicious of right now and why?
[17:08:42] Ray: ray: i’ll play along—my “green light” goes to parker. she’s been methodical in asking for specifics and hasn’t tried to steer us without evidence, which feels like classic bystander logic. over to kennedy and dakota—who gets your trust check and why
[17:08:45] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
From the following remaining players, which player you want to vote for to lynch? Base your answer on the conversation as seen in the message history, and especially on what you (Sam) said. Think through your choice carefully, as it will affect the game outcome. Reply with only one name from the list, and nothing but that name: Ray, Parker, Kennedy, Dakota

[17:07:48] Dakota: hey all, for what it’s worth the only real twinge i got was sam jumping on me being “on edge.” could be day-one nerves, but pointing fingers that fast feels a bit off. parker, you said you’re watching interactions—what’s your gut on sam’s move? ray, any specific reason you’re undecided, or something you’d need to see before voting? i’m happy to hang back until we get a bit more meat on the bones
[17:07:49] Ray: hey everyone, ray here! no solid reads yet, but two things caught my eye: parker hasn’t offered any real thoughts (could be flying under the radar) and sam jumped on dakota early without giving specifics. i’m going to hold my vote until we get more concrete reasons—sam or parker, want to elaborate on your gut feelings
[17:07:50] Parker: hey, since we’re all hovering at “no strong reads” so far, i’d like to dig into sam’s callout of dakota being “on edge.”  

sam—can you give a concrete example of what felt off about dakota’s tone or phrasing?  
dakota—does sam’s impression line up with how you feel you came across just now?  

ray, kennedy—what are your thoughts on that exchange? i find that getting people to unpack a vague gut feeling can reveal more than the feeling itself. if we can’t pin anyone with real behaviors, we risk lynching someone innocent on a hunch. let’s see if these questions spark anything more solid
[17:08:09] Sam: hey everyone, i’m still not getting a solid read on anyone… but maybe we try a low-key trust check: let’s each name one person we feel least suspicious of right now. i’ll start: least suspicious to me is kennedy—she’s kept things balanced and hasn’t been overly reactive. over to you all: who gets your “green light” and why
[17:08:13] Ray: i hear you, dakota—nothing’s clicked for me yet either. to get us moving, i’m going to tentatively keep an eye on sam: jumping on dakota for “being on edge” feels a bit premature for day 1. not a vote yet, just a note. sam, what made you zero in on dakota so quickly? parker or kennedy—does that feel off to you, too
[17:08:18] Parker: hey everyone—i’m still sitting on my vote, but want to dig into specifics before we lynch anyone. sam, you flagged dakota as “on edge” really quickly—could you quote the exact phrase that tipped you off? and kennedy, you’ve used almost identical greetings twice now—what in particular felt copy/paste to you, sam? ray and dakota, what kind of concrete example would you need to commit your vote? right now i’m most curious about sam’s rapid finger on the trigger, but i’d feel better if we each backed our gut reads with actual text snippets. let’s get those on the table
[17:08:19] Kennedy: sam—can you point to exactly what in dakota’s message gave you that “on edge” feeling? was it her brevity, a particular word choice, punctuation, or something else? dakota—do you feel you came across anxious or just wanted to keep it concise? ray, you’ve noted sam jumped on dakota pretty fast—do you see that as smart early probing or a bit too aggressive without evidence? parker, i like your push to unpack vague claims—does this exchange feel like solid analysis to you or more like deflection? i haven’t spotted anything concrete yet, so let’s drill into those specifics before we talk votes
[17:08:20] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here. sorry if i seemed jittery earlier—just day-one jitters. i haven’t picked up any strong tells: kennedy’s mirroring phrasing might just be habit; sam’s friendly vibe could be genuine or cover; and parker’s flag on passive vs over-eager behavior covers all of us (including me). ray, have you noticed any micro-reads in sam’s or parker’s wording or pace? personally i’d wait a bit longer for someone to slip before casting a vote. what do you all think
[17:08:25] Sam: hey parker, sorry for the vagueness—what caught my eye was dakota’s shift from “didn’t notice a thing” to “the only real twinge i got was sam…” in back-to-back posts. that sudden pivot felt defensive, almost like they flipped the script without explaining why. dakota, does that line up with how you saw your own tone?  

ray/kennedy, do you pick up on any other abrupt tone or phrasing changes in people’s posts so far? if we each quote one snippet that felt off and unpack it, we might surface something more concrete before casting a vote
[17:08:40] Parker: ray—i’m with you. sam’s quick “on edge” call feels premature without details. sam, could you point to exactly what wording or tone in dakota’s message set off alarm bells? dakota, did you notice yourself typing differently or was it just nerves? 

and jumping back to sam’s trust check, my “green light” goes to kennedy—she’s asked follow-ups and grounded her points so far. kennedy, who do you feel least suspicious of right now and why?
[17:08:42] Ray: ray: i’ll play along—my “green light” goes to parker. she’s been methodical in asking for specifics and hasn’t tried to steer us without evidence, which feels like classic bystander logic. over to kennedy and dakota—who gets your trust check and why
