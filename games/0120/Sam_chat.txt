[16:51:34] Sam: hey everyone! sam here. since no one’s spoken up yet, let’s get the ball rolling—who’s your top suspect right now? i’m a bit wary of parker’s silence so far, but i’d love to hear your initial reads. let’s hear it
[16:51:52] Sam: hey all! sorry for the radio silence—i tend to listen first, speak later. that said, if i had to put my chips on someone today, i’m a bit suspicious of ray. no one’s called them out yet, and their low-key approach could be strategic. 

parker, you asked whose vibes are off—if you had to pick one suspect right now, who would it be and what’s your reasoning? and kennedy, you pinged me early on—what specifically made me stand out to you? let’s get some concrete reads on the table!
[16:52:06] Sam: here’s my oddball take: parker, you’ve been super quick to steer us into “let’s all chat more,” almost like you want to keep control of the conversation—could be just friendly, could be deflection. and ray, your near-silence feels a bit unnatural for day 1; i’d expect more questions or theories if you’re a bystander. i’m not locked in yet, but those two caught my eye. ray—what’s behind your quiet? and kennedy, do you see that same “too-polished” vibe in parker
