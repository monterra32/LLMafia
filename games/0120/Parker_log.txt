## CONTENT: You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  + 
 + Do you understand the rules? +

[16:51:46] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! now that day’s underway, i’m curious if any of you have a gut feeling yet. personally, no one’s screaming “mafia” to me—i’m watching for extremes (like someone being way too chatty or totally stone-silent). what vibes are you all picking up so far
[16:51:52] Sam: hey all! sorry for the radio silence—i tend to listen first, speak later. that said, if i had to put my chips on someone today, i’m a bit suspicious of ray. no one’s called them out yet, and their low-key approach could be strategic. 

parker, you asked whose vibes are off—if you had to pick one suspect right now, who would it be and what’s your reasoning? and kennedy, you pinged me early on—what specifically made me stand out to you? let’s get some concrete reads on the table!
Do you want to send a message to the group chat now, or do you prefer to wait for now and see what messages others will send? Remember to choose to send a message only if your contribution to the discussion in the current time will be meaningful enough. Don't overflow the discussion with your messages! Pay attention to the amount of messages with your name compared to the amount of messages with names of other players and let them have their turn too! Check the speaker name in the last few messages, and decide accordingly based on whether you talked too much. Reply only with `<send>` if you want to send a message now, or only with `<wait>` if you want to wait for now, based on your decision!

## CONTENT: Your name is Parker.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  
You were assigned the following role: bystander.

[16:52:06] Sam: here’s my oddball take: parker, you’ve been super quick to steer us into “let’s all chat more,” almost like you want to keep control of the conversation—could be just friendly, could be deflection. and ray, your near-silence feels a bit unnatural for day 1; i’d expect more questions or theories if you’re a bystander. i’m not locked in yet, but those two caught my eye. ray—what’s behind your quiet? and kennedy, do you see that same “too-polished” vibe in parker
[16:52:07] Dakota: hey everyone—before we rush to vote on sam, can we dig into some concrete reasons? kennedy, you said your gut’s pinging on sam’s quiet start—what exactly stood out? parker, besides noting sam’s silence, what behavior tipped you off? ray, do you see anything odd in sam’s tone or parker’s quick pivot? and sam, can you share why you’ve been laying low instead of sparking more dialogue? i’d feel better making a call if we have specifics rather than just vibes
[16:52:08] Ray: hey everyone, i’m definitely picking up on sam’s ghosting of this convo—quietness can be a sign of lurking guilt. but i want to be sure before we start lynching. sam, any reason you’ve stayed so low-key? dakota, you’ve been eager to put the spotlight on sam—what vibe or detail are you picking up? parker, kennedy, do either of you feel ready to name your top suspect and why? maybe let’s each drop one name + one reason so we’ve got some real info before votes go in
[16:52:10] Kennedy: nice catch, dakota—i'll own my eagerness to spotlight sam. for my oddball, i’m zeroing in on parker. you’ve been great at asking questions, but when sam flipped one back at you, there was a split-second pause before you deflected. that hesitation—like you were weighing how much to reveal—felt off. parker, what’s your rawest suspicion right now? no need for full evidence, just one name or behavior that’s sticking with you
[16:52:29] Kennedy: alright, let’s put names on the table as ray suggested. i’m leaning sam – you’ve been radio-silent when pressed and haven’t followed up with any real questions or theories, which feels like a dodge. parker, dakota, ray – whose name and one concrete reason are you dropping next
[16:52:38] Ray: ray: i’m with dakota—let’s get concrete. parker, you’ve been steering the convo and flipping targets from sam to me in just a few lines; what exactly in our wording set off alarm bells for you? kennedy, you’ve mentioned “gut pings” and vibes—can you quote the exact phrase that pinged you? dakota, you’re asking for specifics—what’s one clear behavior or word you’ve noticed so far? let’s nail down real examples before we vote
[16:52:52] Dakota: dakota: i’m dropping parker—your constant push for “let’s all chat more” felt like controlling the narrative, but when sam asked you for specifics you froze for a split-second before deflecting. that hesitation screams deflection, not facilitation. parker, care to explain that pause

[16:51:17] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[16:51:26] Kennedy: hey hey everyone! kennedy here, ready to sleuth. no one’s gone yet, so we’ve got a clean slate—but that also means we need to start digging for clues quick. my gut’s pinging a little on sam’s quiet start (could be nothing, but could be hiding something). what are your first impressions? ray? parker? dakota? let’s hear your hunches
[16:51:28] Parker: hey everyone! excited to get started. any first impressions or gut feelings on who might be acting a bit off? i don’t have hard evidence yet but i’m curious who you all find suspicious so far. let’s share thoughts and see where it leads
[16:51:29] Dakota: hey everyone! day 1 can be tricky with zero info, so i’d love to get the ball rolling. i noticed sam hasn’t said much yet—could just be strategizing, but i’m curious: sam, what’s your gut read on who might be sketchy today? and ray, parker, kennedy—any early instincts or suspicious vibes you’re picking up? let’s share our first impressions before votes start flying
[16:51:34] Sam: hey everyone! sam here. since no one’s spoken up yet, let’s get the ball rolling—who’s your top suspect right now? i’m a bit wary of parker’s silence so far, but i’d love to hear your initial reads. let’s hear it
[16:51:43] Ray: hey everyone, ray here! two minutes isn’t much—any gut feelings on who seems fishy? i’m still on the fence but curious what vibes you’re all getting so far
[16:51:43] Parker: hey kennedy, great point on sam’s quiet start—it does stick out. that said, ray’s been oddly neutral too—haven’t heard much from you, ray. sam, any reason you’re laying low? dakota, you’ve got a killer instinct for vibes—what’s your read? personally i’d love to see more back-and-forth before we lock in a vote. let’s get those hunches on the table
[16:51:44] Dakota: dakota: hey everyone! nice kick-off, kennedy and parker. i’ll admit sam’s quietness caught my eye too—but sometimes folks are just collecting their thoughts. i’m also curious about ray’s near-silence so far. parker, i like your friendly vibe, but being “too nice” can also be a good cover. how about this: let’s each name one thing that struck us as odd about someone else—no deep evidence needed, just gut impressions. i’ll go first: i felt a slight hesitation in kennedy’s phrasing (“my gut’s pinging”), like you really want us to zero in on sam asap. alright, ray, sam, kennedy—what’s your oddball observation
[16:51:46] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! now that day’s underway, i’m curious if any of you have a gut feeling yet. personally, no one’s screaming “mafia” to me—i’m watching for extremes (like someone being way too chatty or totally stone-silent). what vibes are you all picking up so far
[16:51:52] Sam: hey all! sorry for the radio silence—i tend to listen first, speak later. that said, if i had to put my chips on someone today, i’m a bit suspicious of ray. no one’s called them out yet, and their low-key approach could be strategic.

## CONTENT: Your name is Parker.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [16:51:17].

It seems like most of the group agrees on Sam, so I’ll say, “I’m dropping Sam because he hasn’t contributed anything new.” This keeps the focus on Sam while inviting input from the others.", type='summary_text')]

## CONTENT: Sure—Dakota, that “hesitation” was just me taking a beat to figure out how to answer under everyone’s fire of questions, not a mafia freeze. But to get concrete, here’s my pick: I’m dropping Sam. He’s been radio-silent until cornered, then immediately deflects back at me and Ray without offering a single original read or theory. That pattern feels more like mafia stalling than bystander discussion. Ray, Kennedy—do you see that same loop in Sam’s posts? Sam, care to explain why you’ve held back on sharing any solo suspicions?

[16:51:17] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[16:51:26] Kennedy: hey hey everyone! kennedy here, ready to sleuth. no one’s gone yet, so we’ve got a clean slate—but that also means we need to start digging for clues quick. my gut’s pinging a little on sam’s quiet start (could be nothing, but could be hiding something). what are your first impressions? ray? parker? dakota? let’s hear your hunches
[16:51:28] Parker: hey everyone! excited to get started. any first impressions or gut feelings on who might be acting a bit off? i don’t have hard evidence yet but i’m curious who you all find suspicious so far. let’s share thoughts and see where it leads
[16:51:29] Dakota: hey everyone! day 1 can be tricky with zero info, so i’d love to get the ball rolling. i noticed sam hasn’t said much yet—could just be strategizing, but i’m curious: sam, what’s your gut read on who might be sketchy today? and ray, parker, kennedy—any early instincts or suspicious vibes you’re picking up? let’s share our first impressions before votes start flying
[16:51:34] Sam: hey everyone! sam here. since no one’s spoken up yet, let’s get the ball rolling—who’s your top suspect right now? i’m a bit wary of parker’s silence so far, but i’d love to hear your initial reads. let’s hear it
[16:51:43] Ray: hey everyone, ray here! two minutes isn’t much—any gut feelings on who seems fishy? i’m still on the fence but curious what vibes you’re all getting so far
[16:51:43] Parker: hey kennedy, great point on sam’s quiet start—it does stick out. that said, ray’s been oddly neutral too—haven’t heard much from you, ray. sam, any reason you’re laying low? dakota, you’ve got a killer instinct for vibes—what’s your read? personally i’d love to see more back-and-forth before we lock in a vote. let’s get those hunches on the table
[16:51:44] Dakota: dakota: hey everyone! nice kick-off, kennedy and parker. i’ll admit sam’s quietness caught my eye too—but sometimes folks are just collecting their thoughts. i’m also curious about ray’s near-silence so far. parker, i like your friendly vibe, but being “too nice” can also be a good cover. how about this: let’s each name one thing that struck us as odd about someone else—no deep evidence needed, just gut impressions. i’ll go first: i felt a slight hesitation in kennedy’s phrasing (“my gut’s pinging”), like you really want us to zero in on sam asap. alright, ray, sam, kennedy—what’s your oddball observation
[16:51:46] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! now that day’s underway, i’m curious if any of you have a gut feeling yet. personally, no one’s screaming “mafia” to me—i’m watching for extremes (like someone being way too chatty or totally stone-silent). what vibes are you all picking up so far
[16:51:52] Sam: hey all! sorry for the radio silence—i tend to listen first, speak later. that said, if i had to put my chips on someone today, i’m a bit suspicious of ray. no one’s called them out yet, and their low-key approach could be strategic. 

parker, you asked whose vibes are off—if you had to pick one suspect right now, who would it be and what’s your reasoning? and kennedy, you pinged me early on—what specifically made me stand out to you? let’s get some concrete reads on the table!
[16:52:06] Sam: here’s my oddball take: parker, you’ve been super quick to steer us into “let’s all chat more,” almost like you want to keep control of the conversation—could be just friendly, could be deflection. and ray, your near-silence feels a bit unnatural for day 1; i’d expect more questions or theories if you’re a bystander. i’m not locked in yet, but those two caught my eye. ray—what’s behind your quiet? and kennedy, do you see that same “too-polished” vibe in parker
[16:52:07] Dakota: hey everyone—before we rush to vote on sam, can we dig into some concrete reasons? kennedy, you said your gut’s pinging on sam’s quiet start—what exactly stood out? parker, besides noting sam’s silence, what behavior tipped you off? ray, do you see anything odd in sam’s tone or parker’s quick pivot? and sam, can you share why you’ve been laying low instead of sparking more dialogue? i’d feel better making a call if we have specifics rather than just vibes
[16:52:08] Ray: hey everyone, i’m definitely picking up on sam’s ghosting of this convo—quietness can be a sign of lurking guilt. but i want to be sure before we start lynching. sam, any reason you’ve stayed so low-key? dakota, you’ve been eager to put the spotlight on sam—what vibe or detail are you picking up? parker, kennedy, do either of you feel ready to name your top suspect and why? maybe let’s each drop one name + one reason so we’ve got some real info before votes go in
[16:52:10] Kennedy: nice catch, dakota—i'll own my eagerness to spotlight sam. for my oddball, i’m zeroing in on parker. you’ve been great at asking questions, but when sam flipped one back at you, there was a split-second pause before you deflected. that hesitation—like you were weighing how much to reveal—felt off. parker, what’s your rawest suspicion right now? no need for full evidence, just one name or behavior that’s sticking with you
[16:52:29] Kennedy: alright, let’s put names on the table as ray suggested. i’m leaning sam – you’ve been radio-silent when pressed and haven’t followed up with any real questions or theories, which feels like a dodge. parker, dakota, ray – whose name and one concrete reason are you dropping next
[16:52:38] Ray: ray: i’m with dakota—let’s get concrete. parker, you’ve been steering the convo and flipping targets from sam to me in just a few lines; what exactly in our wording set off alarm bells for you? kennedy, you’ve mentioned “gut pings” and vibes—can you quote the exact phrase that pinged you? dakota, you’re asking for specifics—what’s one clear behavior or word you’ve noticed so far? let’s nail down real examples before we vote
[16:52:52] Dakota: dakota: i’m dropping parker—your constant push for “let’s all chat more” felt like controlling the narrative, but when sam asked you for specifics you froze for a split-second before deflecting. that hesitation screams deflection, not facilitation. parker, care to explain that pause
[16:52:56] Parker: i’m leaning toward ray—their near-silence and wishy-washy “on the fence” comments feel like a dodge tactic to stay under the radar. kennedy, sam asked what specifically about ray’s quiet start triggered your gut ping—can you point to the exact phrasing or moment that stood out
[16:53:04] Ray: i’m naming parker – when everyone was pressed for a suspect you paused for a beat and then immediately steered us onto someone else instead of answering. that hesitation plus the quick deflection feels off to me
[16:53:17] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
From the following remaining players, which player you want to vote for to lynch? Base your answer on the conversation as seen in the message history, and especially on what you (Parker) said.

## CONTENT: Your name is Parker.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  
You were assigned the following role: bystander.
