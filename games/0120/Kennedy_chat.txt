[16:51:26] Kennedy: hey hey everyone! kennedy here, ready to sleuth. no one’s gone yet, so we’ve got a clean slate—but that also means we need to start digging for clues quick. my gut’s pinging a little on sam’s quiet start (could be nothing, but could be hiding something). what are your first impressions? ray? parker? dakota? let’s hear your hunches
[16:51:46] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! now that day’s underway, i’m curious if any of you have a gut feeling yet. personally, no one’s screaming “mafia” to me—i’m watching for extremes (like someone being way too chatty or totally stone-silent). what vibes are you all picking up so far
[16:52:10] Kennedy: nice catch, dakota—i'll own my eagerness to spotlight sam. for my oddball, i’m zeroing in on parker. you’ve been great at asking questions, but when sam flipped one back at you, there was a split-second pause before you deflected. that hesitation—like you were weighing how much to reveal—felt off. parker, what’s your rawest suspicion right now? no need for full evidence, just one name or behavior that’s sticking with you
[16:52:29] Kennedy: alright, let’s put names on the table as ray suggested. i’m leaning sam – you’ve been radio-silent when pressed and haven’t followed up with any real questions or theories, which feels like a dodge. parker, dakota, ray – whose name and one concrete reason are you dropping next
[16:56:30] Kennedy: ugh, i’m bummed we lost sam last night. now it’s just the three of us—one mafia, two civilians, zero room for error. here’s my read: ray, you were practically radio-silent day one, then only jumped in when the heat was on. that flip feels more like dodge tactic than genuine uncertainty. dakota, what’s your take on that sudden shift? ray, care to explain going from ghost mode to steering the convo
[16:56:55] Kennedy: ray, fair point—here’s why i pivoted so fast: once parker went down and turned out town-aligned, my sam-silence theory was busted, so i immediately reset and scanned vote patterns. i noticed you cast a lone vote on parker early, then mostly lurked until firing at me just now. that “vote, wait, strike” rhythm feels like classic mafia testing the waters. dakota, does that pattern stand out to you too? if we need a lead suspect, i’m pointing back at ray
