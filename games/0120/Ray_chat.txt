[16:51:43] Ray: hey everyone, ray here! two minutes isn’t much—any gut feelings on who seems fishy? i’m still on the fence but curious what vibes you’re all getting so far
[16:52:08] Ray: hey everyone, i’m definitely picking up on sam’s ghosting of this convo—quietness can be a sign of lurking guilt. but i want to be sure before we start lynching. sam, any reason you’ve stayed so low-key? dakota, you’ve been eager to put the spotlight on sam—what vibe or detail are you picking up? parker, kennedy, do either of you feel ready to name your top suspect and why? maybe let’s each drop one name + one reason so we’ve got some real info before votes go in
[16:52:38] Ray: ray: i’m with dakota—let’s get concrete. parker, you’ve been steering the convo and flipping targets from sam to me in just a few lines; what exactly in our wording set off alarm bells for you? kennedy, you’ve mentioned “gut pings” and vibes—can you quote the exact phrase that pinged you? dakota, you’re asking for specifics—what’s one clear behavior or word you’ve noticed so far? let’s nail down real examples before we vote
[16:53:04] Ray: i’m naming parker – when everyone was pressed for a suspect you paused for a beat and then immediately steered us onto someone else instead of answering. that hesitation plus the quick deflection feels off to me
[16:56:22] Ray: hey everyone, rough morning. we just lost parker and sam, so the mafia clearly knows what they’re doing. i’m actually looking at kennedy right now: you came out strong with that “gut’s pinging” on sam, but the moment sam was gone you dropped it entirely—no follow-up, no re-evaluation. that shift feels odd for someone so confident. dakota, you’ve been great at pressing for specifics—what’s your read on this? kennedy, can you talk me through why you pivoted so quickly
[16:57:02] Ray: great work everyone on the last lynch. now that sam’s gone, it’s just the three of us. kennedy—you’ve already locked in your vote today, but what’s driving that pick? dakota, what behaviors from kennedy or me have jumped out at you so far? i’m picking up that kennedy’s swift, polished vote felt almost rehearsed. i’m leaning her way, but before i finalize my vote i want to hear your takes
