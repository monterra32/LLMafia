[17:22:25] Sam: hey everyone—sam here! excited to get started. before we jump into any voting, i’d love to hear first impressions. i’m noticing ray’s been pretty quiet so far—could be low-key strategy or someone trying to fly under the radar. parker, kennedy, dakota, what are you all feeling? any gut reactions or playstyle reads so far? let’s try to avoid a random lynch and throw out our initial thoughts
[17:22:51] Sam: hey everyone, sam here! to kick things off, how about we each share a quick gut feeling about who seems off? ray, parker, kennedy, dakota—feel free to jump in first, and i’ll share mine right after
[17:23:12] Sam: i’m going to throw my one-word hunch out there too: parker. they’ve been super quick to drive the “let’s hear everyone’s thoughts” train—could be genuine town organizing, or a way to scoop up intel before anyone else speaks. 

parker, how do you feel about dakota’s “eager/fidgety” call on you?  
kennedy, ray—do you see that same energy from parker, or is your gut still pinging someone quieter?  
dakota, did your initial read on parker stick, or have you pivoted?  
let’s see if we can tighten these observations before anyone’s on the chopping block
[17:23:35] Sam: okay, here’s where i’m at: ray’s radio-silent start is giving me low-key mafia vibes, and dakota’s been pretty pushy steering the chat. i’m less worried about parker/kennedy for now since they’ve been more balanced. to get concrete, let’s each name one suspect—mine’s ray. parker? kennedy? dakota? ray? who are you feeling and why
[17:24:00] Sam: ray, fair point—i do tend to jump in fast, but it’s just how i like to get the ball rolling. that said, i’m actually more curious about parker here: you’ve driven the question round from the start—town-organizer energy or a way to scoop up reactions? parker, how do you feel about that read? 

kennedy, you’ve been calm and consistent—now that you’ve heard all our mini-hunches, whose vibe is standing out stronger to you: me, parker, or someone else? 

dakota, you’ve flagged both me and parker—do you have a firmer lean now? let’s try to narrow it to one or two suspects before we dive into votes
