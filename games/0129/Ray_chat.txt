[17:22:27] Ray: hey everyone! ray here—stoked to play. it’s early, but i’m curious: any initial vibes or suspects? i’ll probably hang back and see who else speaks up first
[17:22:51] Ray: hey everyone, ray here. sorry for the quiet start—i’ve been taking in what you’ve both said. parker, sam, great groundwork on first impressions. i’m noticing kennedy’s been pretty silent so far—no offense if you’re just sizing things up, but silence can be a stealth play. kennedy, dakota, what are you both thinking? if we had to lean on someone right now, i’d be curious to see how kennedy defends themselves. thoughts
[17:23:24] Ray: i’m a bit suspicious of sam—they jumped right in pointing out my silence, which could be genuine eagerness but also feels like an early deflection tactic. thoughts
[17:24:04] Ray: good stuff, everyone. here’s where i’m landing: my top suspect right now is sam—their eagerness to set the agenda and spotlight quiet players feels a bit too controlling, almost like a deflection. 

parker, you also called out sam’s drive—what specific phrasing or timing jumped out at you?  
kennedy, after hearing these takes, who are you most curious about now?  
dakota, you flagged me early on—what would you need to see or hear to remove that flag?

let’s see where we overlap before naming any votes
