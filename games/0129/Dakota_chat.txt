[17:22:35] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here! day 1 can feel awkward with no one saying a word, so let’s break the ice: how about a quick one-sentence gut reaction? i’ll start—i’m getting a slightly eager/fidgety vibe from parker, which makes me raise an eyebrow. kennedy seems pretty laid-back so far. who’s next
[17:22:59] Dakota: dakota: hey y’all! dakota here—excited for day 1. so far, ray, you’ve been pretty quiet. could be a stealth tactic or just taking it in, so i’m putting a small flag on that. sam jumped right into spotlighting ray, and parker & kennedy followed up quick with gut reads—nothing wrong with it, but curious how you all landed on that. ray, any thoughts now you’ve heard these calls? and parker/kennedy, do you both agree sam’s onto something, or is someone else catching your eye? just gathering initial vibes before we decide
[17:23:17] Dakota: i’m with ray that hanging back can be smart—gives us a chance to catch tone shifts once names start flying. ray, what specific slip or vibe are you hoping to spot before diving in? sam, when you zeroed in on ray’s silence, was it the sudden call-out or just a gut twitch about his quiet? kennedy, you’ve stayed consistent—after hearing these takes, is anyone’s read standing out more to you? and parker, you say you’re pumped—would you rather heat up day 1 quickly or see a few more rounds of hunches before we even think about voting
[17:23:41] Dakota: dakota: okay, let’s lock down a quick hunch round before we dive into votes. i’m sticking with parker—still getting those eager/fidgety vibes. sam? ray? kennedy? name your top suspect and a one-sentence why, then we can see if anyone’s pulling ahead
