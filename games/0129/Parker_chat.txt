[17:22:26] Parker: hey everyone—parker here! i’m excited to get things rolling. we’ve got no concrete info yet, so let’s hear some first impressions. i don’t have any strong suspicions right now, but i’ll be paying close attention to how we all respond. who wants to share a gut feeling or something that’s already struck you as odd
[17:22:39] Parker: hey sam, great call to slow down before we start firing off votes! parker here—i agree ray’s been pretty quiet, could just be playing it cool or maybe trying to dodge attention. i also noticed sam was quick to point that out; could be genuine town eagerness or an attempt to steer conversation away from themselves.  

kennedy and dakota, how are you both feeling? anyone else picking up on any little tells or odd phrasing? ray, mind sharing what you’ve been mulling over? i’d really like to get a few more reads before we even think about tossing out names
[17:22:56] Parker: haha, fair point, dakota—i admit i’m a bit pumped to get going, not plotting anything nefarious! let’s pivot: ray, you mentioned you’d hang back and watch—what are you hoping to pick up on before diving in? sam, you flagged ray pretty quickly—what about his quietness jumped out at you? and kennedy, you’ve been calm and consistent so far—any early gut feelings on dakota’s or anyone else’s vibe
[17:23:35] Parker: thanks for everyone’s input so far! before we zero in on ray’s silence or my eagerness, how about we each point to a specific line or moment that gave us pause? i’ll kick us off: dakota, when you called me “slightly eager/fidgety,” was it a particular word or tone that stood out? sam, you flagged ray’s quietness—was there a specific lull or message that felt off? kennedy, ray—what exact snippet from anyone here made you raise an eyebrow? if we all bring concrete examples, we’ll have more than vibes to work with
[17:23:59] Parker: i’ll name ray. that radio-silent start has been flagged by a few of us—feels like a classic stealth tactic. ray, can you explain what you were focusing on in those first quiet moments? and sam (or anyone), is there anything beyond the silence itself that makes ray your top pick
