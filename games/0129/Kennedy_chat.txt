[17:22:29] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! ready to kick off day 1. i don’t have any solid info yet, so how about we each share our first gut feeling? sam—want to start us off? or feel free, parker, ray, dakota—whoever’s got the strongest hunch so far
[17:22:46] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! since it’s super early and we’ve only got vibes so far, how about a quick “hunch round”? let’s each name one person we’re even just a little bit suspicious of—and why. i’ll start: ray’s been pretty quiet, which makes me wonder if they’re just cautious or trying to fly under the radar. what about you all—who’s your tiny red flag so far
[17:23:19] Kennedy: thanks for chiming in, dakota. my gut: sam’s eagerness to steer feels a bit forced—could be genuine town energy or a mafia deflection—and ray’s silence is making me wary. i’m also noting parker’s formal questioning style. ray, what’s the strongest impression you’ve formed so far
[17:23:53] Kennedy: hey all, i’m leaning strongly towards parker—your eagerness to corral everyone’s thoughts early felt more like an info grab than genuine chit-chat. to help us focus, let’s each name our top suspect and back it up with one specific thing they said or did. ray—who’s on your shortlist and what moment sold you on them? sam, dakota—you’re up next
[17:24:09] Kennedy: my hunch is sam—they jumped in super early spotlighting ray’s silence and have been driving our reads in a way that feels more like deflection than genuine curiosity. ray, dakota, do you see that same push from sam, or is someone else sticking out to you now
