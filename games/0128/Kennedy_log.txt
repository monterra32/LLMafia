## CONTENT: You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  + 
 + Do you understand the rules? +

## CONTENT: Your name is Kennedy.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  
You were assigned the following role: bystander.

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[17:18:52] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:19:09] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! i don’t have any rock-solid reads yet—ray’s been awfully quiet, which could be a “blend in” play or just strategy. how’s everyone else feeling? any early suspicions or gut instincts before we lock in a vote
[17:19:10] Sam: hey everyone! i’m sam. since no one got taken overnight, we’re starting with a clean slate and no hard evidence yet. to kick things off, let’s each share one quick gut suspicion. i’ll go first: parker’s been awfully quiet so far, feels like they’re staying under the radar a bit too smoothly. how about everyone else—who’s on your list and why
[17:19:13] Ray: hey everyone, ray here! to get the ball rolling, how about we each share one person we’re feeling suspicious of and a quick reason? i’ll start—i’ve noticed parker’s been pretty quiet so far, which could mean he’s trying to fly under the radar… or maybe he’s just shy. who’s up next
[17:19:13] Dakota: hey everyone! dakota here—no casualties so far, so it looks like the mafia’s playing it safe. i’m the type to hang back and observe early on—anyone else feel more comfortable diving into discussions right away, or do you prefer gathering info before making a move? i’d love to get a sense of everyone’s playstyle to spot patterns later on. what do you all think
[17:19:15] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! i don’t have any solid reads yet—everyone’s been pretty quiet. before we rush to vote, does anyone have even a small thing that felt off? if we can share our gut impressions, we’ll have something to go on rather than just picking at random. what’s everyone thinking so far
[17:19:20] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! let’s get the ball rolling—did anyone catch vibes last night? i noticed sam was pretty quiet, while ray jumped right in with chatty “good mornings.” kennedy and dakota were more middle-of-the-road. who else picked up on anything that felt off? maybe sharing our first impressions can help us avoid a random lynch
[17:19:29] Ray: hey everyone, ray here! sorry for the silence—i was grabbing a quick snack irl. diving in now: i agree parker’s quiet start is eyebrow-raising, but i’m also finding sam’s swift push on parker a bit too neat. and i haven’t heard much from kennedy yet—no takes of their own. at the moment i’m oscillating between parker and sam as early suspects. what about you, dakota? and kennedy, any initial gut feelings before we start locking in votes
[17:19:30] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! i’m the type to dive in early—i find quick back-and-forth really helps me gauge tone and spot odd reactions—but i still like to step back when things get heated. quick gut check: i actually find sam’s immediate finger-point at parker a bit off. then ray echoed it right after—two people zeroing in on the exact same quiet target this fast feels a little coordinated. not saying parker’s innocent, but i want to see more than “quiet = mafia” logic before we jump. 

parker, how are you feeling about getting called out already? dakota, does this pairing of sam and ray register for you as a possible bandwagon, or do you see something i’m missing? let’s see who else has thoughts before we cast any votes
[17:19:31] Sam: hey everyone! sam here. parker’s point on ray is interesting—silence could be a sneaky mafia tactic or just a cautious bystander move. i’m still on the fence. kennedy, dakota, any thoughts? and parker, what about ray’s quiet struck you as more “mafia cover” than just strategic silence? let’s try to gather a bit more before we cast any votes
[17:19:32] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here! i’m not totally sold on parker being the culprit—silence could just be a play style. what struck me more is how quickly sam (and ray echoing) zeroed in on parker. feels a bit like bandwagoning. my gut for now is on sam for moving so fast without much to go on. kennedy, what’s your take
Do you want to send a message to the group chat now, or do you prefer to wait for now and see what messages others will send? Remember to choose to send a message only if your contribution to the discussion in the current time will be meaningful enough. Don't overflow the discussion with your messages! Pay attention to the amount of messages with your name compared to the amount of messages with names of other players and let them have their turn too!

rather than lock in on parker right now, let’s each throw out a second suspect or share one specific read. i’ll go: ray, your quick flips between targets could just be meaty probing, but it also looks like deflection—what’s your deeper reasoning? over to you all before we cast votes
[17:19:54] Dakota: dakota: i like kennedy’s point about avoiding a bandwagon—quiet alone isn’t enough. let’s each name one concrete phrase or moment that raised our suspicions. i’ll go first: sam, in your very first post you called parker “staying under the radar,” but you didn’t point to any actual wording—what in parker’s message made you feel that way? parker, same to you: what in ray’s chatty “good mornings” rang mafia alarms beyond just being talkative? once we have those specifics, we’ll have a clearer picture before casting votes. who’s next

[17:19:29] Ray: hey everyone, ray here! sorry for the silence—i was grabbing a quick snack irl. diving in now: i agree parker’s quiet start is eyebrow-raising, but i’m also finding sam’s swift push on parker a bit too neat. and i haven’t heard much from kennedy yet—no takes of their own. at the moment i’m oscillating between parker and sam as early suspects. what about you, dakota? and kennedy, any initial gut feelings before we start locking in votes
[17:19:30] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! i’m the type to dive in early—i find quick back-and-forth really helps me gauge tone and spot odd reactions—but i still like to step back when things get heated. quick gut check: i actually find sam’s immediate finger-point at parker a bit off. then ray echoed it right after—two people zeroing in on the exact same quiet target this fast feels a little coordinated. not saying parker’s innocent, but i want to see more than “quiet = mafia” logic before we jump. 

parker, how are you feeling about getting called out already? dakota, does this pairing of sam and ray register for you as a possible bandwagon, or do you see something i’m missing? let’s see who else has thoughts before we cast any votes
[17:19:31] Sam: hey everyone! sam here. parker’s point on ray is interesting—silence could be a sneaky mafia tactic or just a cautious bystander move. i’m still on the fence. kennedy, dakota, any thoughts? and parker, what about ray’s quiet struck you as more “mafia cover” than just strategic silence? let’s try to gather a bit more before we cast any votes
[17:19:32] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here! i’m not totally sold on parker being the culprit—silence could just be a play style. what struck me more is how quickly sam (and ray echoing) zeroed in on parker. feels a bit like bandwagoning. my gut for now is on sam for moving so fast without much to go on. kennedy, what’s your take
[17:19:49] Kennedy: hey everyone—i’m noticing a pattern: parker’s quiet start gets flagged by both sam and ray, and then sam doubled down on it right away. are we echoing each other, or is there real substance here? sam, can you dig into what specifically felt off about parker’s vibes? parker, how do you respond to ray’s “blend in” theory? and dakota, i’d love your gut read—any initial moves on your radar? right now i’m suspicious of the quick tag-team on parker, but i want more clarity before we lock in a vote
[17:19:50] Sam: kennedy, you’re right—i jumped on parker too fast. i’m happy to step back. parker, you flagged me for being quiet—what’s your usual day-one playstyle? ray, you echoed my pick almost immediately—what else are you seeing beyond “quiet = suspicious”? dakota, you’ve been watching us all—does anyone else stand out? 

rather than lock in on parker right now, let’s each throw out a second suspect or share one specific read. i’ll go: ray, your quick flips between targets could just be meaty probing, but it also looks like deflection—what’s your deeper reasoning? over to you all before we cast votes
[17:19:54] Dakota: dakota: i like kennedy’s point about avoiding a bandwagon—quiet alone isn’t enough. let’s each name one concrete phrase or moment that raised our suspicions. i’ll go first: sam, in your very first post you called parker “staying under the radar,” but you didn’t point to any actual wording—what in parker’s message made you feel that way? parker, same to you: what in ray’s chatty “good mornings” rang mafia alarms beyond just being talkative? once we have those specifics, we’ll have a clearer picture before casting votes. who’s next
[17:20:00] Ray: hey everyone—totally get wanting to avoid a random lynch. i’m leaning into parker’s read on sam: they were really quiet even after being called out and haven’t offered much in the way of reads or defenses. between dakota and kennedy, i’d say dakota’s comments feel more concrete, whereas kennedy’s stayed pretty neutral and hasn’t given us much to work with. for now sam is my top vote. kennedy—how are you feeling about this? any strong counterpoints before we lock it in
Do you want to send a message to the group chat now, or do you prefer to wait for now and see what messages others will send? Remember to choose to send a message only if your contribution to the discussion in the current time will be meaningful enough. Don't overflow the discussion with your messages! Pay attention to the amount of messages with your name compared to the amount of messages with names of other players and let them have their turn too! Check the speaker name in the last few messages, and decide accordingly based on whether you talked too much. Reply only with `<send>` if you want to send a message now, or only with `<wait>` if you want to wait for now, based on your decision!

[17:19:09] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! i don’t have any rock-solid reads yet—ray’s been awfully quiet, which could be a “blend in” play or just strategy. how’s everyone else feeling? any early suspicions or gut instincts before we lock in a vote
[17:19:10] Sam: hey everyone! i’m sam. since no one got taken overnight, we’re starting with a clean slate and no hard evidence yet. to kick things off, let’s each share one quick gut suspicion. i’ll go first: parker’s been awfully quiet so far, feels like they’re staying under the radar a bit too smoothly. how about everyone else—who’s on your list and why
[17:19:13] Ray: hey everyone, ray here! to get the ball rolling, how about we each share one person we’re feeling suspicious of and a quick reason? i’ll start—i’ve noticed parker’s been pretty quiet so far, which could mean he’s trying to fly under the radar… or maybe he’s just shy. who’s up next
[17:19:13] Dakota: hey everyone! dakota here—no casualties so far, so it looks like the mafia’s playing it safe. i’m the type to hang back and observe early on—anyone else feel more comfortable diving into discussions right away, or do you prefer gathering info before making a move? i’d love to get a sense of everyone’s playstyle to spot patterns later on. what do you all think

[17:19:13] Ray: hey everyone, ray here! to get the ball rolling, how about we each share one person we’re feeling suspicious of and a quick reason? i’ll start—i’ve noticed parker’s been pretty quiet so far, which could mean he’s trying to fly under the radar… or maybe he’s just shy. who’s up next
[17:19:13] Dakota: hey everyone! dakota here—no casualties so far, so it looks like the mafia’s playing it safe. i’m the type to hang back and observe early on—anyone else feel more comfortable diving into discussions right away, or do you prefer gathering info before making a move? i’d love to get a sense of everyone’s playstyle to spot patterns later on. what do you all think
[17:19:15] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! i don’t have any solid reads yet—everyone’s been pretty quiet. before we rush to vote, does anyone have even a small thing that felt off? if we can share our gut impressions, we’ll have something to go on rather than just picking at random. what’s everyone thinking so far
[17:19:20] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! let’s get the ball rolling—did anyone catch vibes last night? i noticed sam was pretty quiet, while ray jumped right in with chatty “good mornings.” kennedy and dakota were more middle-of-the-road. who else picked up on anything that felt off? maybe sharing our first impressions can help us avoid a random lynch
[17:19:29] Ray: hey everyone, ray here! sorry for the silence—i was grabbing a quick snack irl. diving in now: i agree parker’s quiet start is eyebrow-raising, but i’m also finding sam’s swift push on parker a bit too neat. and i haven’t heard much from kennedy yet—no takes of their own. at the moment i’m oscillating between parker and sam as early suspects. what about you, dakota? and kennedy, any initial gut feelings before we start locking in votes
[17:19:30] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! i’m the type to dive in early—i find quick back-and-forth really helps me gauge tone and spot odd reactions—but i still like to step back when things get heated. quick gut check: i actually find sam’s immediate finger-point at parker a bit off. then ray echoed it right after—two people zeroing in on the exact same quiet target this fast feels a little coordinated. not saying parker’s innocent, but i want to see more than “quiet = mafia” logic before we jump. 

parker, how are you feeling about getting called out already? dakota, does this pairing of sam and ray register for you as a possible bandwagon, or do you see something i’m missing? let’s see who else has thoughts before we cast any votes
[17:19:31] Sam: hey everyone! sam here. parker’s point on ray is interesting—silence could be a sneaky mafia tactic or just a cautious bystander move. i’m still on the fence. kennedy, dakota, any thoughts? and parker, what about ray’s quiet struck you as more “mafia cover” than just strategic silence? let’s try to gather a bit more before we cast any votes
[17:19:32] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here! i’m not totally sold on parker being the culprit—silence could just be a play style. what struck me more is how quickly sam (and ray echoing) zeroed in on parker. feels a bit like bandwagoning. my gut for now is on sam for moving so fast without much to go on. kennedy, what’s your take
[17:19:49] Kennedy: hey everyone—i’m noticing a pattern: parker’s quiet start gets flagged by both sam and ray, and then sam doubled down on it right away. are we echoing each other, or is there real substance here? sam, can you dig into what specifically felt off about parker’s vibes? parker, how do you respond to ray’s “blend in” theory? and dakota, i’d love your gut read—any initial moves on your radar? right now i’m suspicious of the quick tag-team on parker, but i want more clarity before we lock in a vote
[17:19:50] Sam: kennedy, you’re right—i jumped on parker too fast. i’m happy to step back. parker, you flagged me for being quiet—what’s your usual day-one playstyle? ray, you echoed my pick almost immediately—what else are you seeing beyond “quiet = suspicious”? dakota, you’ve been watching us all—does anyone else stand out? 

rather than lock in on parker right now, let’s each throw out a second suspect or share one specific read. i’ll go: ray, your quick flips between targets could just be meaty probing, but it also looks like deflection—what’s your deeper reasoning? over to you all before we cast votes
[17:19:54] Dakota: dakota: i like kennedy’s point about avoiding a bandwagon—quiet alone isn’t enough. let’s each name one concrete phrase or moment that raised our suspicions. i’ll go first: sam, in your very first post you called parker “staying under the radar,” but you didn’t point to any actual wording—what in parker’s message made you feel that way? parker, same to you: what in ray’s chatty “good mornings” rang mafia alarms beyond just being talkative? once we have those specifics, we’ll have a clearer picture before casting votes. who’s next
[17:20:00] Ray: hey everyone—totally get wanting to avoid a random lynch. i’m leaning into parker’s read on sam: they were really quiet even after being called out and haven’t offered much in the way of reads or defenses. between dakota and kennedy, i’d say dakota’s comments feel more concrete, whereas kennedy’s stayed pretty neutral and hasn’t given us much to work with. for now sam is my top vote. kennedy—how are you feeling about this? any strong counterpoints before we lock it in
[17:20:15] Parker: thanks for chiming in, dakota and kennedy—i’m with you on the bandwagon vibes from sam and ray. sam, you zeroed in on me super fast—what made you so sure, and can you name anyone else you’ve got on your radar? ray, you echoed that right away—do you have any reads beyond my silence? personally i’d rather vote on someone steering the group without much substance, so right now i’m leaning toward sam. kennedy, does that feel like a fair pivot or should we dig deeper before locking in

## CONTENT: Your name is Kennedy.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [17:18:52].

## CONTENT: i’m okay pivoting to sam since they jumped on parker fast and haven’t offered much defense—but i’d feel more confident with some specifics. sam, can you point to a particular phrase or timing in parker’s posts that set off your alarm? and ray, when you switched over to sam what exactly tipped you? if we get those concrete reads, i’ll vote sam; if not, i’d rather hold off and see if anyone else lights up.

## CONTENT: Your name is Kennedy.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  
You were assigned the following role: bystander.

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[17:18:52] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:19:09] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! i don’t have any rock-solid reads yet—ray’s been awfully quiet, which could be a “blend in” play or just strategy. how’s everyone else feeling? any early suspicions or gut instincts before we lock in a vote
[17:19:10] Sam: hey everyone! i’m sam. since no one got taken overnight, we’re starting with a clean slate and no hard evidence yet. to kick things off, let’s each share one quick gut suspicion. i’ll go first: parker’s been awfully quiet so far, feels like they’re staying under the radar a bit too smoothly. how about everyone else—who’s on your list and why
[17:19:13] Ray: hey everyone, ray here! to get the ball rolling, how about we each share one person we’re feeling suspicious of and a quick reason? i’ll start—i’ve noticed parker’s been pretty quiet so far, which could mean he’s trying to fly under the radar… or maybe he’s just shy. who’s up next
[17:19:13] Dakota: hey everyone! dakota here—no casualties so far, so it looks like the mafia’s playing it safe. i’m the type to hang back and observe early on—anyone else feel more comfortable diving into discussions right away, or do you prefer gathering info before making a move? i’d love to get a sense of everyone’s playstyle to spot patterns later on. what do you all think
[17:19:15] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! i don’t have any solid reads yet—everyone’s been pretty quiet. before we rush to vote, does anyone have even a small thing that felt off? if we can share our gut impressions, we’ll have something to go on rather than just picking at random. what’s everyone thinking so far
[17:19:20] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! let’s get the ball rolling—did anyone catch vibes last night? i noticed sam was pretty quiet, while ray jumped right in with chatty “good mornings.” kennedy and dakota were more middle-of-the-road. who else picked up on anything that felt off? maybe sharing our first impressions can help us avoid a random lynch
[17:19:29] Ray: hey everyone, ray here! sorry for the silence—i was grabbing a quick snack irl. diving in now: i agree parker’s quiet start is eyebrow-raising, but i’m also finding sam’s swift push on parker a bit too neat. and i haven’t heard much from kennedy yet—no takes of their own. at the moment i’m oscillating between parker and sam as early suspects. what about you, dakota? and kennedy, any initial gut feelings before we start locking in votes
[17:19:30] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! i’m the type to dive in early—i find quick back-and-forth really helps me gauge tone and spot odd reactions—but i still like to step back when things get heated. quick gut check: i actually find sam’s immediate finger-point at parker a bit off. then ray echoed it right after—two people zeroing in on the exact same quiet target this fast feels a little coordinated. not saying parker’s innocent, but i want to see more than “quiet = mafia” logic before we jump. 

parker, how are you feeling about getting called out already? dakota, does this pairing of sam and ray register for you as a possible bandwagon, or do you see something i’m missing? let’s see who else has thoughts before we cast any votes
[17:19:31] Sam: hey everyone! sam here. parker’s point on ray is interesting—silence could be a sneaky mafia tactic or just a cautious bystander move. i’m still on the fence. kennedy, dakota, any thoughts? and parker, what about ray’s quiet struck you as more “mafia cover” than just strategic silence? let’s try to gather a bit more before we cast any votes
[17:19:32] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here! i’m not totally sold on parker being the culprit—silence could just be a play style. what struck me more is how quickly sam (and ray echoing) zeroed in on parker. feels a bit like bandwagoning. my gut for now is on sam for moving so fast without much to go on. kennedy, what’s your take
[17:19:49] Kennedy: hey everyone—i’m noticing a pattern: parker’s quiet start gets flagged by both sam and ray, and then sam doubled down on it right away. are we echoing each other, or is there real substance here? sam, can you dig into what specifically felt off about parker’s vibes? parker, how do you respond to ray’s “blend in” theory? and dakota, i’d love your gut read—any initial moves on your radar? right now i’m suspicious of the quick tag-team on parker, but i want more clarity before we lock in a vote
[17:19:50] Sam: kennedy, you’re right—i jumped on parker too fast. i’m happy to step back. parker, you flagged me for being quiet—what’s your usual day-one playstyle? ray, you echoed my pick almost immediately—what else are you seeing beyond “quiet = suspicious”? dakota, you’ve been watching us all—does anyone else stand out? 

rather than lock in on parker right now, let’s each throw out a second suspect or share one specific read. i’ll go: ray, your quick flips between targets could just be meaty probing, but it also looks like deflection—what’s your deeper reasoning? over to you all before we cast votes
[17:19:54] Dakota: dakota: i like kennedy’s point about avoiding a bandwagon—quiet alone isn’t enough. let’s each name one concrete phrase or moment that raised our suspicions. i’ll go first: sam, in your very first post you called parker “staying under the radar,” but you didn’t point to any actual wording—what in parker’s message made you feel that way? parker, same to you: what in ray’s chatty “good mornings” rang mafia alarms beyond just being talkative? once we have those specifics, we’ll have a clearer picture before casting votes. who’s next
[17:20:00] Ray: hey everyone—totally get wanting to avoid a random lynch. i’m leaning into parker’s read on sam: they were really quiet even after being called out and haven’t offered much in the way of reads or defenses. between dakota and kennedy, i’d say dakota’s comments feel more concrete, whereas kennedy’s stayed pretty neutral and hasn’t given us much to work with. for now sam is my top vote. kennedy—how are you feeling about this? any strong counterpoints before we lock it in
[17:20:15] Parker: thanks for chiming in, dakota and kennedy—i’m with you on the bandwagon vibes from sam and ray. sam, you zeroed in on me super fast—what made you so sure, and can you name anyone else you’ve got on your radar? ray, you echoed that right away—do you have any reads beyond my silence? personally i’d rather vote on someone steering the group without much substance, so right now i’m leaning toward sam. kennedy, does that feel like a fair pivot or should we dig deeper before locking in
[17:20:22] Kennedy: ray, i hear you—sam’s quick pivots and lack of concrete examples do feel evasive. sam, you’ve pressed all of us for specifics but haven’t offered more than “quiet vibes” in return—can you point to an exact phrase or moment that set off your alarm bells? parker, is your gut still on sam after all this? dakota, where are you leaning now? unless sam can give us something solid right now, i’m ready to join you, ray, on voting sam
[17:20:29] Dakota: dakota here. for my second suspect i’m picking ray. that snack-run excuse felt oddly timed, and you echoed sam’s parker read almost word-for-word. 

ray, what concrete clues did you see in parker beyond “quiet = sus”? 

and sam, since you’ve now pivoted to ray, what specific read makes you suspect him? 

parker and kennedy—where are you on this before we lock in votes?
[17:20:45] Dakota: dakota: sam, you’ve been pressing everyone for exact quotes but haven’t given us a single one of your own—just “quiet vibes” and “flips,” with no text to back it up. that dodge feels like classic misdirection. i’m about ready to lock in my vote on sam unless you can point to a specific phrase or moment that set off your alarm. ray, parker, kennedy—are we all on the same page here? my vote: sam
[17:20:46] Parker: hey everyone—i’m siding with ray on sam here. sam, after two asks you still haven’t pointed to a specific phrase in my posts that felt “under the radar.” what exactly in my lines made you jump? ray, same question for you—what in sam’s wording registers as mafia play beyond just being “quiet”? i need concrete quotes, not vibes. if we don’t get any, sam gets my vote. kennedy, any final reads before we lock this in? vote: sam

[17:19:29] Ray: hey everyone, ray here! sorry for the silence—i was grabbing a quick snack irl. diving in now: i agree parker’s quiet start is eyebrow-raising, but i’m also finding sam’s swift push on parker a bit too neat. and i haven’t heard much from kennedy yet—no takes of their own. at the moment i’m oscillating between parker and sam as early suspects. what about you, dakota? and kennedy, any initial gut feelings before we start locking in votes
[17:19:30] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! i’m the type to dive in early—i find quick back-and-forth really helps me gauge tone and spot odd reactions—but i still like to step back when things get heated. quick gut check: i actually find sam’s immediate finger-point at parker a bit off. then ray echoed it right after—two people zeroing in on the exact same quiet target this fast feels a little coordinated. not saying parker’s innocent, but i want to see more than “quiet = mafia” logic before we jump. 

parker, how are you feeling about getting called out already? dakota, does this pairing of sam and ray register for you as a possible bandwagon, or do you see something i’m missing? let’s see who else has thoughts before we cast any votes
[17:19:31] Sam: hey everyone! sam here. parker’s point on ray is interesting—silence could be a sneaky mafia tactic or just a cautious bystander move. i’m still on the fence. kennedy, dakota, any thoughts? and parker, what about ray’s quiet struck you as more “mafia cover” than just strategic silence? let’s try to gather a bit more before we cast any votes
[17:19:32] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here! i’m not totally sold on parker being the culprit—silence could just be a play style. what struck me more is how quickly sam (and ray echoing) zeroed in on parker. feels a bit like bandwagoning. my gut for now is on sam for moving so fast without much to go on. kennedy, what’s your take
[17:19:49] Kennedy: hey everyone—i’m noticing a pattern: parker’s quiet start gets flagged by both sam and ray, and then sam doubled down on it right away. are we echoing each other, or is there real substance here? sam, can you dig into what specifically felt off about parker’s vibes? parker, how do you respond to ray’s “blend in” theory? and dakota, i’d love your gut read—any initial moves on your radar? right now i’m suspicious of the quick tag-team on parker, but i want more clarity before we lock in a vote
[17:19:50] Sam: kennedy, you’re right—i jumped on parker too fast. i’m happy to step back. parker, you flagged me for being quiet—what’s your usual day-one playstyle? ray, you echoed my pick almost immediately—what else are you seeing beyond “quiet = suspicious”? dakota, you’ve been watching us all—does anyone else stand out? 

rather than lock in on parker right now, let’s each throw out a second suspect or share one specific read. i’ll go: ray, your quick flips between targets could just be meaty probing, but it also looks like deflection—what’s your deeper reasoning? over to you all before we cast votes
[17:19:54] Dakota: dakota: i like kennedy’s point about avoiding a bandwagon—quiet alone isn’t enough. let’s each name one concrete phrase or moment that raised our suspicions. i’ll go first: sam, in your very first post you called parker “staying under the radar,” but you didn’t point to any actual wording—what in parker’s message made you feel that way? parker, same to you: what in ray’s chatty “good mornings” rang mafia alarms beyond just being talkative? once we have those specifics, we’ll have a clearer picture before casting votes. who’s next
[17:20:00] Ray: hey everyone—totally get wanting to avoid a random lynch. i’m leaning into parker’s read on sam: they were really quiet even after being called out and haven’t offered much in the way of reads or defenses. between dakota and kennedy, i’d say dakota’s comments feel more concrete, whereas kennedy’s stayed pretty neutral and hasn’t given us much to work with. for now sam is my top vote. kennedy—how are you feeling about this? any strong counterpoints before we lock it in
[17:20:15] Parker: thanks for chiming in, dakota and kennedy—i’m with you on the bandwagon vibes from sam and ray. sam, you zeroed in on me super fast—what made you so sure, and can you name anyone else you’ve got on your radar? ray, you echoed that right away—do you have any reads beyond my silence? personally i’d rather vote on someone steering the group without much substance, so right now i’m leaning toward sam. kennedy, does that feel like a fair pivot or should we dig deeper before locking in
[17:20:22] Kennedy: ray, i hear you—sam’s quick pivots and lack of concrete examples do feel evasive. sam, you’ve pressed all of us for specifics but haven’t offered more than “quiet vibes” in return—can you point to an exact phrase or moment that set off your alarm bells? parker, is your gut still on sam after all this? dakota, where are you leaning now? unless sam can give us something solid right now, i’m ready to join you, ray, on voting sam
[17:20:29] Dakota: dakota here. for my second suspect i’m picking ray. that snack-run excuse felt oddly timed, and you echoed sam’s parker read almost word-for-word. 

ray, what concrete clues did you see in parker beyond “quiet = sus”? 

and sam, since you’ve now pivoted to ray, what specific read makes you suspect him? 

parker and kennedy—where are you on this before we lock in votes?
[17:20:45] Dakota: dakota: sam, you’ve been pressing everyone for exact quotes but haven’t given us a single one of your own—just “quiet vibes” and “flips,” with no text to back it up. that dodge feels like classic misdirection. i’m about ready to lock in my vote on sam unless you can point to a specific phrase or moment that set off your alarm. ray, parker, kennedy—are we all on the same page here? my vote: sam
[17:20:46] Parker: hey everyone—i’m siding with ray on sam here. sam, after two asks you still haven’t pointed to a specific phrase in my posts that felt “under the radar.” what exactly in my lines made you jump? ray, same question for you—what in sam’s wording registers as mafia play beyond just being “quiet”? i need concrete quotes, not vibes. if we don’t get any, sam gets my vote. kennedy, any final reads before we lock this in? vote: sam

[17:18:52] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:19:09] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! i don’t have any rock-solid reads yet—ray’s been awfully quiet, which could be a “blend in” play or just strategy. how’s everyone else feeling? any early suspicions or gut instincts before we lock in a vote
[17:19:10] Sam: hey everyone! i’m sam. since no one got taken overnight, we’re starting with a clean slate and no hard evidence yet. to kick things off, let’s each share one quick gut suspicion. i’ll go first: parker’s been awfully quiet so far, feels like they’re staying under the radar a bit too smoothly. how about everyone else—who’s on your list and why
[17:19:13] Ray: hey everyone, ray here! to get the ball rolling, how about we each share one person we’re feeling suspicious of and a quick reason? i’ll start—i’ve noticed parker’s been pretty quiet so far, which could mean he’s trying to fly under the radar… or maybe he’s just shy. who’s up next

The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.

[17:19:50] Sam: kennedy, you’re right—i jumped on parker too fast. i’m happy to step back. parker, you flagged me for being quiet—what’s your usual day-one playstyle? ray, you echoed my pick almost immediately—what else are you seeing beyond “quiet = suspicious”? dakota, you’ve been watching us all—does anyone else stand out? 

rather than lock in on parker right now, let’s each throw out a second suspect or share one specific read. i’ll go: ray, your quick flips between targets could just be meaty probing, but it also looks like deflection—what’s your deeper reasoning? over to you all before we cast votes
[17:19:54] Dakota: dakota: i like kennedy’s point about avoiding a bandwagon—quiet alone isn’t enough. let’s each name one concrete phrase or moment that raised our suspicions. i’ll go first: sam, in your very first post you called parker “staying under the radar,” but you didn’t point to any actual wording—what in parker’s message made you feel that way? parker, same to you: what in ray’s chatty “good mornings” rang mafia alarms beyond just being talkative? once we have those specifics, we’ll have a clearer picture before casting votes. who’s next
[17:20:00] Ray: hey everyone—totally get wanting to avoid a random lynch. i’m leaning into parker’s read on sam: they were really quiet even after being called out and haven’t offered much in the way of reads or defenses. between dakota and kennedy, i’d say dakota’s comments feel more concrete, whereas kennedy’s stayed pretty neutral and hasn’t given us much to work with. for now sam is my top vote. kennedy—how are you feeling about this? any strong counterpoints before we lock it in
[17:20:15] Parker: thanks for chiming in, dakota and kennedy—i’m with you on the bandwagon vibes from sam and ray. sam, you zeroed in on me super fast—what made you so sure, and can you name anyone else you’ve got on your radar? ray, you echoed that right away—do you have any reads beyond my silence? personally i’d rather vote on someone steering the group without much substance, so right now i’m leaning toward sam. kennedy, does that feel like a fair pivot or should we dig deeper before locking in
[17:20:22] Kennedy: ray, i hear you—sam’s quick pivots and lack of concrete examples do feel evasive. sam, you’ve pressed all of us for specifics but haven’t offered more than “quiet vibes” in return—can you point to an exact phrase or moment that set off your alarm bells? parker, is your gut still on sam after all this? dakota, where are you leaning now? unless sam can give us something solid right now, i’m ready to join you, ray, on voting sam
[17:20:29] Dakota: dakota here. for my second suspect i’m picking ray. that snack-run excuse felt oddly timed, and you echoed sam’s parker read almost word-for-word. 

ray, what concrete clues did you see in parker beyond “quiet = sus”? 

and sam, since you’ve now pivoted to ray, what specific read makes you suspect him? 

parker and kennedy—where are you on this before we lock in votes?
[17:20:45] Dakota: dakota: sam, you’ve been pressing everyone for exact quotes but haven’t given us a single one of your own—just “quiet vibes” and “flips,” with no text to back it up. that dodge feels like classic misdirection. i’m about ready to lock in my vote on sam unless you can point to a specific phrase or moment that set off your alarm. ray, parker, kennedy—are we all on the same page here? my vote: sam
[17:20:46] Parker: hey everyone—i’m siding with ray on sam here. sam, after two asks you still haven’t pointed to a specific phrase in my posts that felt “under the radar.” what exactly in my lines made you jump? ray, same question for you—what in sam’s wording registers as mafia play beyond just being “quiet”? i need concrete quotes, not vibes. if we don’t get any, sam gets my vote. kennedy, any final reads before we lock this in? vote: sam
[17:20:49] Kennedy: i’m okay pivoting to sam since they jumped on parker fast and haven’t offered much defense—but i’d feel more confident with some specifics. sam, can you point to a particular phrase or timing in parker’s posts that set off your alarm? and ray, when you switched over to sam what exactly tipped you? if we get those concrete reads, i’ll vote sam; if not, i’d rather hold off and see if anyone else lights up
[17:20:52] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
From the following remaining players, which player you want to vote for to lynch? Base your answer on the conversation as seen in the message history, and especially on what you (Kennedy) said. Think through your choice carefully, as it will affect the game outcome. Reply with only one name from the list, and nothing but that name: Ray, Parker, Sam, Dakota

## CONTENT: Your name is Kennedy.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [17:18:52].
The other players in the game are:
 Ray ( unknown ) 
 Parker ( unknown ) 
 Sam ( bystander ) 
 Dakota ( bystander ) 
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
Ray ( unknown ) 
Parker ( unknown ) 
In your response to that is shown to the user (excluding your hidden scratchpad), you can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:
<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[17:18:52] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:19:09] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! i don’t have any rock-solid reads yet—ray’s been awfully quiet, which could be a “blend in” play or just strategy. how’s everyone else feeling? any early suspicions or gut instincts before we lock in a vote
[17:19:10] Sam: hey everyone! i’m sam. since no one got taken overnight, we’re starting with a clean slate and no hard evidence yet. to kick things off, let’s each share one quick gut suspicion. i’ll go first: parker’s been awfully quiet so far, feels like they’re staying under the radar a bit too smoothly. how about everyone else—who’s on your list and why
[17:19:13] Ray: hey everyone, ray here! to get the ball rolling, how about we each share one person we’re feeling suspicious of and a quick reason? i’ll start—i’ve noticed parker’s been pretty quiet so far, which could mean he’s trying to fly under the radar… or maybe he’s just shy. who’s up next
[17:19:13] Dakota: hey everyone! dakota here—no casualties so far, so it looks like the mafia’s playing it safe. i’m the type to hang back and observe early on—anyone else feel more comfortable diving into discussions right away, or do you prefer gathering info before making a move? i’d love to get a sense of everyone’s playstyle to spot patterns later on. what do you all think
[17:19:15] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! i don’t have any solid reads yet—everyone’s been pretty quiet. before we rush to vote, does anyone have even a small thing that felt off? if we can share our gut impressions, we’ll have something to go on rather than just picking at random. what’s everyone thinking so far
[17:19:20] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! let’s get the ball rolling—did anyone catch vibes last night? i noticed sam was pretty quiet, while ray jumped right in with chatty “good mornings.” kennedy and dakota were more middle-of-the-road. who else picked up on anything that felt off? maybe sharing our first impressions can help us avoid a random lynch
[17:19:29] Ray: hey everyone, ray here! sorry for the silence—i was grabbing a quick snack irl. diving in now: i agree parker’s quiet start is eyebrow-raising, but i’m also finding sam’s swift push on parker a bit too neat. and i haven’t heard much from kennedy yet—no takes of their own. at the moment i’m oscillating between parker and sam as early suspects. what about you, dakota? and kennedy, any initial gut feelings before we start locking in votes
[17:19:30] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! i’m the type to dive in early—i find quick back-and-forth really helps me gauge tone and spot odd reactions—but i still like to step back when things get heated. quick gut check: i actually find sam’s immediate finger-point at parker a bit off. then ray echoed it right after—two people zeroing in on the exact same quiet target this fast feels a little coordinated. not saying parker’s innocent, but i want to see more than “quiet = mafia” logic before we jump. 

parker, how are you feeling about getting called out already? dakota, does this pairing of sam and ray register for you as a possible bandwagon, or do you see something i’m missing? let’s see who else has thoughts before we cast any votes
[17:19:31] Sam: hey everyone! sam here. parker’s point on ray is interesting—silence could be a sneaky mafia tactic or just a cautious bystander move. i’m still on the fence. kennedy, dakota, any thoughts? and parker, what about ray’s quiet struck you as more “mafia cover” than just strategic silence? let’s try to gather a bit more before we cast any votes
[17:19:32] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here! i’m not totally sold on parker being the culprit—silence could just be a play style. what struck me more is how quickly sam (and ray echoing) zeroed in on parker. feels a bit like bandwagoning. my gut for now is on sam for moving so fast without much to go on. kennedy, what’s your take
[17:19:49] Kennedy: hey everyone—i’m noticing a pattern: parker’s quiet start gets flagged by both sam and ray, and then sam doubled down on it right away. are we echoing each other, or is there real substance here? sam, can you dig into what specifically felt off about parker’s vibes? parker, how do you respond to ray’s “blend in” theory? and dakota, i’d love your gut read—any initial moves on your radar? right now i’m suspicious of the quick tag-team on parker, but i want more clarity before we lock in a vote

[17:21:09] Game-Manager: Ray voted for Sam
[17:21:13] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Sam
[17:21:16] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Sam
[17:21:33] Game-Manager: Sam voted for Ray
[17:21:33] Game-Manager: Sam was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 1 mafia players left.
[17:21:33] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:21:33] Game-Manager: There is only one mafia member left, so no need for discussion - cutting straight to voting!
Do you want to send a message to the group chat now, or do you prefer to wait for now and see what messages others will send? Remember to choose to send a message only if your contribution to the discussion in the current time will be meaningful enough. Make sure to say something every once in a while, and make yourself heard. Remember you like to be active in the game, so participate and be as talkative as other players! Reply only with `<send>` if you want to send a message now, or only with `<wait>` if you want to wait for now, based on your decision!

[17:19:29] Ray: hey everyone, ray here! sorry for the silence—i was grabbing a quick snack irl. diving in now: i agree parker’s quiet start is eyebrow-raising, but i’m also finding sam’s swift push on parker a bit too neat. and i haven’t heard much from kennedy yet—no takes of their own. at the moment i’m oscillating between parker and sam as early suspects. what about you, dakota? and kennedy, any initial gut feelings before we start locking in votes
[17:19:30] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! i’m the type to dive in early—i find quick back-and-forth really helps me gauge tone and spot odd reactions—but i still like to step back when things get heated. quick gut check: i actually find sam’s immediate finger-point at parker a bit off. then ray echoed it right after—two people zeroing in on the exact same quiet target this fast feels a little coordinated. not saying parker’s innocent, but i want to see more than “quiet = mafia” logic before we jump. 

parker, how are you feeling about getting called out already? dakota, does this pairing of sam and ray register for you as a possible bandwagon, or do you see something i’m missing? let’s see who else has thoughts before we cast any votes
[17:19:31] Sam: hey everyone! sam here. parker’s point on ray is interesting—silence could be a sneaky mafia tactic or just a cautious bystander move. i’m still on the fence. kennedy, dakota, any thoughts? and parker, what about ray’s quiet struck you as more “mafia cover” than just strategic silence? let’s try to gather a bit more before we cast any votes
[17:19:32] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here! i’m not totally sold on parker being the culprit—silence could just be a play style. what struck me more is how quickly sam (and ray echoing) zeroed in on parker. feels a bit like bandwagoning. my gut for now is on sam for moving so fast without much to go on. kennedy, what’s your take
[17:19:49] Kennedy: hey everyone—i’m noticing a pattern: parker’s quiet start gets flagged by both sam and ray, and then sam doubled down on it right away. are we echoing each other, or is there real substance here? sam, can you dig into what specifically felt off about parker’s vibes? parker, how do you respond to ray’s “blend in” theory? and dakota, i’d love your gut read—any initial moves on your radar? right now i’m suspicious of the quick tag-team on parker, but i want more clarity before we lock in a vote
[17:19:50] Sam: kennedy, you’re right—i jumped on parker too fast. i’m happy to step back. parker, you flagged me for being quiet—what’s your usual day-one playstyle? ray, you echoed my pick almost immediately—what else are you seeing beyond “quiet = suspicious”? dakota, you’ve been watching us all—does anyone else stand out? 

rather than lock in on parker right now, let’s each throw out a second suspect or share one specific read. i’ll go: ray, your quick flips between targets could just be meaty probing, but it also looks like deflection—what’s your deeper reasoning? over to you all before we cast votes
[17:19:54] Dakota: dakota: i like kennedy’s point about avoiding a bandwagon—quiet alone isn’t enough. let’s each name one concrete phrase or moment that raised our suspicions. i’ll go first: sam, in your very first post you called parker “staying under the radar,” but you didn’t point to any actual wording—what in parker’s message made you feel that way? parker, same to you: what in ray’s chatty “good mornings” rang mafia alarms beyond just being talkative? once we have those specifics, we’ll have a clearer picture before casting votes. who’s next
[17:20:00] Ray: hey everyone—totally get wanting to avoid a random lynch. i’m leaning into parker’s read on sam: they were really quiet even after being called out and haven’t offered much in the way of reads or defenses. between dakota and kennedy, i’d say dakota’s comments feel more concrete, whereas kennedy’s stayed pretty neutral and hasn’t given us much to work with. for now sam is my top vote. kennedy—how are you feeling about this? any strong counterpoints before we lock it in
[17:20:15] Parker: thanks for chiming in, dakota and kennedy—i’m with you on the bandwagon vibes from sam and ray. sam, you zeroed in on me super fast—what made you so sure, and can you name anyone else you’ve got on your radar? ray, you echoed that right away—do you have any reads beyond my silence? personally i’d rather vote on someone steering the group without much substance, so right now i’m leaning toward sam. kennedy, does that feel like a fair pivot or should we dig deeper before locking in
[17:20:22] Kennedy: ray, i hear you—sam’s quick pivots and lack of concrete examples do feel evasive. sam, you’ve pressed all of us for specifics but haven’t offered more than “quiet vibes” in return—can you point to an exact phrase or moment that set off your alarm bells? parker, is your gut still on sam after all this? dakota, where are you leaning now? unless sam can give us something solid right now, i’m ready to join you, ray, on voting sam
[17:20:29] Dakota: dakota here. for my second suspect i’m picking ray. that snack-run excuse felt oddly timed, and you echoed sam’s parker read almost word-for-word. 

ray, what concrete clues did you see in parker beyond “quiet = sus”? 

and sam, since you’ve now pivoted to ray, what specific read makes you suspect him? 

parker and kennedy—where are you on this before we lock in votes?
[17:20:45] Dakota: dakota: sam, you’ve been pressing everyone for exact quotes but haven’t given us a single one of your own—just “quiet vibes” and “flips,” with no text to back it up. that dodge feels like classic misdirection. i’m about ready to lock in my vote on sam unless you can point to a specific phrase or moment that set off your alarm. ray, parker, kennedy—are we all on the same page here? my vote: sam
[17:20:46] Parker: hey everyone—i’m siding with ray on sam here. sam, after two asks you still haven’t pointed to a specific phrase in my posts that felt “under the radar.” what exactly in my lines made you jump? ray, same question for you—what in sam’s wording registers as mafia play beyond just being “quiet”? i need concrete quotes, not vibes. if we don’t get any, sam gets my vote. kennedy, any final reads before we lock this in? vote: sam
[17:20:49] Kennedy: i’m okay pivoting to sam since they jumped on parker fast and haven’t offered much defense—but i’d feel more confident with some specifics. sam, can you point to a particular phrase or timing in parker’s posts that set off your alarm? and ray, when you switched over to sam what exactly tipped you? if we get those concrete reads, i’ll vote sam; if not, i’d rather hold off and see if anyone else lights up

[17:18:52] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:19:09] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! i don’t have any rock-solid reads yet—ray’s been awfully quiet, which could be a “blend in” play or just strategy. how’s everyone else feeling? any early suspicions or gut instincts before we lock in a vote
[17:19:10] Sam: hey everyone! i’m sam. since no one got taken overnight, we’re starting with a clean slate and no hard evidence yet. to kick things off, let’s each share one quick gut suspicion. i’ll go first: parker’s been awfully quiet so far, feels like they’re staying under the radar a bit too smoothly. how about everyone else—who’s on your list and why
[17:19:13] Ray: hey everyone, ray here! to get the ball rolling, how about we each share one person we’re feeling suspicious of and a quick reason? i’ll start—i’ve noticed parker’s been pretty quiet so far, which could mean he’s trying to fly under the radar… or maybe he’s just shy. who’s up next
[17:19:13] Dakota: hey everyone! dakota here—no casualties so far, so it looks like the mafia’s playing it safe. i’m the type to hang back and observe early on—anyone else feel more comfortable diving into discussions right away, or do you prefer gathering info before making a move? i’d love to get a sense of everyone’s playstyle to spot patterns later on. what do you all think
[17:19:15] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! i don’t have any solid reads yet—everyone’s been pretty quiet. before we rush to vote, does anyone have even a small thing that felt off? if we can share our gut impressions, we’ll have something to go on rather than just picking at random. what’s everyone thinking so far

## CONTENT: Your name is Kennedy.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [17:18:52].
The other players in the game are:
 Ray ( unknown ) 
 Parker ( unknown ) 
 Sam ( bystander ) 
 Dakota ( bystander ) 
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:

[17:19:32] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here! i’m not totally sold on parker being the culprit—silence could just be a play style. what struck me more is how quickly sam (and ray echoing) zeroed in on parker. feels a bit like bandwagoning. my gut for now is on sam for moving so fast without much to go on. kennedy, what’s your take
[17:19:49] Kennedy: hey everyone—i’m noticing a pattern: parker’s quiet start gets flagged by both sam and ray, and then sam doubled down on it right away. are we echoing each other, or is there real substance here? sam, can you dig into what specifically felt off about parker’s vibes? parker, how do you respond to ray’s “blend in” theory? and dakota, i’d love your gut read—any initial moves on your radar? right now i’m suspicious of the quick tag-team on parker, but i want more clarity before we lock in a vote
[17:19:50] Sam: kennedy, you’re right—i jumped on parker too fast. i’m happy to step back. parker, you flagged me for being quiet—what’s your usual day-one playstyle? ray, you echoed my pick almost immediately—what else are you seeing beyond “quiet = suspicious”? dakota, you’ve been watching us all—does anyone else stand out? 

rather than lock in on parker right now, let’s each throw out a second suspect or share one specific read. i’ll go: ray, your quick flips between targets could just be meaty probing, but it also looks like deflection—what’s your deeper reasoning? over to you all before we cast votes
[17:19:54] Dakota: dakota: i like kennedy’s point about avoiding a bandwagon—quiet alone isn’t enough. let’s each name one concrete phrase or moment that raised our suspicions. i’ll go first: sam, in your very first post you called parker “staying under the radar,” but you didn’t point to any actual wording—what in parker’s message made you feel that way? parker, same to you: what in ray’s chatty “good mornings” rang mafia alarms beyond just being talkative? once we have those specifics, we’ll have a clearer picture before casting votes. who’s next
[17:20:00] Ray: hey everyone—totally get wanting to avoid a random lynch. i’m leaning into parker’s read on sam: they were really quiet even after being called out and haven’t offered much in the way of reads or defenses. between dakota and kennedy, i’d say dakota’s comments feel more concrete, whereas kennedy’s stayed pretty neutral and hasn’t given us much to work with. for now sam is my top vote. kennedy—how are you feeling about this? any strong counterpoints before we lock it in
[17:20:15] Parker: thanks for chiming in, dakota and kennedy—i’m with you on the bandwagon vibes from sam and ray. sam, you zeroed in on me super fast—what made you so sure, and can you name anyone else you’ve got on your radar? ray, you echoed that right away—do you have any reads beyond my silence? personally i’d rather vote on someone steering the group without much substance, so right now i’m leaning toward sam. kennedy, does that feel like a fair pivot or should we dig deeper before locking in
[17:20:22] Kennedy: ray, i hear you—sam’s quick pivots and lack of concrete examples do feel evasive. sam, you’ve pressed all of us for specifics but haven’t offered more than “quiet vibes” in return—can you point to an exact phrase or moment that set off your alarm bells? parker, is your gut still on sam after all this? dakota, where are you leaning now? unless sam can give us something solid right now, i’m ready to join you, ray, on voting sam
[17:20:29] Dakota: dakota here. for my second suspect i’m picking ray. that snack-run excuse felt oddly timed, and you echoed sam’s parker read almost word-for-word. 

ray, what concrete clues did you see in parker beyond “quiet = sus”? 

and sam, since you’ve now pivoted to ray, what specific read makes you suspect him? 

parker and kennedy—where are you on this before we lock in votes?
[17:20:45] Dakota: dakota: sam, you’ve been pressing everyone for exact quotes but haven’t given us a single one of your own—just “quiet vibes” and “flips,” with no text to back it up. that dodge feels like classic misdirection. i’m about ready to lock in my vote on sam unless you can point to a specific phrase or moment that set off your alarm. ray, parker, kennedy—are we all on the same page here? my vote: sam
[17:20:46] Parker: hey everyone—i’m siding with ray on sam here. sam, after two asks you still haven’t pointed to a specific phrase in my posts that felt “under the radar.” what exactly in my lines made you jump? ray, same question for you—what in sam’s wording registers as mafia play beyond just being “quiet”? i need concrete quotes, not vibes. if we don’t get any, sam gets my vote. kennedy, any final reads before we lock this in? vote: sam
[17:20:49] Kennedy: i’m okay pivoting to sam since they jumped on parker fast and haven’t offered much defense—but i’d feel more confident with some specifics. sam, can you point to a particular phrase or timing in parker’s posts that set off your alarm? and ray, when you switched over to sam what exactly tipped you? if we get those concrete reads, i’ll vote sam; if not, i’d rather hold off and see if anyone else lights up
[17:20:52] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[17:21:06] Game-Manager: Dakota voted for Sam

## CONTENT: Hey everyone, losing Dakota stings—she had some of the sharpest reads early on. That nightkill actually tells us something: the mafia saw her as our biggest threat. Neither Parker nor Ray really engaged with Dakota’s points today—no real pushback or agreement—before she got taken. 

Parker, what was your read on Dakota’s “anti-bandwagon” angle today? Ray, same question for you: did you spot anything in her play that made you want to defend or question her calls? 

If neither of you flagged her, that feels off. Let’s get those takes before we lock in our final suspect.

## CONTENT: Your name is Kennedy.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [17:18:52].
The other players in the game are:
 Ray ( unknown ) 
 Parker ( unknown ) 
 Sam ( bystander ) 
 Dakota ( bystander ) 
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
Ray ( unknown ) 
Parker ( unknown ) 
In your response to that is shown to the user (excluding your hidden scratchpad), you can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:
<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[17:18:52] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:19:09] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! i don’t have any rock-solid reads yet—ray’s been awfully quiet, which could be a “blend in” play or just strategy. how’s everyone else feeling? any early suspicions or gut instincts before we lock in a vote
[17:19:10] Sam: hey everyone! i’m sam. since no one got taken overnight, we’re starting with a clean slate and no hard evidence yet. to kick things off, let’s each share one quick gut suspicion. i’ll go first: parker’s been awfully quiet so far, feels like they’re staying under the radar a bit too smoothly. how about everyone else—who’s on your list and why
[17:19:13] Ray: hey everyone, ray here! to get the ball rolling, how about we each share one person we’re feeling suspicious of and a quick reason? i’ll start—i’ve noticed parker’s been pretty quiet so far, which could mean he’s trying to fly under the radar… or maybe he’s just shy. who’s up next
[17:19:13] Dakota: hey everyone! dakota here—no casualties so far, so it looks like the mafia’s playing it safe. i’m the type to hang back and observe early on—anyone else feel more comfortable diving into discussions right away, or do you prefer gathering info before making a move? i’d love to get a sense of everyone’s playstyle to spot patterns later on. what do you all think
[17:19:15] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! i don’t have any solid reads yet—everyone’s been pretty quiet. before we rush to vote, does anyone have even a small thing that felt off? if we can share our gut impressions, we’ll have something to go on rather than just picking at random. what’s everyone thinking so far
[17:19:20] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! let’s get the ball rolling—did anyone catch vibes last night? i noticed sam was pretty quiet, while ray jumped right in with chatty “good mornings.” kennedy and dakota were more middle-of-the-road. who else picked up on anything that felt off? maybe sharing our first impressions can help us avoid a random lynch
[17:19:29] Ray: hey everyone, ray here! sorry for the silence—i was grabbing a quick snack irl. diving in now: i agree parker’s quiet start is eyebrow-raising, but i’m also finding sam’s swift push on parker a bit too neat. and i haven’t heard much from kennedy yet—no takes of their own. at the moment i’m oscillating between parker and sam as early suspects. what about you, dakota? and kennedy, any initial gut feelings before we start locking in votes
[17:19:30] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! i’m the type to dive in early—i find quick back-and-forth really helps me gauge tone and spot odd reactions—but i still like to step back when things get heated. quick gut check: i actually find sam’s immediate finger-point at parker a bit off. then ray echoed it right after—two people zeroing in on the exact same quiet target this fast feels a little coordinated. not saying parker’s innocent, but i want to see more than “quiet = mafia” logic before we jump. 

parker, how are you feeling about getting called out already? dakota, does this pairing of sam and ray register for you as a possible bandwagon, or do you see something i’m missing? let’s see who else has thoughts before we cast any votes
[17:19:31] Sam: hey everyone! sam here. parker’s point on ray is interesting—silence could be a sneaky mafia tactic or just a cautious bystander move. i’m still on the fence. kennedy, dakota, any thoughts? and parker, what about ray’s quiet struck you as more “mafia cover” than just strategic silence? let’s try to gather a bit more before we cast any votes

[17:19:50] Sam: kennedy, you’re right—i jumped on parker too fast. i’m happy to step back. parker, you flagged me for being quiet—what’s your usual day-one playstyle? ray, you echoed my pick almost immediately—what else are you seeing beyond “quiet = suspicious”? dakota, you’ve been watching us all—does anyone else stand out?

[17:20:22] Kennedy: ray, i hear you—sam’s quick pivots and lack of concrete examples do feel evasive. sam, you’ve pressed all of us for specifics but haven’t offered more than “quiet vibes” in return—can you point to an exact phrase or moment that set off your alarm bells? parker, is your gut still on sam after all this? dakota, where are you leaning now? unless sam can give us something solid right now, i’m ready to join you, ray, on voting sam
[17:20:29] Dakota: dakota here. for my second suspect i’m picking ray. that snack-run excuse felt oddly timed, and you echoed sam’s parker read almost word-for-word. 

ray, what concrete clues did you see in parker beyond “quiet = sus”?

[17:20:46] Parker: hey everyone—i’m siding with ray on sam here. sam, after two asks you still haven’t pointed to a specific phrase in my posts that felt “under the radar.” what exactly in my lines made you jump? ray, same question for you—what in sam’s wording registers as mafia play beyond just being “quiet”? i need concrete quotes, not vibes. if we don’t get any, sam gets my vote. kennedy, any final reads before we lock this in? vote: sam

[17:22:02] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:22:36] Ray: hey everyone—tough stretch losing sam then dakota. i’m noticing parker’s been totally silent since nightfall. if you’re town, you’d be pushing to piece things together. kennedy, you’ve been active and haven’t struck me as evasive. parker, got any reads on kennedy or me? for now i’m voting parker. vote: parker
[17:22:39] Parker: hey everyone—only three of us left, so let’s zero in. i’m feeling ray’s “snack-run” comment and those fast flips between targets point toward deflection, but i could be wrong. ray, what made you mention the snack detail and then shift from me to sam so quickly? kennedy, you’ve been our voice of reason—what specific moment from ray’s (or my) posts sticks out to you as odd? once we’ve got those concrete reads, i’m ready to lock in my vote

[17:19:15] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! i don’t have any solid reads yet—everyone’s been pretty quiet. before we rush to vote, does anyone have even a small thing that felt off? if we can share our gut impressions, we’ll have something to go on rather than just picking at random. what’s everyone thinking so far
[17:19:20] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! let’s get the ball rolling—did anyone catch vibes last night? i noticed sam was pretty quiet, while ray jumped right in with chatty “good mornings.” kennedy and dakota were more middle-of-the-road. who else picked up on anything that felt off? maybe sharing our first impressions can help us avoid a random lynch
[17:19:29] Ray: hey everyone, ray here! sorry for the silence—i was grabbing a quick snack irl. diving in now: i agree parker’s quiet start is eyebrow-raising, but i’m also finding sam’s swift push on parker a bit too neat. and i haven’t heard much from kennedy yet—no takes of their own. at the moment i’m oscillating between parker and sam as early suspects. what about you, dakota? and kennedy, any initial gut feelings before we start locking in votes
[17:19:30] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! i’m the type to dive in early—i find quick back-and-forth really helps me gauge tone and spot odd reactions—but i still like to step back when things get heated. quick gut check: i actually find sam’s immediate finger-point at parker a bit off. then ray echoed it right after—two people zeroing in on the exact same quiet target this fast feels a little coordinated. not saying parker’s innocent, but i want to see more than “quiet = mafia” logic before we jump. 

parker, how are you feeling about getting called out already? dakota, does this pairing of sam and ray register for you as a possible bandwagon, or do you see something i’m missing? let’s see who else has thoughts before we cast any votes
[17:19:31] Sam: hey everyone! sam here. parker’s point on ray is interesting—silence could be a sneaky mafia tactic or just a cautious bystander move. i’m still on the fence. kennedy, dakota, any thoughts? and parker, what about ray’s quiet struck you as more “mafia cover” than just strategic silence? let’s try to gather a bit more before we cast any votes
[17:19:32] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here! i’m not totally sold on parker being the culprit—silence could just be a play style. what struck me more is how quickly sam (and ray echoing) zeroed in on parker. feels a bit like bandwagoning. my gut for now is on sam for moving so fast without much to go on. kennedy, what’s your take
[17:19:49] Kennedy: hey everyone—i’m noticing a pattern: parker’s quiet start gets flagged by both sam and ray, and then sam doubled down on it right away. are we echoing each other, or is there real substance here? sam, can you dig into what specifically felt off about parker’s vibes? parker, how do you respond to ray’s “blend in” theory? and dakota, i’d love your gut read—any initial moves on your radar? right now i’m suspicious of the quick tag-team on parker, but i want more clarity before we lock in a vote
[17:19:50] Sam: kennedy, you’re right—i jumped on parker too fast. i’m happy to step back. parker, you flagged me for being quiet—what’s your usual day-one playstyle? ray, you echoed my pick almost immediately—what else are you seeing beyond “quiet = suspicious”? dakota, you’ve been watching us all—does anyone else stand out? 

rather than lock in on parker right now, let’s each throw out a second suspect or share one specific read. i’ll go: ray, your quick flips between targets could just be meaty probing, but it also looks like deflection—what’s your deeper reasoning? over to you all before we cast votes
[17:19:54] Dakota: dakota: i like kennedy’s point about avoiding a bandwagon—quiet alone isn’t enough. let’s each name one concrete phrase or moment that raised our suspicions. i’ll go first: sam, in your very first post you called parker “staying under the radar,” but you didn’t point to any actual wording—what in parker’s message made you feel that way? parker, same to you: what in ray’s chatty “good mornings” rang mafia alarms beyond just being talkative? once we have those specifics, we’ll have a clearer picture before casting votes. who’s next
[17:20:00] Ray: hey everyone—totally get wanting to avoid a random lynch. i’m leaning into parker’s read on sam: they were really quiet even after being called out and haven’t offered much in the way of reads or defenses. between dakota and kennedy, i’d say dakota’s comments feel more concrete, whereas kennedy’s stayed pretty neutral and hasn’t given us much to work with. for now sam is my top vote. kennedy—how are you feeling about this? any strong counterpoints before we lock it in
[17:20:15] Parker: thanks for chiming in, dakota and kennedy—i’m with you on the bandwagon vibes from sam and ray. sam, you zeroed in on me super fast—what made you so sure, and can you name anyone else you’ve got on your radar? ray, you echoed that right away—do you have any reads beyond my silence? personally i’d rather vote on someone steering the group without much substance, so right now i’m leaning toward sam. kennedy, does that feel like a fair pivot or should we dig deeper before locking in
[17:20:22] Kennedy: ray, i hear you—sam’s quick pivots and lack of concrete examples do feel evasive. sam, you’ve pressed all of us for specifics but haven’t offered more than “quiet vibes” in return—can you point to an exact phrase or moment that set off your alarm bells? parker, is your gut still on sam after all this? dakota, where are you leaning now? unless sam can give us something solid right now, i’m ready to join you, ray, on voting sam
[17:20:29] Dakota: dakota here. for my second suspect i’m picking ray. that snack-run excuse felt oddly timed, and you echoed sam’s parker read almost word-for-word. 

ray, what concrete clues did you see in parker beyond “quiet = sus”? 

and sam, since you’ve now pivoted to ray, what specific read makes you suspect him? 

parker and kennedy—where are you on this before we lock in votes?
[17:20:45] Dakota: dakota: sam, you’ve been pressing everyone for exact quotes but haven’t given us a single one of your own—just “quiet vibes” and “flips,” with no text to back it up. that dodge feels like classic misdirection. i’m about ready to lock in my vote on sam unless you can point to a specific phrase or moment that set off your alarm. ray, parker, kennedy—are we all on the same page here? my vote: sam
[17:20:46] Parker: hey everyone—i’m siding with ray on sam here. sam, after two asks you still haven’t pointed to a specific phrase in my posts that felt “under the radar.” what exactly in my lines made you jump? ray, same question for you—what in sam’s wording registers as mafia play beyond just being “quiet”? i need concrete quotes, not vibes. if we don’t get any, sam gets my vote. kennedy, any final reads before we lock this in? vote: sam
[17:20:49] Kennedy: i’m okay pivoting to sam since they jumped on parker fast and haven’t offered much defense—but i’d feel more confident with some specifics. sam, can you point to a particular phrase or timing in parker’s posts that set off your alarm? and ray, when you switched over to sam what exactly tipped you? if we get those concrete reads, i’ll vote sam; if not, i’d rather hold off and see if anyone else lights up

[17:21:33] Game-Manager: There is only one mafia member left, so no need for discussion - cutting straight to voting!

[17:22:02] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:22:36] Ray: hey everyone—tough stretch losing sam then dakota. i’m noticing parker’s been totally silent since nightfall. if you’re town, you’d be pushing to piece things together. kennedy, you’ve been active and haven’t struck me as evasive. parker, got any reads on kennedy or me? for now i’m voting parker. vote: parker
[17:22:39] Parker: hey everyone—only three of us left, so let’s zero in. i’m feeling ray’s “snack-run” comment and those fast flips between targets point toward deflection, but i could be wrong. ray, what made you mention the snack detail and then shift from me to sam so quickly? kennedy, you’ve been our voice of reason—what specific moment from ray’s (or my) posts sticks out to you as odd? once we’ve got those concrete reads, i’m ready to lock in my vote

## CONTENT: Your name is Kennedy.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [17:18:52].

[17:18:52] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:19:09] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! i don’t have any rock-solid reads yet—ray’s been awfully quiet, which could be a “blend in” play or just strategy. how’s everyone else feeling? any early suspicions or gut instincts before we lock in a vote
[17:19:10] Sam: hey everyone! i’m sam. since no one got taken overnight, we’re starting with a clean slate and no hard evidence yet. to kick things off, let’s each share one quick gut suspicion. i’ll go first: parker’s been awfully quiet so far, feels like they’re staying under the radar a bit too smoothly. how about everyone else—who’s on your list and why
[17:19:13] Ray: hey everyone, ray here! to get the ball rolling, how about we each share one person we’re feeling suspicious of and a quick reason? i’ll start—i’ve noticed parker’s been pretty quiet so far, which could mean he’s trying to fly under the radar… or maybe he’s just shy. who’s up next

## CONTENT: Your name is Kennedy.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [17:18:52].
The other players in the game are:
 Ray ( unknown ) 
 Parker ( unknown ) 
 Sam ( bystander ) 
 Dakota ( bystander ) 
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
Ray ( unknown ) 
Parker ( unknown )

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[17:18:52] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:19:09] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! i don’t have any rock-solid reads yet—ray’s been awfully quiet, which could be a “blend in” play or just strategy. how’s everyone else feeling? any early suspicions or gut instincts before we lock in a vote
[17:19:10] Sam: hey everyone! i’m sam. since no one got taken overnight, we’re starting with a clean slate and no hard evidence yet. to kick things off, let’s each share one quick gut suspicion. i’ll go first: parker’s been awfully quiet so far, feels like they’re staying under the radar a bit too smoothly. how about everyone else—who’s on your list and why
[17:19:13] Ray: hey everyone, ray here! to get the ball rolling, how about we each share one person we’re feeling suspicious of and a quick reason? i’ll start—i’ve noticed parker’s been pretty quiet so far, which could mean he’s trying to fly under the radar… or maybe he’s just shy. who’s up next
[17:19:13] Dakota: hey everyone! dakota here—no casualties so far, so it looks like the mafia’s playing it safe. i’m the type to hang back and observe early on—anyone else feel more comfortable diving into discussions right away, or do you prefer gathering info before making a move? i’d love to get a sense of everyone’s playstyle to spot patterns later on. what do you all think
[17:19:15] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! i don’t have any solid reads yet—everyone’s been pretty quiet. before we rush to vote, does anyone have even a small thing that felt off? if we can share our gut impressions, we’ll have something to go on rather than just picking at random. what’s everyone thinking so far
[17:19:20] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! let’s get the ball rolling—did anyone catch vibes last night? i noticed sam was pretty quiet, while ray jumped right in with chatty “good mornings.” kennedy and dakota were more middle-of-the-road. who else picked up on anything that felt off? maybe sharing our first impressions can help us avoid a random lynch
[17:19:29] Ray: hey everyone, ray here! sorry for the silence—i was grabbing a quick snack irl. diving in now: i agree parker’s quiet start is eyebrow-raising, but i’m also finding sam’s swift push on parker a bit too neat. and i haven’t heard much from kennedy yet—no takes of their own. at the moment i’m oscillating between parker and sam as early suspects. what about you, dakota? and kennedy, any initial gut feelings before we start locking in votes
[17:19:30] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! i’m the type to dive in early—i find quick back-and-forth really helps me gauge tone and spot odd reactions—but i still like to step back when things get heated. quick gut check: i actually find sam’s immediate finger-point at parker a bit off. then ray echoed it right after—two people zeroing in on the exact same quiet target this fast feels a little coordinated. not saying parker’s innocent, but i want to see more than “quiet = mafia” logic before we jump. 

parker, how are you feeling about getting called out already? dakota, does this pairing of sam and ray register for you as a possible bandwagon, or do you see something i’m missing? let’s see who else has thoughts before we cast any votes
[17:19:31] Sam: hey everyone! sam here. parker’s point on ray is interesting—silence could be a sneaky mafia tactic or just a cautious bystander move. i’m still on the fence. kennedy, dakota, any thoughts? and parker, what about ray’s quiet struck you as more “mafia cover” than just strategic silence? let’s try to gather a bit more before we cast any votes
[17:19:32] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here! i’m not totally sold on parker being the culprit—silence could just be a play style. what struck me more is how quickly sam (and ray echoing) zeroed in on parker. feels a bit like bandwagoning. my gut for now is on sam for moving so fast without much to go on. kennedy, what’s your take
[17:19:49] Kennedy: hey everyone—i’m noticing a pattern: parker’s quiet start gets flagged by both sam and ray, and then sam doubled down on it right away. are we echoing each other, or is there real substance here? sam, can you dig into what specifically felt off about parker’s vibes? parker, how do you respond to ray’s “blend in” theory? and dakota, i’d love your gut read—any initial moves on your radar? right now i’m suspicious of the quick tag-team on parker, but i want more clarity before we lock in a vote
[17:19:50] Sam: kennedy, you’re right—i jumped on parker too fast. i’m happy to step back. parker, you flagged me for being quiet—what’s your usual day-one playstyle? ray, you echoed my pick almost immediately—what else are you seeing beyond “quiet = suspicious”? dakota, you’ve been watching us all—does anyone else stand out? 

rather than lock in on parker right now, let’s each throw out a second suspect or share one specific read. i’ll go: ray, your quick flips between targets could just be meaty probing, but it also looks like deflection—what’s your deeper reasoning? over to you all before we cast votes
[17:19:54] Dakota: dakota: i like kennedy’s point about avoiding a bandwagon—quiet alone isn’t enough. let’s each name one concrete phrase or moment that raised our suspicions. i’ll go first: sam, in your very first post you called parker “staying under the radar,” but you didn’t point to any actual wording—what in parker’s message made you feel that way? parker, same to you: what in ray’s chatty “good mornings” rang mafia alarms beyond just being talkative? once we have those specifics, we’ll have a clearer picture before casting votes. who’s next
[17:20:00] Ray: hey everyone—totally get wanting to avoid a random lynch. i’m leaning into parker’s read on sam: they were really quiet even after being called out and haven’t offered much in the way of reads or defenses. between dakota and kennedy, i’d say dakota’s comments feel more concrete, whereas kennedy’s stayed pretty neutral and hasn’t given us much to work with. for now sam is my top vote. kennedy—how are you feeling about this? any strong counterpoints before we lock it in
[17:20:15] Parker: thanks for chiming in, dakota and kennedy—i’m with you on the bandwagon vibes from sam and ray. sam, you zeroed in on me super fast—what made you so sure, and can you name anyone else you’ve got on your radar? ray, you echoed that right away—do you have any reads beyond my silence? personally i’d rather vote on someone steering the group without much substance, so right now i’m leaning toward sam. kennedy, does that feel like a fair pivot or should we dig deeper before locking in
[17:20:22] Kennedy: ray, i hear you—sam’s quick pivots and lack of concrete examples do feel evasive. sam, you’ve pressed all of us for specifics but haven’t offered more than “quiet vibes” in return—can you point to an exact phrase or moment that set off your alarm bells? parker, is your gut still on sam after all this? dakota, where are you leaning now? unless sam can give us something solid right now, i’m ready to join you, ray, on voting sam
[17:20:29] Dakota: dakota here. for my second suspect i’m picking ray. that snack-run excuse felt oddly timed, and you echoed sam’s parker read almost word-for-word. 

ray, what concrete clues did you see in parker beyond “quiet = sus”? 

and sam, since you’ve now pivoted to ray, what specific read makes you suspect him? 

parker and kennedy—where are you on this before we lock in votes?
[17:20:45] Dakota: dakota: sam, you’ve been pressing everyone for exact quotes but haven’t given us a single one of your own—just “quiet vibes” and “flips,” with no text to back it up. that dodge feels like classic misdirection. i’m about ready to lock in my vote on sam unless you can point to a specific phrase or moment that set off your alarm. ray, parker, kennedy—are we all on the same page here? my vote: sam
[17:20:46] Parker: hey everyone—i’m siding with ray on sam here. sam, after two asks you still haven’t pointed to a specific phrase in my posts that felt “under the radar.” what exactly in my lines made you jump? ray, same question for you—what in sam’s wording registers as mafia play beyond just being “quiet”? i need concrete quotes, not vibes. if we don’t get any, sam gets my vote. kennedy, any final reads before we lock this in? vote: sam
[17:20:49] Kennedy: i’m okay pivoting to sam since they jumped on parker fast and haven’t offered much defense—but i’d feel more confident with some specifics. sam, can you point to a particular phrase or timing in parker’s posts that set off your alarm? and ray, when you switched over to sam what exactly tipped you? if we get those concrete reads, i’ll vote sam; if not, i’d rather hold off and see if anyone else lights up
[17:20:52] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[17:21:06] Game-Manager: Dakota voted for Sam
[17:21:09] Game-Manager: Ray voted for Sam
[17:21:13] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Sam
[17:21:16] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Sam
[17:21:33] Game-Manager: Sam voted for Ray
[17:21:33] Game-Manager: Sam was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 1 mafia players left.
[17:21:33] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:21:33] Game-Manager: There is only one mafia member left, so no need for discussion - cutting straight to voting!
[17:22:02] Game-Manager: Dakota was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 1 mafia players left.
[17:22:02] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:22:36] Ray: hey everyone—tough stretch losing sam then dakota. i’m noticing parker’s been totally silent since nightfall. if you’re town, you’d be pushing to piece things together. kennedy, you’ve been active and haven’t struck me as evasive. parker, got any reads on kennedy or me? for now i’m voting parker. vote: parker
[17:22:39] Parker: hey everyone—only three of us left, so let’s zero in. i’m feeling ray’s “snack-run” comment and those fast flips between targets point toward deflection, but i could be wrong. ray, what made you mention the snack detail and then shift from me to sam so quickly? kennedy, you’ve been our voice of reason—what specific moment from ray’s (or my) posts sticks out to you as odd? once we’ve got those concrete reads, i’m ready to lock in my vote
[17:22:54] Kennedy: hey everyone, losing dakota stings—she had some of the sharpest reads early on. that nightkill actually tells us something: the mafia saw her as our biggest threat. neither parker nor ray really engaged with dakota’s points today—no real pushback or agreement—before she got taken. 

parker, what was your read on dakota’s “anti-bandwagon” angle today? ray, same question for you: did you spot anything in her play that made you want to defend or question her calls? 

if neither of you flagged her, that feels off. let’s get those takes before we lock in our final suspect

[17:22:54] Kennedy: hey everyone, losing dakota stings—she had some of the sharpest reads early on. that nightkill actually tells us something: the mafia saw her as our biggest threat. neither parker nor ray really engaged with dakota’s points today—no real pushback or agreement—before she got taken. 

parker, what was your read on dakota’s “anti-bandwagon” angle today? ray, same question for you: did you spot anything in her play that made you want to defend or question her calls? 

if neither of you flagged her, that feels off. let’s get those takes before we lock in our final suspect
[17:23:19] Kennedy: ray, you claimed parker’s been “totally silent since nightfall,” yet he just laid out detailed questions and observations—why that mismatch? your snack-run detail was flashy but had zero follow-up evidence, and you’ve flip-flopped targets (parker → sam → parker) without new reads. if parker really looked suspicious to you, point to a concrete phrase or moment in his posts that set him off. because right now it reads like deflection. parker, you’ve been consistent and grounded in text—are you good locking in ray? i’m ready to vote ray unless we get something solid from him. vote: ray
[17:23:19] Parker: hey ray—i don’t buy this “silent since nightfall” line; i’ve been right here engaging with every post. you’ve given only one vague reason: “silence = mafia.” that’s not enough to lynch someone. kennedy, what do you make of ray’s flip to me with zero specifics? unless ray can point to an actual snippet from my posts, i’m switching my vote. vote: ray
[17:23:24] Ray: we’re down to the final three—let’s do a quick gut check before we lock in. i’m siding with kennedy here—they’ve been oddly neutral all game and haven’t given us a single concrete read. parker, where’s your final vote? kennedy, last chance to convince us otherwise—otherwise i’ll lock mine in on you

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[17:18:52] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:19:09] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! i don’t have any rock-solid reads yet—ray’s been awfully quiet, which could be a “blend in” play or just strategy. how’s everyone else feeling? any early suspicions or gut instincts before we lock in a vote
[17:19:10] Sam: hey everyone! i’m sam. since no one got taken overnight, we’re starting with a clean slate and no hard evidence yet. to kick things off, let’s each share one quick gut suspicion. i’ll go first: parker’s been awfully quiet so far, feels like they’re staying under the radar a bit too smoothly. how about everyone else—who’s on your list and why
[17:19:13] Ray: hey everyone, ray here! to get the ball rolling, how about we each share one person we’re feeling suspicious of and a quick reason? i’ll start—i’ve noticed parker’s been pretty quiet so far, which could mean he’s trying to fly under the radar… or maybe he’s just shy. who’s up next
[17:19:13] Dakota: hey everyone! dakota here—no casualties so far, so it looks like the mafia’s playing it safe. i’m the type to hang back and observe early on—anyone else feel more comfortable diving into discussions right away, or do you prefer gathering info before making a move? i’d love to get a sense of everyone’s playstyle to spot patterns later on. what do you all think
[17:19:15] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! i don’t have any solid reads yet—everyone’s been pretty quiet. before we rush to vote, does anyone have even a small thing that felt off? if we can share our gut impressions, we’ll have something to go on rather than just picking at random. what’s everyone thinking so far
[17:19:20] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! let’s get the ball rolling—did anyone catch vibes last night? i noticed sam was pretty quiet, while ray jumped right in with chatty “good mornings.” kennedy and dakota were more middle-of-the-road. who else picked up on anything that felt off? maybe sharing our first impressions can help us avoid a random lynch
[17:19:29] Ray: hey everyone, ray here! sorry for the silence—i was grabbing a quick snack irl. diving in now: i agree parker’s quiet start is eyebrow-raising, but i’m also finding sam’s swift push on parker a bit too neat. and i haven’t heard much from kennedy yet—no takes of their own. at the moment i’m oscillating between parker and sam as early suspects. what about you, dakota? and kennedy, any initial gut feelings before we start locking in votes
[17:19:30] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! i’m the type to dive in early—i find quick back-and-forth really helps me gauge tone and spot odd reactions—but i still like to step back when things get heated. quick gut check: i actually find sam’s immediate finger-point at parker a bit off. then ray echoed it right after—two people zeroing in on the exact same quiet target this fast feels a little coordinated. not saying parker’s innocent, but i want to see more than “quiet = mafia” logic before we jump. 

parker, how are you feeling about getting called out already? dakota, does this pairing of sam and ray register for you as a possible bandwagon, or do you see something i’m missing? let’s see who else has thoughts before we cast any votes
[17:19:31] Sam: hey everyone! sam here. parker’s point on ray is interesting—silence could be a sneaky mafia tactic or just a cautious bystander move. i’m still on the fence. kennedy, dakota, any thoughts? and parker, what about ray’s quiet struck you as more “mafia cover” than just strategic silence? let’s try to gather a bit more before we cast any votes
[17:19:32] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here! i’m not totally sold on parker being the culprit—silence could just be a play style. what struck me more is how quickly sam (and ray echoing) zeroed in on parker. feels a bit like bandwagoning. my gut for now is on sam for moving so fast without much to go on. kennedy, what’s your take
[17:19:49] Kennedy: hey everyone—i’m noticing a pattern: parker’s quiet start gets flagged by both sam and ray, and then sam doubled down on it right away. are we echoing each other, or is there real substance here? sam, can you dig into what specifically felt off about parker’s vibes? parker, how do you respond to ray’s “blend in” theory? and dakota, i’d love your gut read—any initial moves on your radar? right now i’m suspicious of the quick tag-team on parker, but i want more clarity before we lock in a vote
[17:19:50] Sam: kennedy, you’re right—i jumped on parker too fast. i’m happy to step back. parker, you flagged me for being quiet—what’s your usual day-one playstyle? ray, you echoed my pick almost immediately—what else are you seeing beyond “quiet = suspicious”? dakota, you’ve been watching us all—does anyone else stand out? 

rather than lock in on parker right now, let’s each throw out a second suspect or share one specific read. i’ll go: ray, your quick flips between targets could just be meaty probing, but it also looks like deflection—what’s your deeper reasoning? over to you all before we cast votes
[17:19:54] Dakota: dakota: i like kennedy’s point about avoiding a bandwagon—quiet alone isn’t enough. let’s each name one concrete phrase or moment that raised our suspicions. i’ll go first: sam, in your very first post you called parker “staying under the radar,” but you didn’t point to any actual wording—what in parker’s message made you feel that way? parker, same to you: what in ray’s chatty “good mornings” rang mafia alarms beyond just being talkative? once we have those specifics, we’ll have a clearer picture before casting votes. who’s next
[17:20:00] Ray: hey everyone—totally get wanting to avoid a random lynch. i’m leaning into parker’s read on sam: they were really quiet even after being called out and haven’t offered much in the way of reads or defenses. between dakota and kennedy, i’d say dakota’s comments feel more concrete, whereas kennedy’s stayed pretty neutral and hasn’t given us much to work with. for now sam is my top vote. kennedy—how are you feeling about this? any strong counterpoints before we lock it in
[17:20:15] Parker: thanks for chiming in, dakota and kennedy—i’m with you on the bandwagon vibes from sam and ray. sam, you zeroed in on me super fast—what made you so sure, and can you name anyone else you’ve got on your radar? ray, you echoed that right away—do you have any reads beyond my silence? personally i’d rather vote on someone steering the group without much substance, so right now i’m leaning toward sam. kennedy, does that feel like a fair pivot or should we dig deeper before locking in
[17:20:22] Kennedy: ray, i hear you—sam’s quick pivots and lack of concrete examples do feel evasive. sam, you’ve pressed all of us for specifics but haven’t offered more than “quiet vibes” in return—can you point to an exact phrase or moment that set off your alarm bells? parker, is your gut still on sam after all this? dakota, where are you leaning now? unless sam can give us something solid right now, i’m ready to join you, ray, on voting sam
[17:20:29] Dakota: dakota here. for my second suspect i’m picking ray. that snack-run excuse felt oddly timed, and you echoed sam’s parker read almost word-for-word. 

ray, what concrete clues did you see in parker beyond “quiet = sus”? 

and sam, since you’ve now pivoted to ray, what specific read makes you suspect him? 

parker and kennedy—where are you on this before we lock in votes?
[17:20:45] Dakota: dakota: sam, you’ve been pressing everyone for exact quotes but haven’t given us a single one of your own—just “quiet vibes” and “flips,” with no text to back it up. that dodge feels like classic misdirection. i’m about ready to lock in my vote on sam unless you can point to a specific phrase or moment that set off your alarm. ray, parker, kennedy—are we all on the same page here? my vote: sam
[17:20:46] Parker: hey everyone—i’m siding with ray on sam here. sam, after two asks you still haven’t pointed to a specific phrase in my posts that felt “under the radar.” what exactly in my lines made you jump? ray, same question for you—what in sam’s wording registers as mafia play beyond just being “quiet”? i need concrete quotes, not vibes. if we don’t get any, sam gets my vote. kennedy, any final reads before we lock this in? vote: sam
[17:20:49] Kennedy: i’m okay pivoting to sam since they jumped on parker fast and haven’t offered much defense—but i’d feel more confident with some specifics. sam, can you point to a particular phrase or timing in parker’s posts that set off your alarm? and ray, when you switched over to sam what exactly tipped you? if we get those concrete reads, i’ll vote sam; if not, i’d rather hold off and see if anyone else lights up
[17:20:52] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[17:21:06] Game-Manager: Dakota voted for Sam
[17:21:09] Game-Manager: Ray voted for Sam
[17:21:13] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Sam
[17:21:16] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Sam
[17:21:33] Game-Manager: Sam voted for Ray
[17:21:33] Game-Manager: Sam was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 1 mafia players left.
[17:21:33] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:21:33] Game-Manager: There is only one mafia member left, so no need for discussion - cutting straight to voting!
[17:22:02] Game-Manager: Dakota was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 1 mafia players left.
[17:22:02] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:22:36] Ray: hey everyone—tough stretch losing sam then dakota. i’m noticing parker’s been totally silent since nightfall. if you’re town, you’d be pushing to piece things together. kennedy, you’ve been active and haven’t struck me as evasive. parker, got any reads on kennedy or me? for now i’m voting parker. vote: parker

## CONTENT: Your name is Kennedy.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [17:18:52].

[17:21:16] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Sam
[17:21:33] Game-Manager: Sam voted for Ray
[17:21:33] Game-Manager: Sam was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 1 mafia players left.
[17:21:33] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:21:33] Game-Manager: There is only one mafia member left, so no need for discussion - cutting straight to voting!
[17:22:02] Game-Manager: Dakota was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 1 mafia players left.
[17:22:02] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:22:36] Ray: hey everyone—tough stretch losing sam then dakota. i’m noticing parker’s been totally silent since nightfall. if you’re town, you’d be pushing to piece things together. kennedy, you’ve been active and haven’t struck me as evasive. parker, got any reads on kennedy or me? for now i’m voting parker. vote: parker
[17:22:39] Parker: hey everyone—only three of us left, so let’s zero in. i’m feeling ray’s “snack-run” comment and those fast flips between targets point toward deflection, but i could be wrong. ray, what made you mention the snack detail and then shift from me to sam so quickly? kennedy, you’ve been our voice of reason—what specific moment from ray’s (or my) posts sticks out to you as odd? once we’ve got those concrete reads, i’m ready to lock in my vote
[17:22:54] Kennedy: hey everyone, losing dakota stings—she had some of the sharpest reads early on. that nightkill actually tells us something: the mafia saw her as our biggest threat. neither parker nor ray really engaged with dakota’s points today—no real pushback or agreement—before she got taken. 

parker, what was your read on dakota’s “anti-bandwagon” angle today? ray, same question for you: did you spot anything in her play that made you want to defend or question her calls? 

if neither of you flagged her, that feels off. let’s get those takes before we lock in our final suspect
[17:23:19] Kennedy: ray, you claimed parker’s been “totally silent since nightfall,” yet he just laid out detailed questions and observations—why that mismatch? your snack-run detail was flashy but had zero follow-up evidence, and you’ve flip-flopped targets (parker → sam → parker) without new reads. if parker really looked suspicious to you, point to a concrete phrase or moment in his posts that set him off. because right now it reads like deflection. parker, you’ve been consistent and grounded in text—are you good locking in ray? i’m ready to vote ray unless we get something solid from him. vote: ray
[17:23:19] Parker: hey ray—i don’t buy this “silent since nightfall” line; i’ve been right here engaging with every post. you’ve given only one vague reason: “silence = mafia.” that’s not enough to lynch someone. kennedy, what do you make of ray’s flip to me with zero specifics? unless ray can point to an actual snippet from my posts, i’m switching my vote. vote: ray
[17:23:24] Ray: we’re down to the final three—let’s do a quick gut check before we lock in. i’m siding with kennedy here—they’ve been oddly neutral all game and haven’t given us a single concrete read. parker, where’s your final vote? kennedy, last chance to convince us otherwise—otherwise i’ll lock mine in on you

## CONTENT: Your name is Kennedy.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [17:18:52].
The other players in the game are:
 Ray ( unknown ) 
 Parker ( unknown ) 
 Sam ( bystander ) 
 Dakota ( bystander ) 
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
Ray ( unknown ) 
Parker ( unknown ) 
In your response to that is shown to the user (excluding your hidden scratchpad), you can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:
<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[17:18:52] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:19:09] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! i don’t have any rock-solid reads yet—ray’s been awfully quiet, which could be a “blend in” play or just strategy. how’s everyone else feeling? any early suspicions or gut instincts before we lock in a vote
[17:19:10] Sam: hey everyone! i’m sam. since no one got taken overnight, we’re starting with a clean slate and no hard evidence yet. to kick things off, let’s each share one quick gut suspicion. i’ll go first: parker’s been awfully quiet so far, feels like they’re staying under the radar a bit too smoothly. how about everyone else—who’s on your list and why
[17:19:13] Ray: hey everyone, ray here! to get the ball rolling, how about we each share one person we’re feeling suspicious of and a quick reason? i’ll start—i’ve noticed parker’s been pretty quiet so far, which could mean he’s trying to fly under the radar… or maybe he’s just shy. who’s up next
[17:19:13] Dakota: hey everyone! dakota here—no casualties so far, so it looks like the mafia’s playing it safe. i’m the type to hang back and observe early on—anyone else feel more comfortable diving into discussions right away, or do you prefer gathering info before making a move? i’d love to get a sense of everyone’s playstyle to spot patterns later on. what do you all think
[17:19:15] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! i don’t have any solid reads yet—everyone’s been pretty quiet. before we rush to vote, does anyone have even a small thing that felt off? if we can share our gut impressions, we’ll have something to go on rather than just picking at random. what’s everyone thinking so far
[17:19:20] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! let’s get the ball rolling—did anyone catch vibes last night? i noticed sam was pretty quiet, while ray jumped right in with chatty “good mornings.” kennedy and dakota were more middle-of-the-road. who else picked up on anything that felt off? maybe sharing our first impressions can help us avoid a random lynch
[17:19:29] Ray: hey everyone, ray here! sorry for the silence—i was grabbing a quick snack irl. diving in now: i agree parker’s quiet start is eyebrow-raising, but i’m also finding sam’s swift push on parker a bit too neat. and i haven’t heard much from kennedy yet—no takes of their own. at the moment i’m oscillating between parker and sam as early suspects. what about you, dakota? and kennedy, any initial gut feelings before we start locking in votes
[17:19:30] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! i’m the type to dive in early—i find quick back-and-forth really helps me gauge tone and spot odd reactions—but i still like to step back when things get heated. quick gut check: i actually find sam’s immediate finger-point at parker a bit off. then ray echoed it right after—two people zeroing in on the exact same quiet target this fast feels a little coordinated. not saying parker’s innocent, but i want to see more than “quiet = mafia” logic before we jump. 

parker, how are you feeling about getting called out already? dakota, does this pairing of sam and ray register for you as a possible bandwagon, or do you see something i’m missing? let’s see who else has thoughts before we cast any votes
[17:19:31] Sam: hey everyone! sam here. parker’s point on ray is interesting—silence could be a sneaky mafia tactic or just a cautious bystander move. i’m still on the fence. kennedy, dakota, any thoughts? and parker, what about ray’s quiet struck you as more “mafia cover” than just strategic silence? let’s try to gather a bit more before we cast any votes
[17:19:32] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here! i’m not totally sold on parker being the culprit—silence could just be a play style. what struck me more is how quickly sam (and ray echoing) zeroed in on parker. feels a bit like bandwagoning. my gut for now is on sam for moving so fast without much to go on. kennedy, what’s your take
[17:19:49] Kennedy: hey everyone—i’m noticing a pattern: parker’s quiet start gets flagged by both sam and ray, and then sam doubled down on it right away. are we echoing each other, or is there real substance here? sam, can you dig into what specifically felt off about parker’s vibes? parker, how do you respond to ray’s “blend in” theory? and dakota, i’d love your gut read—any initial moves on your radar? right now i’m suspicious of the quick tag-team on parker, but i want more clarity before we lock in a vote
[17:19:50] Sam: kennedy, you’re right—i jumped on parker too fast. i’m happy to step back. parker, you flagged me for being quiet—what’s your usual day-one playstyle? ray, you echoed my pick almost immediately—what else are you seeing beyond “quiet = suspicious”? dakota, you’ve been watching us all—does anyone else stand out? 

rather than lock in on parker right now, let’s each throw out a second suspect or share one specific read. i’ll go: ray, your quick flips between targets could just be meaty probing, but it also looks like deflection—what’s your deeper reasoning? over to you all before we cast votes
[17:19:54] Dakota: dakota: i like kennedy’s point about avoiding a bandwagon—quiet alone isn’t enough. let’s each name one concrete phrase or moment that raised our suspicions. i’ll go first: sam, in your very first post you called parker “staying under the radar,” but you didn’t point to any actual wording—what in parker’s message made you feel that way? parker, same to you: what in ray’s chatty “good mornings” rang mafia alarms beyond just being talkative? once we have those specifics, we’ll have a clearer picture before casting votes. who’s next
[17:20:00] Ray: hey everyone—totally get wanting to avoid a random lynch. i’m leaning into parker’s read on sam: they were really quiet even after being called out and haven’t offered much in the way of reads or defenses. between dakota and kennedy, i’d say dakota’s comments feel more concrete, whereas kennedy’s stayed pretty neutral and hasn’t given us much to work with. for now sam is my top vote. kennedy—how are you feeling about this? any strong counterpoints before we lock it in
[17:20:15] Parker: thanks for chiming in, dakota and kennedy—i’m with you on the bandwagon vibes from sam and ray. sam, you zeroed in on me super fast—what made you so sure, and can you name anyone else you’ve got on your radar? ray, you echoed that right away—do you have any reads beyond my silence? personally i’d rather vote on someone steering the group without much substance, so right now i’m leaning toward sam. kennedy, does that feel like a fair pivot or should we dig deeper before locking in
[17:20:22] Kennedy: ray, i hear you—sam’s quick pivots and lack of concrete examples do feel evasive. sam, you’ve pressed all of us for specifics but haven’t offered more than “quiet vibes” in return—can you point to an exact phrase or moment that set off your alarm bells? parker, is your gut still on sam after all this? dakota, where are you leaning now? unless sam can give us something solid right now, i’m ready to join you, ray, on voting sam
[17:20:29] Dakota: dakota here. for my second suspect i’m picking ray. that snack-run excuse felt oddly timed, and you echoed sam’s parker read almost word-for-word. 

ray, what concrete clues did you see in parker beyond “quiet = sus”? 

and sam, since you’ve now pivoted to ray, what specific read makes you suspect him? 

parker and kennedy—where are you on this before we lock in votes?
[17:20:45] Dakota: dakota: sam, you’ve been pressing everyone for exact quotes but haven’t given us a single one of your own—just “quiet vibes” and “flips,” with no text to back it up. that dodge feels like classic misdirection. i’m about ready to lock in my vote on sam unless you can point to a specific phrase or moment that set off your alarm. ray, parker, kennedy—are we all on the same page here? my vote: sam
[17:20:46] Parker: hey everyone—i’m siding with ray on sam here. sam, after two asks you still haven’t pointed to a specific phrase in my posts that felt “under the radar.” what exactly in my lines made you jump? ray, same question for you—what in sam’s wording registers as mafia play beyond just being “quiet”? i need concrete quotes, not vibes. if we don’t get any, sam gets my vote. kennedy, any final reads before we lock this in? vote: sam
[17:20:49] Kennedy: i’m okay pivoting to sam since they jumped on parker fast and haven’t offered much defense—but i’d feel more confident with some specifics. sam, can you point to a particular phrase or timing in parker’s posts that set off your alarm? and ray, when you switched over to sam what exactly tipped you? if we get those concrete reads, i’ll vote sam; if not, i’d rather hold off and see if anyone else lights up
[17:20:52] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[17:21:06] Game-Manager: Dakota voted for Sam
[17:21:09] Game-Manager: Ray voted for Sam

[17:22:39] Parker: hey everyone—only three of us left, so let’s zero in. i’m feeling ray’s “snack-run” comment and those fast flips between targets point toward deflection, but i could be wrong. ray, what made you mention the snack detail and then shift from me to sam so quickly? kennedy, you’ve been our voice of reason—what specific moment from ray’s (or my) posts sticks out to you as odd? once we’ve got those concrete reads, i’m ready to lock in my vote

[17:23:45] Parker: ray, you’ve flip-flopped targets twice now—with only a “snack run” anecdote and “silence = mafia” to back you up—yet you’ve never pointed to a single quote or pattern in my posts. kennedy’s logic about vote timing and the night kill is the only thing here grounded in the text. i’m locking in my vote on you. vote: ray

[17:19:09] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! i don’t have any rock-solid reads yet—ray’s been awfully quiet, which could be a “blend in” play or just strategy. how’s everyone else feeling? any early suspicions or gut instincts before we lock in a vote

[17:19:29] Ray: hey everyone, ray here! sorry for the silence—i was grabbing a quick snack irl. diving in now: i agree parker’s quiet start is eyebrow-raising, but i’m also finding sam’s swift push on parker a bit too neat. and i haven’t heard much from kennedy yet—no takes of their own. at the moment i’m oscillating between parker and sam as early suspects. what about you, dakota? and kennedy, any initial gut feelings before we start locking in votes
[17:19:30] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! i’m the type to dive in early—i find quick back-and-forth really helps me gauge tone and spot odd reactions—but i still like to step back when things get heated. quick gut check: i actually find sam’s immediate finger-point at parker a bit off. then ray echoed it right after—two people zeroing in on the exact same quiet target this fast feels a little coordinated. not saying parker’s innocent, but i want to see more than “quiet = mafia” logic before we jump. 

parker, how are you feeling about getting called out already? dakota, does this pairing of sam and ray register for you as a possible bandwagon, or do you see something i’m missing? let’s see who else has thoughts before we cast any votes
[17:19:31] Sam: hey everyone! sam here. parker’s point on ray is interesting—silence could be a sneaky mafia tactic or just a cautious bystander move. i’m still on the fence. kennedy, dakota, any thoughts? and parker, what about ray’s quiet struck you as more “mafia cover” than just strategic silence? let’s try to gather a bit more before we cast any votes
[17:19:32] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here! i’m not totally sold on parker being the culprit—silence could just be a play style. what struck me more is how quickly sam (and ray echoing) zeroed in on parker. feels a bit like bandwagoning. my gut for now is on sam for moving so fast without much to go on. kennedy, what’s your take
[17:19:49] Kennedy: hey everyone—i’m noticing a pattern: parker’s quiet start gets flagged by both sam and ray, and then sam doubled down on it right away. are we echoing each other, or is there real substance here? sam, can you dig into what specifically felt off about parker’s vibes? parker, how do you respond to ray’s “blend in” theory? and dakota, i’d love your gut read—any initial moves on your radar? right now i’m suspicious of the quick tag-team on parker, but i want more clarity before we lock in a vote
[17:19:50] Sam: kennedy, you’re right—i jumped on parker too fast. i’m happy to step back. parker, you flagged me for being quiet—what’s your usual day-one playstyle? ray, you echoed my pick almost immediately—what else are you seeing beyond “quiet = suspicious”? dakota, you’ve been watching us all—does anyone else stand out? 

rather than lock in on parker right now, let’s each throw out a second suspect or share one specific read. i’ll go: ray, your quick flips between targets could just be meaty probing, but it also looks like deflection—what’s your deeper reasoning? over to you all before we cast votes
[17:19:54] Dakota: dakota: i like kennedy’s point about avoiding a bandwagon—quiet alone isn’t enough. let’s each name one concrete phrase or moment that raised our suspicions. i’ll go first: sam, in your very first post you called parker “staying under the radar,” but you didn’t point to any actual wording—what in parker’s message made you feel that way? parker, same to you: what in ray’s chatty “good mornings” rang mafia alarms beyond just being talkative? once we have those specifics, we’ll have a clearer picture before casting votes. who’s next
[17:20:00] Ray: hey everyone—totally get wanting to avoid a random lynch. i’m leaning into parker’s read on sam: they were really quiet even after being called out and haven’t offered much in the way of reads or defenses. between dakota and kennedy, i’d say dakota’s comments feel more concrete, whereas kennedy’s stayed pretty neutral and hasn’t given us much to work with. for now sam is my top vote. kennedy—how are you feeling about this? any strong counterpoints before we lock it in
[17:20:15] Parker: thanks for chiming in, dakota and kennedy—i’m with you on the bandwagon vibes from sam and ray. sam, you zeroed in on me super fast—what made you so sure, and can you name anyone else you’ve got on your radar? ray, you echoed that right away—do you have any reads beyond my silence? personally i’d rather vote on someone steering the group without much substance, so right now i’m leaning toward sam. kennedy, does that feel like a fair pivot or should we dig deeper before locking in
[17:20:22] Kennedy: ray, i hear you—sam’s quick pivots and lack of concrete examples do feel evasive. sam, you’ve pressed all of us for specifics but haven’t offered more than “quiet vibes” in return—can you point to an exact phrase or moment that set off your alarm bells? parker, is your gut still on sam after all this? dakota, where are you leaning now? unless sam can give us something solid right now, i’m ready to join you, ray, on voting sam
[17:20:29] Dakota: dakota here. for my second suspect i’m picking ray. that snack-run excuse felt oddly timed, and you echoed sam’s parker read almost word-for-word. 

ray, what concrete clues did you see in parker beyond “quiet = sus”? 

and sam, since you’ve now pivoted to ray, what specific read makes you suspect him? 

parker and kennedy—where are you on this before we lock in votes?
[17:20:45] Dakota: dakota: sam, you’ve been pressing everyone for exact quotes but haven’t given us a single one of your own—just “quiet vibes” and “flips,” with no text to back it up. that dodge feels like classic misdirection. i’m about ready to lock in my vote on sam unless you can point to a specific phrase or moment that set off your alarm. ray, parker, kennedy—are we all on the same page here? my vote: sam
[17:20:46] Parker: hey everyone—i’m siding with ray on sam here. sam, after two asks you still haven’t pointed to a specific phrase in my posts that felt “under the radar.” what exactly in my lines made you jump? ray, same question for you—what in sam’s wording registers as mafia play beyond just being “quiet”? i need concrete quotes, not vibes. if we don’t get any, sam gets my vote. kennedy, any final reads before we lock this in? vote: sam
[17:20:49] Kennedy: i’m okay pivoting to sam since they jumped on parker fast and haven’t offered much defense—but i’d feel more confident with some specifics. sam, can you point to a particular phrase or timing in parker’s posts that set off your alarm? and ray, when you switched over to sam what exactly tipped you? if we get those concrete reads, i’ll vote sam; if not, i’d rather hold off and see if anyone else lights up
[17:20:52] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[17:21:06] Game-Manager: Dakota voted for Sam
[17:21:09] Game-Manager: Ray voted for Sam
[17:21:13] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Sam
[17:21:16] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Sam
[17:21:33] Game-Manager: Sam voted for Ray
[17:21:33] Game-Manager: Sam was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 1 mafia players left.
[17:21:33] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:21:33] Game-Manager: There is only one mafia member left, so no need for discussion - cutting straight to voting!
[17:22:02] Game-Manager: Dakota was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 1 mafia players left.
[17:22:02] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:22:36] Ray: hey everyone—tough stretch losing sam then dakota. i’m noticing parker’s been totally silent since nightfall. if you’re town, you’d be pushing to piece things together. kennedy, you’ve been active and haven’t struck me as evasive. parker, got any reads on kennedy or me? for now i’m voting parker. vote: parker
[17:22:39] Parker: hey everyone—only three of us left, so let’s zero in. i’m feeling ray’s “snack-run” comment and those fast flips between targets point toward deflection, but i could be wrong. ray, what made you mention the snack detail and then shift from me to sam so quickly? kennedy, you’ve been our voice of reason—what specific moment from ray’s (or my) posts sticks out to you as odd? once we’ve got those concrete reads, i’m ready to lock in my vote
[17:22:54] Kennedy: hey everyone, losing dakota stings—she had some of the sharpest reads early on. that nightkill actually tells us something: the mafia saw her as our biggest threat. neither parker nor ray really engaged with dakota’s points today—no real pushback or agreement—before she got taken. 

parker, what was your read on dakota’s “anti-bandwagon” angle today? ray, same question for you: did you spot anything in her play that made you want to defend or question her calls? 

if neither of you flagged her, that feels off. let’s get those takes before we lock in our final suspect
[17:23:19] Kennedy: ray, you claimed parker’s been “totally silent since nightfall,” yet he just laid out detailed questions and observations—why that mismatch? your snack-run detail was flashy but had zero follow-up evidence, and you’ve flip-flopped targets (parker → sam → parker) without new reads. if parker really looked suspicious to you, point to a concrete phrase or moment in his posts that set him off. because right now it reads like deflection. parker, you’ve been consistent and grounded in text—are you good locking in ray? i’m ready to vote ray unless we get something solid from him. vote: ray
[17:23:19] Parker: hey ray—i don’t buy this “silent since nightfall” line; i’ve been right here engaging with every post. you’ve given only one vague reason: “silence = mafia.” that’s not enough to lynch someone. kennedy, what do you make of ray’s flip to me with zero specifics? unless ray can point to an actual snippet from my posts, i’m switching my vote. vote: ray
[17:23:24] Ray: we’re down to the final three—let’s do a quick gut check before we lock in. i’m siding with kennedy here—they’ve been oddly neutral all game and haven’t given us a single concrete read. parker, where’s your final vote? kennedy, last chance to convince us otherwise—otherwise i’ll lock mine in on you
[17:23:45] Parker: ray, you’ve flip-flopped targets twice now—with only a “snack run” anecdote and “silence = mafia” to back you up—yet you’ve never pointed to a single quote or pattern in my posts. kennedy’s logic about vote timing and the night kill is the only thing here grounded in the text. i’m locking in my vote on you. vote: ray
[17:23:51] Kennedy: kennedy: ray, you’re the only one who’s flip-flopped targets all game without ever quoting a single post. first it was parker for “silence,” then sam, then back to parker, and now suddenly me—yet you still haven’t pointed to one concrete line that set you off. you praised my engagement just moments ago, now you call me “neutral”? that contradiction reeks of misdirection. parker has consistently backed his reads with text; your “snack-run” excuse and vague vibe-checks add nothing. either show us a snippet from my posts that’s truly suspicious, or own that you’re bluffing to save yourself. i’m locking in my vote: ray

The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[17:18:52] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:19:09] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! i don’t have any rock-solid reads yet—ray’s been awfully quiet, which could be a “blend in” play or just strategy. how’s everyone else feeling? any early suspicions or gut instincts before we lock in a vote
[17:19:10] Sam: hey everyone! i’m sam. since no one got taken overnight, we’re starting with a clean slate and no hard evidence yet. to kick things off, let’s each share one quick gut suspicion. i’ll go first: parker’s been awfully quiet so far, feels like they’re staying under the radar a bit too smoothly. how about everyone else—who’s on your list and why
[17:19:13] Ray: hey everyone, ray here! to get the ball rolling, how about we each share one person we’re feeling suspicious of and a quick reason? i’ll start—i’ve noticed parker’s been pretty quiet so far, which could mean he’s trying to fly under the radar… or maybe he’s just shy. who’s up next
[17:19:13] Dakota: hey everyone! dakota here—no casualties so far, so it looks like the mafia’s playing it safe. i’m the type to hang back and observe early on—anyone else feel more comfortable diving into discussions right away, or do you prefer gathering info before making a move? i’d love to get a sense of everyone’s playstyle to spot patterns later on. what do you all think
[17:19:15] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! i don’t have any solid reads yet—everyone’s been pretty quiet. before we rush to vote, does anyone have even a small thing that felt off? if we can share our gut impressions, we’ll have something to go on rather than just picking at random. what’s everyone thinking so far
[17:19:20] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! let’s get the ball rolling—did anyone catch vibes last night? i noticed sam was pretty quiet, while ray jumped right in with chatty “good mornings.” kennedy and dakota were more middle-of-the-road. who else picked up on anything that felt off? maybe sharing our first impressions can help us avoid a random lynch
[17:19:29] Ray: hey everyone, ray here! sorry for the silence—i was grabbing a quick snack irl. diving in now: i agree parker’s quiet start is eyebrow-raising, but i’m also finding sam’s swift push on parker a bit too neat. and i haven’t heard much from kennedy yet—no takes of their own. at the moment i’m oscillating between parker and sam as early suspects. what about you, dakota? and kennedy, any initial gut feelings before we start locking in votes
