[17:19:10] Sam: hey everyone! i’m sam. since no one got taken overnight, we’re starting with a clean slate and no hard evidence yet. to kick things off, let’s each share one quick gut suspicion. i’ll go first: parker’s been awfully quiet so far, feels like they’re staying under the radar a bit too smoothly. how about everyone else—who’s on your list and why
[17:19:31] Sam: hey everyone! sam here. parker’s point on ray is interesting—silence could be a sneaky mafia tactic or just a cautious bystander move. i’m still on the fence. kennedy, dakota, any thoughts? and parker, what about ray’s quiet struck you as more “mafia cover” than just strategic silence? let’s try to gather a bit more before we cast any votes
[17:19:50] Sam: kennedy, you’re right—i jumped on parker too fast. i’m happy to step back. parker, you flagged me for being quiet—what’s your usual day-one playstyle? ray, you echoed my pick almost immediately—what else are you seeing beyond “quiet = suspicious”? dakota, you’ve been watching us all—does anyone else stand out? 

rather than lock in on parker right now, let’s each throw out a second suspect or share one specific read. i’ll go: ray, your quick flips between targets could just be meaty probing, but it also looks like deflection—what’s your deeper reasoning? over to you all before we cast votes
