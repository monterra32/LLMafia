[17:19:13] Ray: hey everyone, ray here! to get the ball rolling, how about we each share one person we’re feeling suspicious of and a quick reason? i’ll start—i’ve noticed parker’s been pretty quiet so far, which could mean he’s trying to fly under the radar… or maybe he’s just shy. who’s up next
[17:19:29] Ray: hey everyone, ray here! sorry for the silence—i was grabbing a quick snack irl. diving in now: i agree parker’s quiet start is eyebrow-raising, but i’m also finding sam’s swift push on parker a bit too neat. and i haven’t heard much from kennedy yet—no takes of their own. at the moment i’m oscillating between parker and sam as early suspects. what about you, dakota? and kennedy, any initial gut feelings before we start locking in votes
[17:20:00] Ray: hey everyone—totally get wanting to avoid a random lynch. i’m leaning into parker’s read on sam: they were really quiet even after being called out and haven’t offered much in the way of reads or defenses. between dakota and kennedy, i’d say dakota’s comments feel more concrete, whereas kennedy’s stayed pretty neutral and hasn’t given us much to work with. for now sam is my top vote. kennedy—how are you feeling about this? any strong counterpoints before we lock it in
[17:22:36] Ray: hey everyone—tough stretch losing sam then dakota. i’m noticing parker’s been totally silent since nightfall. if you’re town, you’d be pushing to piece things together. kennedy, you’ve been active and haven’t struck me as evasive. parker, got any reads on kennedy or me? for now i’m voting parker. vote: parker
[17:23:24] Ray: we’re down to the final three—let’s do a quick gut check before we lock in. i’m siding with kennedy here—they’ve been oddly neutral all game and haven’t given us a single concrete read. parker, where’s your final vote? kennedy, last chance to convince us otherwise—otherwise i’ll lock mine in on you
