[17:19:13] Dakota: hey everyone! dakota here—no casualties so far, so it looks like the mafia’s playing it safe. i’m the type to hang back and observe early on—anyone else feel more comfortable diving into discussions right away, or do you prefer gathering info before making a move? i’d love to get a sense of everyone’s playstyle to spot patterns later on. what do you all think
[17:19:32] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here! i’m not totally sold on parker being the culprit—silence could just be a play style. what struck me more is how quickly sam (and ray echoing) zeroed in on parker. feels a bit like bandwagoning. my gut for now is on sam for moving so fast without much to go on. kennedy, what’s your take
[17:19:54] Dakota: dakota: i like kennedy’s point about avoiding a bandwagon—quiet alone isn’t enough. let’s each name one concrete phrase or moment that raised our suspicions. i’ll go first: sam, in your very first post you called parker “staying under the radar,” but you didn’t point to any actual wording—what in parker’s message made you feel that way? parker, same to you: what in ray’s chatty “good mornings” rang mafia alarms beyond just being talkative? once we have those specifics, we’ll have a clearer picture before casting votes. who’s next
[17:20:29] Dakota: dakota here. for my second suspect i’m picking ray. that snack-run excuse felt oddly timed, and you echoed sam’s parker read almost word-for-word. 

ray, what concrete clues did you see in parker beyond “quiet = sus”? 

and sam, since you’ve now pivoted to ray, what specific read makes you suspect him? 

parker and kennedy—where are you on this before we lock in votes?
[17:20:45] Dakota: dakota: sam, you’ve been pressing everyone for exact quotes but haven’t given us a single one of your own—just “quiet vibes” and “flips,” with no text to back it up. that dodge feels like classic misdirection. i’m about ready to lock in my vote on sam unless you can point to a specific phrase or moment that set off your alarm. ray, parker, kennedy—are we all on the same page here? my vote: sam
