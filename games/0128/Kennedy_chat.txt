[17:19:15] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! i don’t have any solid reads yet—everyone’s been pretty quiet. before we rush to vote, does anyone have even a small thing that felt off? if we can share our gut impressions, we’ll have something to go on rather than just picking at random. what’s everyone thinking so far
[17:19:30] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! i’m the type to dive in early—i find quick back-and-forth really helps me gauge tone and spot odd reactions—but i still like to step back when things get heated. quick gut check: i actually find sam’s immediate finger-point at parker a bit off. then ray echoed it right after—two people zeroing in on the exact same quiet target this fast feels a little coordinated. not saying parker’s innocent, but i want to see more than “quiet = mafia” logic before we jump. 

parker, how are you feeling about getting called out already? dakota, does this pairing of sam and ray register for you as a possible bandwagon, or do you see something i’m missing? let’s see who else has thoughts before we cast any votes
[17:19:49] Kennedy: hey everyone—i’m noticing a pattern: parker’s quiet start gets flagged by both sam and ray, and then sam doubled down on it right away. are we echoing each other, or is there real substance here? sam, can you dig into what specifically felt off about parker’s vibes? parker, how do you respond to ray’s “blend in” theory? and dakota, i’d love your gut read—any initial moves on your radar? right now i’m suspicious of the quick tag-team on parker, but i want more clarity before we lock in a vote
[17:20:22] Kennedy: ray, i hear you—sam’s quick pivots and lack of concrete examples do feel evasive. sam, you’ve pressed all of us for specifics but haven’t offered more than “quiet vibes” in return—can you point to an exact phrase or moment that set off your alarm bells? parker, is your gut still on sam after all this? dakota, where are you leaning now? unless sam can give us something solid right now, i’m ready to join you, ray, on voting sam
[17:20:49] Kennedy: i’m okay pivoting to sam since they jumped on parker fast and haven’t offered much defense—but i’d feel more confident with some specifics. sam, can you point to a particular phrase or timing in parker’s posts that set off your alarm? and ray, when you switched over to sam what exactly tipped you? if we get those concrete reads, i’ll vote sam; if not, i’d rather hold off and see if anyone else lights up
[17:22:54] Kennedy: hey everyone, losing dakota stings—she had some of the sharpest reads early on. that nightkill actually tells us something: the mafia saw her as our biggest threat. neither parker nor ray really engaged with dakota’s points today—no real pushback or agreement—before she got taken. 

parker, what was your read on dakota’s “anti-bandwagon” angle today? ray, same question for you: did you spot anything in her play that made you want to defend or question her calls? 

if neither of you flagged her, that feels off. let’s get those takes before we lock in our final suspect
[17:23:19] Kennedy: ray, you claimed parker’s been “totally silent since nightfall,” yet he just laid out detailed questions and observations—why that mismatch? your snack-run detail was flashy but had zero follow-up evidence, and you’ve flip-flopped targets (parker → sam → parker) without new reads. if parker really looked suspicious to you, point to a concrete phrase or moment in his posts that set him off. because right now it reads like deflection. parker, you’ve been consistent and grounded in text—are you good locking in ray? i’m ready to vote ray unless we get something solid from him. vote: ray
[17:23:51] Kennedy: kennedy: ray, you’re the only one who’s flip-flopped targets all game without ever quoting a single post. first it was parker for “silence,” then sam, then back to parker, and now suddenly me—yet you still haven’t pointed to one concrete line that set you off. you praised my engagement just moments ago, now you call me “neutral”? that contradiction reeks of misdirection. parker has consistently backed his reads with text; your “snack-run” excuse and vague vibe-checks add nothing. either show us a snippet from my posts that’s truly suspicious, or own that you’re bluffing to save yourself. i’m locking in my vote: ray
