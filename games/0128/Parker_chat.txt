[17:19:09] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! i don’t have any rock-solid reads yet—ray’s been awfully quiet, which could be a “blend in” play or just strategy. how’s everyone else feeling? any early suspicions or gut instincts before we lock in a vote
[17:19:20] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! let’s get the ball rolling—did anyone catch vibes last night? i noticed sam was pretty quiet, while ray jumped right in with chatty “good mornings.” kennedy and dakota were more middle-of-the-road. who else picked up on anything that felt off? maybe sharing our first impressions can help us avoid a random lynch
[17:20:15] Parker: thanks for chiming in, dakota and kennedy—i’m with you on the bandwagon vibes from sam and ray. sam, you zeroed in on me super fast—what made you so sure, and can you name anyone else you’ve got on your radar? ray, you echoed that right away—do you have any reads beyond my silence? personally i’d rather vote on someone steering the group without much substance, so right now i’m leaning toward sam. kennedy, does that feel like a fair pivot or should we dig deeper before locking in
[17:20:46] Parker: hey everyone—i’m siding with ray on sam here. sam, after two asks you still haven’t pointed to a specific phrase in my posts that felt “under the radar.” what exactly in my lines made you jump? ray, same question for you—what in sam’s wording registers as mafia play beyond just being “quiet”? i need concrete quotes, not vibes. if we don’t get any, sam gets my vote. kennedy, any final reads before we lock this in? vote: sam
[17:22:39] Parker: hey everyone—only three of us left, so let’s zero in. i’m feeling ray’s “snack-run” comment and those fast flips between targets point toward deflection, but i could be wrong. ray, what made you mention the snack detail and then shift from me to sam so quickly? kennedy, you’ve been our voice of reason—what specific moment from ray’s (or my) posts sticks out to you as odd? once we’ve got those concrete reads, i’m ready to lock in my vote
[17:23:19] Parker: hey ray—i don’t buy this “silent since nightfall” line; i’ve been right here engaging with every post. you’ve given only one vague reason: “silence = mafia.” that’s not enough to lynch someone. kennedy, what do you make of ray’s flip to me with zero specifics? unless ray can point to an actual snippet from my posts, i’m switching my vote. vote: ray
[17:23:45] Parker: ray, you’ve flip-flopped targets twice now—with only a “snack run” anecdote and “silence = mafia” to back you up—yet you’ve never pointed to a single quote or pattern in my posts. kennedy’s logic about vote timing and the night kill is the only thing here grounded in the text. i’m locking in my vote on you. vote: ray
