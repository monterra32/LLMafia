[16:36:40] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 5.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[16:36:52] Mickey: hey everyone, mickey here! day 1’s always a scramble, so let’s break the ice—maybe share one quick thing you look for in someone you suspect. for me, i watch for people who over-explain or stay super quiet. what about you? let’s get some vibes going before we cast our first vote
[16:36:54] River: hey everyone! river here—stoked to be playing. day 1 chatter can be tough with nobody saying a word yet, so let’s kick things off. any early vibes? who do you think might be testing the waters too much… or suspiciously staying silent? i’ll be paying close attention
[16:36:56] Drew: hey everyone, drew here—happy to be in the game! day 1 can be tough with no hard info yet, so i’m usually in “observation mode” early on. what do you all think: do we start tossing names out right away based on vibes, or hold off until we get a night kill for more clues? any initial gut feelings on who’s acting a bit off already? let’s break the ice
[16:36:58] Kai: hey everyone, kai here—excited to get rolling! for day 1, i suggest we each share a quick gut reaction. i’m not suspecting anyone yet, but i’ll be keeping an eye on who barrels in versus who hangs back. who wants to go first

# NEW LOG
## TIME: 16:37:02
## OPERATION: Complete Prompt to LLM
## CONTENT: Your name is Gray.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  
You were assigned the following role: mafia.
