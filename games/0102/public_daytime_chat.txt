[16:32:18] Charlie: hey everyone, charlie here. no real leads yet, so i’m going to place a placeholder vote on parker just to get things moving. sam, what do you think? any gut feelings or doubts so far
[16:32:21] Parker: hey sam, hey charlie! day 1 always feels like a bit of a coin flip, but in my experience the mafia either pushes for a quick vote or stays way too quiet. we didn’t get much of an intro—did either of you pick up on anything odd just now? i’m inclined to hang back a bit and see who starts making bold moves. what are your thoughts
[16:32:26] Sam: hi parker, charlie! sam here. i haven’t spotted any clear tells yet, so i’m on the fence. to break the ice, let’s each name our top suspect and why, then compare notes. parker, who are you leaning toward? charlie, what about you
[16:32:38] Parker: parker: hey charlie, thanks for getting things moving, but i’m not convinced either of us has shown real mafia vibes yet. sam, you’ve been pretty quiet – i’m going to put a soft vote on you just to get more input. what are your thoughts on charlie or me so far? and charlie, any specific reads on sam you can share? let’s hear some concrete reasons before we lock anything in
[16:32:41] Charlie: hey sam, hey parker—charlie here! super pumped to get started. since it’s our first day chat, i’m curious: do you think the most talkative player is trying to lead or divert? who feels confident to share a gut read so far
[16:32:49] Sam: hey both—i agree it’s day 1 and feels pretty random. charlie, what makes you pick parker beyond just wanting to get the ball rolling? parker, do you have any odd feelings about charlie jumping right in? i’m not seeing strong reads yet, so i’ll place a placeholder vote on charlie for now just to keep us even. let’s see what reactions we get before we lock it down
[16:32:52] Parker: i’m going to lean on charlie for now—jumping in with a placeholder vote that fast feels a bit opportunistic, could be a mafia power play to gauge reactions. sam’s a little quiet but that might just be first-day nerves. i’ll cast my vote for charlie unless something more concrete pops up—how does that sit with you, sam
[16:33:02] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[16:33:32] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Charlie
