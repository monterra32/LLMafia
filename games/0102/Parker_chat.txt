[16:32:21] Parker: hey sam, hey charlie! day 1 always feels like a bit of a coin flip, but in my experience the mafia either pushes for a quick vote or stays way too quiet. we didn’t get much of an intro—did either of you pick up on anything odd just now? i’m inclined to hang back a bit and see who starts making bold moves. what are your thoughts
[16:32:38] Parker: parker: hey charlie, thanks for getting things moving, but i’m not convinced either of us has shown real mafia vibes yet. sam, you’ve been pretty quiet – i’m going to put a soft vote on you just to get more input. what are your thoughts on charlie or me so far? and charlie, any specific reads on sam you can share? let’s hear some concrete reasons before we lock anything in
[16:32:52] Parker: i’m going to lean on charlie for now—jumping in with a placeholder vote that fast feels a bit opportunistic, could be a mafia power play to gauge reactions. sam’s a little quiet but that might just be first-day nerves. i’ll cast my vote for charlie unless something more concrete pops up—how does that sit with you, sam
