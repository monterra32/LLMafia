[16:58:02] Kennedy: hey everyone! happy day 1—looks like nobody went down overnight, so we don’t have hard info yet. let’s get the ball rolling: what gut feelings are you all getting? any tells you’ve noticed so far? feel free to call out someone or share what you’re watching for
[16:58:18] Kennedy: hey all—i get the parker silence angle, but i’m actually a bit wary of ray: nothing until the prompt, then suddenly full steam ahead to shape the convo. could be just enthusiasm, but it also reads like overcompensation. dakota, what’s your take on ray’s jump-in? and sam, do you see anything from ray that puts you more at ease? i’m happy to pivot back to parker if we’re overthinking ray here
[16:58:41] Kennedy: kennedy: i’ve got a gut read on parker—calling out “suspicious silence” when they were pretty quiet themselves feels like they’re pre-emptively steering the conversation. i’ll be watching parker closely this round. dakota, what’s your initial vibe
[16:59:12] Kennedy: parker, drilling into specifics: i noticed you stayed almost entirely silent through the first round of reads and only jumped in once sam flagged you—then you immediately asked everyone else for justification instead of offering your own take. to me that feels like someone sitting back to see which way the wind blows before committing. ray’s push to break the ice and structure our chat feels like straightforward town facilitation, not manipulation. sam’s quick call on parker was bold (even if a bit snap), at least it shows a read. dakota, do you still feel parker’s silence is strategic rather than just nerves? i’m leaning on parker right now unless someone can give me a concrete reason to shift off
[16:59:26] Kennedy: kennedy: i’m still more concerned with parker’s silence than ray’s structuring. ray at least gave us a framework to work with, but parker sat back until under fire then deflected without offering a single read of their own. that kind of avoidance feels more mafia‐y to me—though i’m keeping an eye on ray’s convener role, too
[17:01:40] Kennedy: kennedy: okay ray, dakota—we’ve lost sam overnight, so the mafia clearly felt threatened by him. sam was building a case against parker (gone) and then you, ray. with parker out of the way, it makes sense the mafia would kill sam to protect themselves—pointing at you, ray. 

ray, how do you explain this kill pattern if you’re town? dakota, do you see any other angle here? i’m leaning vote-ray unless one of you can give me a better suspect
[17:02:13] Kennedy: kennedy: hey ray, hey dakota—down to the final three, one of you is mafia. i’m going to need something more concrete than vibes. ray, share one exact line from dakota’s messages that screams mafia play and one that feels townie. dakota, then do the same for ray. once we’ve got those quotes, i’ll lock in my vote. let’s keep it quick and specific so we can wrap this up
[17:02:42] Kennedy: ray, here’s the exact moment that spooked me: you jumped in with “let’s ease in with a quick icebreaker,” steering the convo toward structure instead of actual reads—classic deflection. then sam, who was closing in on you, got killed overnight. i’m locking my vote on you, ray. dakota—any holes in that logic, or should we seal this
