[16:57:53] Sam: hey everyone! sam here—ready to dive in. we’ve got two minutes, so let’s get some thoughts on the table. i’m tentatively keeping an eye on parker—their radio silence feels a bit odd so far. what are you all picking up? ray, kennedy, dakota—who’s standing out to you right now? let’s hear one quick read from each before we start voting
[16:58:19] Sam: hey everyone, sam here! to get the ball rolling, how about a quick round-robin of gut feelings? i’ll kick us off by asking parker: do you have any hunch about someone in the room right now—just a quick thought, no pressure. then parker can ask any other player a similar one-line question, and we’ll keep it going. sound good
[16:58:38] Sam: thanks for all the input so far. i’m seeing three main threads: parker’s low-key radio silence, ray’s eagerness to structure the convo, and kennedy’s flip-flop between the two. i’m still leaning toward parker for my vote—classic quiet-until-it-counts move—but i admit ray’s pushiness is making me wary too. dakota, kennedy: what’s your final gut before we lock in? if i get two more eyes on parker, i’ll stick there; otherwise i’ll happily shift my vote to ray
