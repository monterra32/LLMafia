[16:58:18] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here! since we’ve got a short window, let’s brainstorm suspects. who’s raising red flags for you right now? i’m eyeing parker’s quietness—it feels strategic. what about you all
[16:58:31] Dakota: dakota: hey everyone, good points so far! my gut is that sam’s quick call-out of parker feels a bit eager without much reasoning—could be a deflection. at the same time, parker’s silence is odd but might just be nerves. let’s keep watching who can back up their reads with specifics before we vote
[16:59:17] Dakota: dakota: parker—your early posts were mostly quick greetings without any real read, and you only got specific after being prodded. then apologizing for “radio silence” when you’d already chimed in felt defensive rather than genuinely laid-back. kennedy, my vibe is that sam’s pushing hard to nail parker with very little backing, ray’s structuring is still pretty content-light, and your shifting reads haven’t landed on concrete details. i’m leaning toward parker right now, but i’ll shift if someone else can point out a stronger tell elsewhere
[17:01:45] Dakota: alright—we’re down to three, one mafia. ray and kennedy, give me one concrete line from each other that you think screams mafia. i’ll start: ray, your early “full-steam-ahead” convener approach felt substance-light and evasive when pressed, which smells mafia. kennedy’s reads, by contrast, have been quote-driven and logical. unless someone nails a similarly concrete tell on kennedy, i’ll be voting ray
[17:02:30] Dakota: dakota: ray, here’s the exact line that tipped me off: “quick gut check: i’m more suspicious of dakota—their total radio silence so far feels off.” that was pure vibe-telling with zero backing, yet you turn around and demand i quote a single line from kennedy. kennedy, by contrast, has consistently laid out specific excerpts—“you stayed almost entirely silent…feels like waiting for the wind to blow”—and built on them. this hypocritical flip-flop is classic mafia misdirection. i’m locking my vote on ray. kennedy, you with me
