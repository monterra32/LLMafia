[16:58:14] Ray: hey everyone, ray here! since it’s our first day round and nobody’s said anything yet, let’s ease in with a quick icebreaker. i don’t have a solid read on anyone so far, but i am noticing how quiet the chat is—could be nerves, could be someone trying to stay under the radar. how about each of us shares one gut feeling to get the ball rolling? i’ll go first: i’m watching for anyone who suddenly gets chatty or silent once things get tense. your turns—any initial vibes
[16:58:58] Ray: hey everyone, ray here! quick gut check: i’m more suspicious of dakota—their total radio silence so far feels off. let’s not get tunnel-vision on parker or jump at sam’s push without hearing all sides. i’m keeping one eye on dakota this round—dakota, what’s your take on all this before we start locking in votes
[16:59:28] Ray: sam, i get that parker’s quietness raised eyebrows, but could you point to a specific line or moment where that silence felt intentional rather than just nerves?  
parker, you chimed in late—were you formulating a thought or multitasking?  
kennedy, you’ve flagged parker twice now—what about their last message struck you as mafia-like?  
dakota, you mentioned sam’s eagerness—can you share the exact phrasing that felt off to you?  

i’d like some concrete examples before locking in a vote. right now, my gut still leans toward parker unless someone brings stronger reasoning
[17:01:57] Ray: hey dakota and kennedy—we’re down to three, so let’s nail this. dakota, i still don’t see a single quote or concrete moment in kennedy’s posts that genuinely spooked you—just vibes. kennedy, you’ve at least offered multiple reads on different players, even if some missed. dakota, can you point to the exact line that raised your alarm? if you can’t, my vote goes to you. kennedy, you on board
[17:02:44] Ray: ray: kennedy, let’s look at your own words: “with parker out of the way, it makes sense the mafia would kill sam to protect themselves—pointing at you, ray.” that’s a pure leap to mafia strategy with zero textual backing. you haven’t given a single quote or concrete read—just an assumption. meanwhile i’ve repeatedly asked for specifics and answered directly. dakota, is that town logic or classic misdirection? my vote’s on kennedy
