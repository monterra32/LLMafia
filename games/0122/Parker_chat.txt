[16:57:57] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! day 1 and so far it’s been eerily quiet. i’m watching for anyone who’s either too eager to accuse or suspiciously silent. what are your initial gut reads? who’s feeling off to you so far—ray, sam, kennedy or dakota? let’s get this conversation rolling before we make any rash votes
[16:58:18] Parker: hey sam, sorry for the radio silence—just catching up! i get why i’m on your radar, but i’m actually curious about kennedy: they’ve been awfully quiet, barely reacting to the initial chatter. could be laying low, could be genuine. ray, dakota—what vibes are you both getting from that minimal participation
[16:58:38] Parker: hey everyone, real quick—i’d love to get more concrete reads before we start voting. 

sam, you jumped straight to eyeing me—what specifically in my messages felt off?  
dakota, you flagged my silence as strategic—can you pinpoint what made it seem that way versus just being laid-back?  
ray, i appreciate you breaking the ice, but your full-steam-ahead convo steering stood out to me—anyone else think that’s a bit too on-the-nose for day 1?  
kennedy, what’s your take now that we’re drilling into specifics?

i’ll kick us off: sam, calling me out right as we opened feels a touch premature. your turn!
[16:59:37] Parker: okay, let’s break this down. nobody’s cited a single mafia tell in my posts beyond “radio silence.” sam, you jumped on me fast without a single quote or concrete reason—that looks more like deflection than a genuine read. ray, kennedy, dakota: do you really think i’ve given more evidence of mafia play than sam has of yours? if we’re lynching someone without proof, i’d rather it be the person leading the charge on zero evidence. who’s with me on reconsidering sam instead
