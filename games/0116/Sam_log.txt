## CONTENT: You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  + 
 + Do you understand the rules? +

## CONTENT: Absolutely! Here’s my understanding:

• Each player is secretly either Mafia or a Bystander.  
• Daytime: everyone discusses and votes to lynch one suspect.  
• Nighttime: the Mafia privately choose a Bystander to eliminate.  
• Mafia win if they ever equal or outnumber the Bystanders; Bystanders win by lynching all the Mafia.

Let’s do this—I’m in!

The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  
You were assigned the following role: bystander.

[16:34:14] Sam: hey everyone, sam here! with two minutes on the clock, how about we each share any gut impressions so far—tone, timing, anything that felt off? i’ll kick us off: i noticed parker was pretty quiet right when day opened—could be just thinking, but it stood out. ray? kennedy? dakota? what did you pick up on
[16:34:15] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here! day 1 and we’ve got no reads yet—how about we take a moment to chat before jumping into votes? early lynches can be risky without clues. does anyone already have gut feelings or noticed something off about how quiet or eager people are? let’s share any first impressions before we pick someone to vote on
[16:34:15] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! excited to get started. day 1 and it’s mighty quiet—everyone sizing each other up, i bet. no clues yet, but i always watch who’s first to point fingers. ray, sam, kennedy, dakota—any gut feelings so far? let’s get this conversation rolling
[16:34:17] Ray: hey everyone, ray here! day 1 and we’ve got zero clues so far. i find it helpful to watch who’s overly nervous or strangely chill in these early rounds—what do you all think? any initial gut feelings or hunches
[16:34:20] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here. first day, no one’s out yet – so let’s get things moving. how about a quick round-robin: we each drop one sentence on who feels most suspicious right now? i’ll start: parker’s been awfully quiet, and that silence stands out. sam, how about you – who are you eyeing
Do you want to send a message to the group chat now, or do you prefer to wait for now and see what messages others will send? Remember to choose to send a message only if your contribution to the discussion in the current time will be meaningful enough. Don't overflow the discussion with your messages! Pay attention to the amount of messages with your name compared to the amount of messages with names of other players and let them have their turn too! Check the speaker name in the last few messages, and decide accordingly based on whether you talked too much. Reply only with `<send>` if you want to send a message now, or only with `<wait>` if you want to wait for now, based on your decision!

[16:34:20] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here. first day, no one’s out yet – so let’s get things moving. how about a quick round-robin: we each drop one sentence on who feels most suspicious right now? i’ll start: parker’s been awfully quiet, and that silence stands out. sam, how about you – who are you eyeing
[16:34:27] Sam: alright, let’s jump in—2 minutes isn’t long. here’s a quick exercise: everyone give a one-sentence gut read—pick one person you suspect and why. i’ll go first: i’m leaning toward parker right now because they’ve been totally silent and that feels like a mafia tactic. ray, kennedy, dakota—your one-liners
[16:34:35] Dakota: hey everyone! dakota here. a few quick thoughts: i noticed parker was pretty silent right when day kicked off—could be deep in thought, or laying low. then sam jumped on that fast—could be a solid read, could be steering early. ray’s also kept quiet so far—are you sizing everyone up or holding info back? kennedy’s been asking good open questions, which feels genuine. no hard reads yet, but i’d love to hear from parker—what were you thinking in that quiet stretch? and ray, did anything about today strike you
[16:34:41] Parker: parker: hey everyone, sorry i was quiet at the start—i was just processing. on that note, sam’s quick focus on me could be a test or a deflection, not sure which yet. i also noticed ray hasn’t said much—could be lying low—and kennedy’s been radio silent. dakota, i like your call to slow down. i’m leaning toward waiting a bit longer before voting. ray, what did you pick up? kennedy, anything jump out at you in tone or timing
[16:34:46] Ray: great points, sam & dakota! i noticed parker was pretty quiet at the start, but what really caught my eye is kennedy’s total silence so far. day 1 radio silence feels a bit too safe. i’m leaning toward a soft vote on kennedy unless someone has stronger reads—kennedy, what’s your take
Do you want to send a message to the group chat now, or do you prefer to wait for now and see what messages others will send?

Pay attention to the amount of messages with your name compared to the amount of messages with names of other players and let them have their turn too! Check the speaker name in the last few messages, and decide accordingly based on whether you talked too much.

## CONTENT: Your name is Sam.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [16:34:02].
The other players in the game are:
 Ray ( unknown ) 
 Parker ( unknown ) 
 Kennedy ( unknown ) 
 Dakota ( unknown ) 
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
Ray ( unknown ) 
Parker ( unknown ) 
Kennedy ( unknown ) 
Dakota ( unknown ) 
In your response to that is shown to the user (excluding your hidden scratchpad), you can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:
<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.

[16:34:02] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[16:34:14] Sam: hey everyone, sam here! with two minutes on the clock, how about we each share any gut impressions so far—tone, timing, anything that felt off? i’ll kick us off: i noticed parker was pretty quiet right when day opened—could be just thinking, but it stood out. ray? kennedy? dakota? what did you pick up on
[16:34:15] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here! day 1 and we’ve got no reads yet—how about we take a moment to chat before jumping into votes? early lynches can be risky without clues. does anyone already have gut feelings or noticed something off about how quiet or eager people are? let’s share any first impressions before we pick someone to vote on
[16:34:15] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! excited to get started. day 1 and it’s mighty quiet—everyone sizing each other up, i bet. no clues yet, but i always watch who’s first to point fingers. ray, sam, kennedy, dakota—any gut feelings so far? let’s get this conversation rolling

[16:34:53] Sam: thanks for the prompt, kennedy! my gut right now is on parker for that minute of radio silence—could be just thinking, but i’m curious what was going through your head in those first few seconds. ray, your bit about scanning for “nervous vs chill” felt pretty broad—can you point to anything specific you caught that struck you as overly nervous or oddly calm? let’s hear those details before we start locking in votes
[16:34:54] Kennedy: kennedy: i’ll play devil’s advocate and say i’m eyeing ray—he’s been all about tone swings but hasn’t backed it up with any actual evidence
[16:34:57] Dakota: i’m leaning on ray—he’s just echoed the same vague “zero clues” line without any specific reads, which feels a bit dodge-y
[16:34:58] Parker: sorry for the quiet start—i was sizing everyone up. quick gut read: i’m eyeing sam for jumping on me so fast without much else to go on. ray, you’ve been pretty low-key too—what suspicions have you picked up

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[16:34:02] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[16:34:14] Sam: hey everyone, sam here! with two minutes on the clock, how about we each share any gut impressions so far—tone, timing, anything that felt off? i’ll kick us off: i noticed parker was pretty quiet right when day opened—could be just thinking, but it stood out. ray? kennedy? dakota? what did you pick up on
[16:34:15] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here! day 1 and we’ve got no reads yet—how about we take a moment to chat before jumping into votes? early lynches can be risky without clues. does anyone already have gut feelings or noticed something off about how quiet or eager people are? let’s share any first impressions before we pick someone to vote on
[16:34:15] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! excited to get started. day 1 and it’s mighty quiet—everyone sizing each other up, i bet. no clues yet, but i always watch who’s first to point fingers. ray, sam, kennedy, dakota—any gut feelings so far? let’s get this conversation rolling
[16:34:17] Ray: hey everyone, ray here! day 1 and we’ve got zero clues so far. i find it helpful to watch who’s overly nervous or strangely chill in these early rounds—what do you all think? any initial gut feelings or hunches
[16:34:20] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here. first day, no one’s out yet – so let’s get things moving. how about a quick round-robin: we each drop one sentence on who feels most suspicious right now? i’ll start: parker’s been awfully quiet, and that silence stands out. sam, how about you – who are you eyeing
[16:34:27] Sam: alright, let’s jump in—2 minutes isn’t long. here’s a quick exercise: everyone give a one-sentence gut read—pick one person you suspect and why. i’ll go first: i’m leaning toward parker right now because they’ve been totally silent and that feels like a mafia tactic. ray, kennedy, dakota—your one-liners
[16:34:35] Dakota: hey everyone! dakota here. a few quick thoughts: i noticed parker was pretty silent right when day kicked off—could be deep in thought, or laying low. then sam jumped on that fast—could be a solid read, could be steering early. ray’s also kept quiet so far—are you sizing everyone up or holding info back? kennedy’s been asking good open questions, which feels genuine. no hard reads yet, but i’d love to hear from parker—what were you thinking in that quiet stretch? and ray, did anything about today strike you
[16:34:41] Parker: parker: hey everyone, sorry i was quiet at the start—i was just processing. on that note, sam’s quick focus on me could be a test or a deflection, not sure which yet. i also noticed ray hasn’t said much—could be lying low—and kennedy’s been radio silent. dakota, i like your call to slow down. i’m leaning toward waiting a bit longer before voting. ray, what did you pick up? kennedy, anything jump out at you in tone or timing
[16:34:46] Ray: great points, sam & dakota! i noticed parker was pretty quiet at the start, but what really caught my eye is kennedy’s total silence so far. day 1 radio silence feels a bit too safe. i’m leaning toward a soft vote on kennedy unless someone has stronger reads—kennedy, what’s your take
[16:34:53] Sam: thanks for the prompt, kennedy! my gut right now is on parker for that minute of radio silence—could be just thinking, but i’m curious what was going through your head in those first few seconds. ray, your bit about scanning for “nervous vs chill” felt pretty broad—can you point to anything specific you caught that struck you as overly nervous or oddly calm? let’s hear those details before we start locking in votes
[16:34:54] Kennedy: kennedy: i’ll play devil’s advocate and say i’m eyeing ray—he’s been all about tone swings but hasn’t backed it up with any actual evidence
[16:34:57] Dakota: i’m leaning on ray—he’s just echoed the same vague “zero clues” line without any specific reads, which feels a bit dodge-y
[16:34:58] Parker: sorry for the quiet start—i was sizing everyone up. quick gut read: i’m eyeing sam for jumping on me so fast without much else to go on. ray, you’ve been pretty low-key too—what suspicions have you picked up
[16:35:09] Ray: hey team, thanks for the patience call, parker—i was just sizing everyone up, not plotting anything shady. what really gives me pause is sam’s eagerness to zero in on parker and kennedy’s sudden radio silence after pushing for this exercise. i’m leaning toward skipping today so we can see who starts to crack under more pressure; unless someone has a firmer read, i’ll hold my vote
[16:35:14] Dakota: all right, team—before we rush a vote i want a bit more detail from our top suspects. parker, when you say you were “just processing,” what specifically were you thinking through in those first seconds? ray, can you point to one exact line or tone shift that felt off instead of general “tone swings”? kennedy, what in ray’s messages made you flip from quiet to suspicious? let’s get those clarifications and then see whose answers hold up
Do you want to send a message to the group chat now, or do you prefer to wait for now and see what messages others will send? Remember to choose to send a message only if your contribution to the discussion in the current time will be meaningful enough. Don't overflow the discussion with your messages! Pay attention to the amount of messages with your name compared to the amount of messages with names of other players and let them have their turn too! Check the speaker name in the last few messages, and decide accordingly based on whether you talked too much. Reply only with `<send>` if you want to send a message now, or only with `<wait>` if you want to wait for now, based on your decision!

[16:35:09] Ray: hey team, thanks for the patience call, parker—i was just sizing everyone up, not plotting anything shady. what really gives me pause is sam’s eagerness to zero in on parker and kennedy’s sudden radio silence after pushing for this exercise. i’m leaning toward skipping today so we can see who starts to crack under more pressure; unless someone has a firmer read, i’ll hold my vote
[16:35:14] Dakota: all right, team—before we rush a vote i want a bit more detail from our top suspects. parker, when you say you were “just processing,” what specifically were you thinking through in those first seconds? ray, can you point to one exact line or tone shift that felt off instead of general “tone swings”? kennedy, what in ray’s messages made you flip from quiet to suspicious? let’s get those clarifications and then see whose answers hold up
[16:35:32] Kennedy: ray, i’m surprised by your call on my “radio silence”—i kicked things off immediately with that round-robin read, so i don’t see where i went overly calm. can you point to the exact moment or phrasing that felt off? meanwhile, i’m still curious about parker’s longer pause before posting—parker, what were you doing during that stretch? let’s nail down these details before casting votes

[16:34:02] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[16:34:14] Sam: hey everyone, sam here! with two minutes on the clock, how about we each share any gut impressions so far—tone, timing, anything that felt off? i’ll kick us off: i noticed parker was pretty quiet right when day opened—could be just thinking, but it stood out. ray? kennedy? dakota? what did you pick up on
[16:34:15] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here! day 1 and we’ve got no reads yet—how about we take a moment to chat before jumping into votes? early lynches can be risky without clues. does anyone already have gut feelings or noticed something off about how quiet or eager people are? let’s share any first impressions before we pick someone to vote on
[16:34:15] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! excited to get started. day 1 and it’s mighty quiet—everyone sizing each other up, i bet. no clues yet, but i always watch who’s first to point fingers. ray, sam, kennedy, dakota—any gut feelings so far? let’s get this conversation rolling
[16:34:17] Ray: hey everyone, ray here! day 1 and we’ve got zero clues so far. i find it helpful to watch who’s overly nervous or strangely chill in these early rounds—what do you all think? any initial gut feelings or hunches
[16:34:20] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here. first day, no one’s out yet – so let’s get things moving. how about a quick round-robin: we each drop one sentence on who feels most suspicious right now? i’ll start: parker’s been awfully quiet, and that silence stands out. sam, how about you – who are you eyeing
[16:34:27] Sam: alright, let’s jump in—2 minutes isn’t long. here’s a quick exercise: everyone give a one-sentence gut read—pick one person you suspect and why. i’ll go first: i’m leaning toward parker right now because they’ve been totally silent and that feels like a mafia tactic. ray, kennedy, dakota—your one-liners
[16:34:35] Dakota: hey everyone! dakota here. a few quick thoughts: i noticed parker was pretty silent right when day kicked off—could be deep in thought, or laying low. then sam jumped on that fast—could be a solid read, could be steering early. ray’s also kept quiet so far—are you sizing everyone up or holding info back? kennedy’s been asking good open questions, which feels genuine. no hard reads yet, but i’d love to hear from parker—what were you thinking in that quiet stretch? and ray, did anything about today strike you
[16:34:41] Parker: parker: hey everyone, sorry i was quiet at the start—i was just processing. on that note, sam’s quick focus on me could be a test or a deflection, not sure which yet. i also noticed ray hasn’t said much—could be lying low—and kennedy’s been radio silent. dakota, i like your call to slow down. i’m leaning toward waiting a bit longer before voting. ray, what did you pick up? kennedy, anything jump out at you in tone or timing
[16:34:46] Ray: great points, sam & dakota! i noticed parker was pretty quiet at the start, but what really caught my eye is kennedy’s total silence so far. day 1 radio silence feels a bit too safe. i’m leaning toward a soft vote on kennedy unless someone has stronger reads—kennedy, what’s your take
[16:34:53] Sam: thanks for the prompt, kennedy! my gut right now is on parker for that minute of radio silence—could be just thinking, but i’m curious what was going through your head in those first few seconds. ray, your bit about scanning for “nervous vs chill” felt pretty broad—can you point to anything specific you caught that struck you as overly nervous or oddly calm? let’s hear those details before we start locking in votes
[16:34:54] Kennedy: kennedy: i’ll play devil’s advocate and say i’m eyeing ray—he’s been all about tone swings but hasn’t backed it up with any actual evidence
[16:34:57] Dakota: i’m leaning on ray—he’s just echoed the same vague “zero clues” line without any specific reads, which feels a bit dodge-y
[16:34:58] Parker: sorry for the quiet start—i was sizing everyone up. quick gut read: i’m eyeing sam for jumping on me so fast without much else to go on. ray, you’ve been pretty low-key too—what suspicions have you picked up
[16:35:09] Ray: hey team, thanks for the patience call, parker—i was just sizing everyone up, not plotting anything shady. what really gives me pause is sam’s eagerness to zero in on parker and kennedy’s sudden radio silence after pushing for this exercise. i’m leaning toward skipping today so we can see who starts to crack under more pressure; unless someone has a firmer read, i’ll hold my vote
[16:35:14] Dakota: all right, team—before we rush a vote i want a bit more detail from our top suspects. parker, when you say you were “just processing,” what specifically were you thinking through in those first seconds? ray, can you point to one exact line or tone shift that felt off instead of general “tone swings”? kennedy, what in ray’s messages made you flip from quiet to suspicious? let’s get those clarifications and then see whose answers hold up

## CONTENT: Your name is Sam.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [16:34:02].

• Parker – in that silent minute, what exactly were you mulling over? Point to one thing in Sam’s or Dakota’s opening that had you pausing.  
• Ray – you flagged Kennedy’s “radio silence,” so quote the exact phrase in her first post that read as oddly calm.  
• Kennedy – you called out Ray’s “tone swings,” so show us the line or wording in his messages that felt off to you.

[16:35:45] Parker: sure—when i said i was “just processing,” i was watching who spoke first and what they said. sam jumped straight on me without any concrete reads, so i wanted to see if that eagerness was genuine or a setup. i also noted ray’s quick hello then silence and kennedy’s single line before switching targets. i held off to see whose story held up under more chat. now sam: what made me your first gut read instead of gathering more clues? ray: which exact phrase in my intro struck you as odd? kennedy: what in ray’s messages flipped your suspicion onto him
[16:35:53] Ray: hey everyone, i feel like we’re ping-ponging between parker and sam and then pivoting to me without much concrete to go on. kennedy, you said you’re eyeing me for “tone swings”—could you point to a specific message or phrase that seemed off? and dakota, you found my reads dodge-y—what exactly felt evasive? if no one can back up those claims with clear examples, i’m going to put my soft vote on kennedy for now. let’s see some actual evidence before locking anyone in
[16:36:02] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...

## CONTENT: Your name is Sam.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  
You were assigned the following role: bystander.

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[16:34:02] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[16:34:14] Sam: hey everyone, sam here! with two minutes on the clock, how about we each share any gut impressions so far—tone, timing, anything that felt off? i’ll kick us off: i noticed parker was pretty quiet right when day opened—could be just thinking, but it stood out. ray? kennedy? dakota? what did you pick up on
[16:34:15] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here! day 1 and we’ve got no reads yet—how about we take a moment to chat before jumping into votes? early lynches can be risky without clues. does anyone already have gut feelings or noticed something off about how quiet or eager people are? let’s share any first impressions before we pick someone to vote on
[16:34:15] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! excited to get started. day 1 and it’s mighty quiet—everyone sizing each other up, i bet. no clues yet, but i always watch who’s first to point fingers. ray, sam, kennedy, dakota—any gut feelings so far? let’s get this conversation rolling
[16:34:17] Ray: hey everyone, ray here! day 1 and we’ve got zero clues so far. i find it helpful to watch who’s overly nervous or strangely chill in these early rounds—what do you all think? any initial gut feelings or hunches
[16:34:20] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here. first day, no one’s out yet – so let’s get things moving. how about a quick round-robin: we each drop one sentence on who feels most suspicious right now? i’ll start: parker’s been awfully quiet, and that silence stands out. sam, how about you – who are you eyeing
[16:34:27] Sam: alright, let’s jump in—2 minutes isn’t long. here’s a quick exercise: everyone give a one-sentence gut read—pick one person you suspect and why. i’ll go first: i’m leaning toward parker right now because they’ve been totally silent and that feels like a mafia tactic. ray, kennedy, dakota—your one-liners
[16:34:35] Dakota: hey everyone! dakota here. a few quick thoughts: i noticed parker was pretty silent right when day kicked off—could be deep in thought, or laying low. then sam jumped on that fast—could be a solid read, could be steering early. ray’s also kept quiet so far—are you sizing everyone up or holding info back? kennedy’s been asking good open questions, which feels genuine. no hard reads yet, but i’d love to hear from parker—what were you thinking in that quiet stretch? and ray, did anything about today strike you
[16:34:41] Parker: parker: hey everyone, sorry i was quiet at the start—i was just processing. on that note, sam’s quick focus on me could be a test or a deflection, not sure which yet. i also noticed ray hasn’t said much—could be lying low—and kennedy’s been radio silent. dakota, i like your call to slow down. i’m leaning toward waiting a bit longer before voting. ray, what did you pick up? kennedy, anything jump out at you in tone or timing
[16:34:46] Ray: great points, sam & dakota! i noticed parker was pretty quiet at the start, but what really caught my eye is kennedy’s total silence so far. day 1 radio silence feels a bit too safe. i’m leaning toward a soft vote on kennedy unless someone has stronger reads—kennedy, what’s your take
[16:34:53] Sam: thanks for the prompt, kennedy! my gut right now is on parker for that minute of radio silence—could be just thinking, but i’m curious what was going through your head in those first few seconds. ray, your bit about scanning for “nervous vs chill” felt pretty broad—can you point to anything specific you caught that struck you as overly nervous or oddly calm? let’s hear those details before we start locking in votes
[16:34:54] Kennedy: kennedy: i’ll play devil’s advocate and say i’m eyeing ray—he’s been all about tone swings but hasn’t backed it up with any actual evidence
[16:34:57] Dakota: i’m leaning on ray—he’s just echoed the same vague “zero clues” line without any specific reads, which feels a bit dodge-y
[16:34:58] Parker: sorry for the quiet start—i was sizing everyone up. quick gut read: i’m eyeing sam for jumping on me so fast without much else to go on. ray, you’ve been pretty low-key too—what suspicions have you picked up
[16:35:09] Ray: hey team, thanks for the patience call, parker—i was just sizing everyone up, not plotting anything shady. what really gives me pause is sam’s eagerness to zero in on parker and kennedy’s sudden radio silence after pushing for this exercise. i’m leaning toward skipping today so we can see who starts to crack under more pressure; unless someone has a firmer read, i’ll hold my vote
[16:35:14] Dakota: all right, team—before we rush a vote i want a bit more detail from our top suspects. parker, when you say you were “just processing,” what specifically were you thinking through in those first seconds? ray, can you point to one exact line or tone shift that felt off instead of general “tone swings”? kennedy, what in ray’s messages made you flip from quiet to suspicious? let’s get those clarifications and then see whose answers hold up
