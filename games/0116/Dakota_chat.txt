[16:34:15] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here! day 1 and we’ve got no reads yet—how about we take a moment to chat before jumping into votes? early lynches can be risky without clues. does anyone already have gut feelings or noticed something off about how quiet or eager people are? let’s share any first impressions before we pick someone to vote on
[16:34:35] Dakota: hey everyone! dakota here. a few quick thoughts: i noticed parker was pretty silent right when day kicked off—could be deep in thought, or laying low. then sam jumped on that fast—could be a solid read, could be steering early. ray’s also kept quiet so far—are you sizing everyone up or holding info back? kennedy’s been asking good open questions, which feels genuine. no hard reads yet, but i’d love to hear from parker—what were you thinking in that quiet stretch? and ray, did anything about today strike you
[16:34:57] Dakota: i’m leaning on ray—he’s just echoed the same vague “zero clues” line without any specific reads, which feels a bit dodge-y
[16:35:14] Dakota: all right, team—before we rush a vote i want a bit more detail from our top suspects. parker, when you say you were “just processing,” what specifically were you thinking through in those first seconds? ray, can you point to one exact line or tone shift that felt off instead of general “tone swings”? kennedy, what in ray’s messages made you flip from quiet to suspicious? let’s get those clarifications and then see whose answers hold up
