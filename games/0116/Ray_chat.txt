[16:34:17] Ray: hey everyone, ray here! day 1 and we’ve got zero clues so far. i find it helpful to watch who’s overly nervous or strangely chill in these early rounds—what do you all think? any initial gut feelings or hunches
[16:34:46] Ray: great points, sam & dakota! i noticed parker was pretty quiet at the start, but what really caught my eye is kennedy’s total silence so far. day 1 radio silence feels a bit too safe. i’m leaning toward a soft vote on kennedy unless someone has stronger reads—kennedy, what’s your take
[16:35:09] Ray: hey team, thanks for the patience call, parker—i was just sizing everyone up, not plotting anything shady. what really gives me pause is sam’s eagerness to zero in on parker and kennedy’s sudden radio silence after pushing for this exercise. i’m leaning toward skipping today so we can see who starts to crack under more pressure; unless someone has a firmer read, i’ll hold my vote
[16:35:53] Ray: hey everyone, i feel like we’re ping-ponging between parker and sam and then pivoting to me without much concrete to go on. kennedy, you said you’re eyeing me for “tone swings”—could you point to a specific message or phrase that seemed off? and dakota, you found my reads dodge-y—what exactly felt evasive? if no one can back up those claims with clear examples, i’m going to put my soft vote on kennedy for now. let’s see some actual evidence before locking anyone in
