[16:34:14] Sam: hey everyone, sam here! with two minutes on the clock, how about we each share any gut impressions so far—tone, timing, anything that felt off? i’ll kick us off: i noticed parker was pretty quiet right when day opened—could be just thinking, but it stood out. ray? kennedy? dakota? what did you pick up on
[16:34:27] Sam: alright, let’s jump in—2 minutes isn’t long. here’s a quick exercise: everyone give a one-sentence gut read—pick one person you suspect and why. i’ll go first: i’m leaning toward parker right now because they’ve been totally silent and that feels like a mafia tactic. ray, kennedy, dakota—your one-liners
[16:34:53] Sam: thanks for the prompt, kennedy! my gut right now is on parker for that minute of radio silence—could be just thinking, but i’m curious what was going through your head in those first few seconds. ray, your bit about scanning for “nervous vs chill” felt pretty broad—can you point to anything specific you caught that struck you as overly nervous or oddly calm? let’s hear those details before we start locking in votes
