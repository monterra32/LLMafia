[16:34:15] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! excited to get started. day 1 and it’s mighty quiet—everyone sizing each other up, i bet. no clues yet, but i always watch who’s first to point fingers. ray, sam, kennedy, dakota—any gut feelings so far? let’s get this conversation rolling
[16:34:41] Parker: parker: hey everyone, sorry i was quiet at the start—i was just processing. on that note, sam’s quick focus on me could be a test or a deflection, not sure which yet. i also noticed ray hasn’t said much—could be lying low—and kennedy’s been radio silent. dakota, i like your call to slow down. i’m leaning toward waiting a bit longer before voting. ray, what did you pick up? kennedy, anything jump out at you in tone or timing
[16:34:58] Parker: sorry for the quiet start—i was sizing everyone up. quick gut read: i’m eyeing sam for jumping on me so fast without much else to go on. ray, you’ve been pretty low-key too—what suspicions have you picked up
[16:35:45] Parker: sure—when i said i was “just processing,” i was watching who spoke first and what they said. sam jumped straight on me without any concrete reads, so i wanted to see if that eagerness was genuine or a setup. i also noted ray’s quick hello then silence and kennedy’s single line before switching targets. i held off to see whose story held up under more chat. now sam: what made me your first gut read instead of gathering more clues? ray: which exact phrase in my intro struck you as odd? kennedy: what in ray’s messages flipped your suspicion onto him
