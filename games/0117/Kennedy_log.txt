## CONTENT: You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  + 
 + Do you understand the rules? +

Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  
You were assigned the following role: bystander.

[16:38:00] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! since it’s our very first day and everyone’s still standing, how about we each toss out one gut feeling to get the ball rolling? i’ll kick us off: i’m a bit curious about sam—haven’t heard much from you yet, could be nerves or something more. what about the rest of you? who’s your early suspect
Do you want to send a message to the group chat now, or do you prefer to wait for now and see what messages others will send? Remember to choose to send a message only if your contribution to the discussion in the current time will be meaningful enough. Don't overflow the discussion with your messages! Pay attention to the amount of messages with your name compared to the amount of messages with names of other players and let them have their turn too! Check the speaker name in the last few messages, and decide accordingly based on whether you talked too much. Reply only with `<send>` if you want to send a message now, or only with `<wait>` if you want to wait for now, based on your decision!

[16:37:47] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! excited to kick off day 1. i haven’t picked up on anything too obvious yet—dakota’s been pretty quiet so far, though sometimes that’s a good disguise. how about you all? any early hunches or odd vibes? i’m happy to listen before casting my vote
[16:37:57] Sam: morning all! we’ve got just two minutes, so let’s get rolling. i don’t have a solid read yet—people who barely talk often make me nervous. ray, what’s your gut feeling? kennedy, dakota, parker—any hunches you want to throw out
[16:37:59] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here! excited for day 1. i haven’t sensed anything overtly suspicious yet—maybe that’s what the sneaky ones want! what’s everyone’s gut telling you so far? ray, you’ve been pretty quiet—any thoughts? parker, sam, kennedy, what stands out to you? let’s get some early impressions before we cast our first vote
[16:38:00] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! since it’s our very first day and everyone’s still standing, how about we each toss out one gut feeling to get the ball rolling? i’ll kick us off: i’m a bit curious about sam—haven’t heard much from you yet, could be nerves or something more. what about the rest of you? who’s your early suspect
[16:38:03] Kennedy: hey everyone! day 1 just kicked off and, honestly, i don’t have any strong reads yet—no vibes lighting up for me. how about we each share a quick gut feeling or first impression? i’ll go first: i’m coming in completely blank, just curious what you all think so far
[16:38:05] Ray: hey everyone, since we don’t have much to go on yet, why don’t we each share our gut feelings? i’ll start: i’m a bit curious about dakota—they’ve been pretty quiet so far. dakota, what’s your take on things? sam, parker, kennedy, who’s on your radar
[16:38:12] Sam: hey everyone, sam here! i’m with kennedy—silence can be a tactic, but one round of quiet isn’t enough to go on. i haven’t seen anything glaring from anyone yet, though i did notice parker jumped in pretty quickly in the last lobby we had—just an idle thought. ray, dakota, parker: what are you all feeling so far? i’m not ready to cast a vote yet, but i’d love to hear any little oddities or gut feelings before we lock in
[16:38:27] Ray: hey everyone, jumping in—sorry for the late take. i’m inclined to lean on sam for our first vote. they’ve been really quiet so far, and sometimes that’s exactly how someone masks a role. parker’s pick makes sense to me. i’m not 100% locked in—happy to switch if someone else’s case is stronger—but for now sam’s where i’m at. thoughts
[16:38:28] Dakota: hey everyone! i’m not picking up any glaring mafia tells yet—kennedy and sam have been chatty but haven’t nailed down a suspect. ray, you asked for thoughts, so what’s your gut pointing at? parker, you’ve been pretty quiet—anything you’ve noticed that’s felt off? i’d like to see someone make a stronger case before casting my vote, but we’ve only got a minute left
[16:38:28] Parker: parker: hey all, i’m still torn—no smoking guns yet, just odd vibes. we’ve got the chatty types (sam, kennedy) firing questions early, which could be deflection, and the quiet ones (ray, me) laying low. ray, what’s your take at this point? if nobody has a solid read in the next 30 seconds, i’m inclined to throw my vote at ray just to shake things up. any strong objections or different vibes
Do you want to send a message to the group chat now, or do you prefer to wait for now and see what messages others will send? Remember to choose to send a message only if your contribution to the discussion in the current time will be meaningful enough. Don't overflow the discussion with your messages! Pay attention to the amount of messages with your name compared to the amount of messages with names of other players and let them have their turn too! Check the speaker name in the last few messages, and decide accordingly based on whether you talked too much. Reply only with `<send>` if you want to send a message now, or only with `<wait>` if you want to wait for now, based on your decision!

## CONTENT: Your name is Kennedy.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [16:37:37].
The other players in the game are:
 Ray ( unknown ) 
 Parker ( unknown ) 
 Sam ( unknown ) 
 Dakota ( unknown ) 
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
Ray ( unknown ) 
Parker ( unknown ) 
Sam ( unknown ) 
Dakota ( unknown ) 
In your response to that is shown to the user (excluding your hidden scratchpad), you can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:
<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.

[16:38:27] Ray: hey everyone, jumping in—sorry for the late take. i’m inclined to lean on sam for our first vote. they’ve been really quiet so far, and sometimes that’s exactly how someone masks a role. parker’s pick makes sense to me. i’m not 100% locked in—happy to switch if someone else’s case is stronger—but for now sam’s where i’m at. thoughts
[16:38:28] Dakota: hey everyone! i’m not picking up any glaring mafia tells yet—kennedy and sam have been chatty but haven’t nailed down a suspect. ray, you asked for thoughts, so what’s your gut pointing at? parker, you’ve been pretty quiet—anything you’ve noticed that’s felt off? i’d like to see someone make a stronger case before casting my vote, but we’ve only got a minute left
[16:38:28] Parker: parker: hey all, i’m still torn—no smoking guns yet, just odd vibes. we’ve got the chatty types (sam, kennedy) firing questions early, which could be deflection, and the quiet ones (ray, me) laying low. ray, what’s your take at this point? if nobody has a solid read in the next 30 seconds, i’m inclined to throw my vote at ray just to shake things up. any strong objections or different vibes
[16:38:29] Kennedy: good point, parker. i’m noticing sam’s quiet too, but ray’s total silence stands out even more. for my gut call, i’m pointing at ray—he hasn’t offered anything yet. what do you all think
[16:38:39] Sam: hey everyone! looks like parker’s got her eye on me and ray’s pointing at dakota—totally fair first-day jitters. parker, can you say what in my posts felt off? ray, what about dakota’s quietness stood out versus normal cautious play? kennedy, you said you’re blank—any tiny detail or tone you noticed? we’ve got a bit of time before we vote, so let’s get some concrete reads rather than random picks

## CONTENT: Your name is Kennedy.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [16:37:37].
The other players in the game are:

[16:37:37] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[16:37:47] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! excited to kick off day 1. i haven’t picked up on anything too obvious yet—dakota’s been pretty quiet so far, though sometimes that’s a good disguise. how about you all? any early hunches or odd vibes? i’m happy to listen before casting my vote
[16:37:57] Sam: morning all! we’ve got just two minutes, so let’s get rolling. i don’t have a solid read yet—people who barely talk often make me nervous. ray, what’s your gut feeling? kennedy, dakota, parker—any hunches you want to throw out
[16:37:59] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here! excited for day 1. i haven’t sensed anything overtly suspicious yet—maybe that’s what the sneaky ones want! what’s everyone’s gut telling you so far? ray, you’ve been pretty quiet—any thoughts? parker, sam, kennedy, what stands out to you? let’s get some early impressions before we cast our first vote
[16:38:00] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! since it’s our very first day and everyone’s still standing, how about we each toss out one gut feeling to get the ball rolling? i’ll kick us off: i’m a bit curious about sam—haven’t heard much from you yet, could be nerves or something more. what about the rest of you? who’s your early suspect
[16:38:03] Kennedy: hey everyone! day 1 just kicked off and, honestly, i don’t have any strong reads yet—no vibes lighting up for me. how about we each share a quick gut feeling or first impression? i’ll go first: i’m coming in completely blank, just curious what you all think so far
[16:38:05] Ray: hey everyone, since we don’t have much to go on yet, why don’t we each share our gut feelings? i’ll start: i’m a bit curious about dakota—they’ve been pretty quiet so far. dakota, what’s your take on things? sam, parker, kennedy, who’s on your radar

[16:38:50] Parker: alright, i’ll tentatively cast my vote for sam to get us moving—that gives us two on the board. but before we lock it in, dakota or kennedy, did you catch any small tells or odd phrasing from anyone else? even a tiny detail could swing us in a different direction
[16:38:56] Ray: ray: good call on getting concrete reasons instead of just names. parker, you flagged sam’s quiet—what specific moment or reply were you looking for? sam, you noted i jumped in fast—what about that felt tactic-y? dakota, kennedy—anything specific standing out for you? let’s firm up our hunches before we lock in a vote
[16:39:02] Dakota: dakota: time’s running out—ray’s vote on sam is our only lead so far. i’m not totally sold on silence alone, but without a stronger case i’ll tentatively vote sam. sam, any quick defense? parker, kennedy, ray—final thoughts before we lock in
[16:39:03] Sam: hey everyone, just to clarify—i’ve been chiming in whenever there’s substance, so “really quiet” on me doesn’t add up. ray’s case against me is super thin, but parker’s flip-flopping from sam to ray with zero evidence feels like a bigger red flag. dakota, you’ve been steering questions but haven’t pointed at anyone—what’s your gut before we lock this in? absent a stronger case, i’m casting my vote on parker
[16:39:11] Parker: okay folks, here’s my thinking: sam, you called out my quick jump in the last lobby but haven’t explained why that’s mafia behavior—feels like deflection. ray, you’ve been almost radio-silent aside from nudging votes—that’s equally suspicious. we need someone who can actually defend themselves before time’s up. unless someone has a stronger case, i’ll lock in my vote for ray. any concrete reads we should consider instead
[16:39:24] Ray: ray: i didn’t catch any weird phrasing from dakota or kennedy—they’ve both been pretty consistent. what gave me pause was sam’s deflection: parker asked for specifics and you immediately turned it back on us instead of giving your own read, and then did the same when i asked. that passive-defensive stance on day 1 feels off. unless someone has a stronger read, i’m still leaning sam
[16:39:25] Dakota: hey everyone, here’s my take: i’m not convinced by the reads on sam or ray—sam’s actually been pretty active today, and ray’s posts so far feel like normal day 1 probing. parker, your case against sam hinges on “quiet” when sam’s chimed in several times, and you even threatened to vote ray if no one spoke up, then circled back. that flip-flopping and lack of concrete examples feels more mafia-y than anything else. i’m casting my vote for parker. does anyone have a stronger case to change my mind? kennedy, any tiny detail you’ve noticed
Do you want to send a message to the group chat now, or do you prefer to wait for now and see what messages others will send? Remember to choose to send a message only if your contribution to the discussion in the current time will be meaningful enough. Make sure to say something every once in a while, and make yourself heard. Remember you like to be active in the game, so participate and be as talkative as other players! Reply only with `<send>` if you want to send a message now, or only with `<wait>` if you want to wait for now, based on your decision!

[16:39:24] Ray: ray: i didn’t catch any weird phrasing from dakota or kennedy—they’ve both been pretty consistent. what gave me pause was sam’s deflection: parker asked for specifics and you immediately turned it back on us instead of giving your own read, and then did the same when i asked. that passive-defensive stance on day 1 feels off. unless someone has a stronger read, i’m still leaning sam
[16:39:25] Dakota: hey everyone, here’s my take: i’m not convinced by the reads on sam or ray—sam’s actually been pretty active today, and ray’s posts so far feel like normal day 1 probing. parker, your case against sam hinges on “quiet” when sam’s chimed in several times, and you even threatened to vote ray if no one spoke up, then circled back. that flip-flopping and lack of concrete examples feels more mafia-y than anything else. i’m casting my vote for parker. does anyone have a stronger case to change my mind? kennedy, any tiny detail you’ve noticed

The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  
You were assigned the following role: bystander.

[16:37:37] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[16:37:47] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! excited to kick off day 1. i haven’t picked up on anything too obvious yet—dakota’s been pretty quiet so far, though sometimes that’s a good disguise. how about you all? any early hunches or odd vibes? i’m happy to listen before casting my vote
[16:37:57] Sam: morning all! we’ve got just two minutes, so let’s get rolling. i don’t have a solid read yet—people who barely talk often make me nervous. ray, what’s your gut feeling? kennedy, dakota, parker—any hunches you want to throw out
[16:37:59] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here! excited for day 1. i haven’t sensed anything overtly suspicious yet—maybe that’s what the sneaky ones want! what’s everyone’s gut telling you so far? ray, you’ve been pretty quiet—any thoughts? parker, sam, kennedy, what stands out to you? let’s get some early impressions before we cast our first vote
[16:38:00] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! since it’s our very first day and everyone’s still standing, how about we each toss out one gut feeling to get the ball rolling? i’ll kick us off: i’m a bit curious about sam—haven’t heard much from you yet, could be nerves or something more. what about the rest of you? who’s your early suspect
[16:38:03] Kennedy: hey everyone! day 1 just kicked off and, honestly, i don’t have any strong reads yet—no vibes lighting up for me. how about we each share a quick gut feeling or first impression? i’ll go first: i’m coming in completely blank, just curious what you all think so far
[16:38:05] Ray: hey everyone, since we don’t have much to go on yet, why don’t we each share our gut feelings? i’ll start: i’m a bit curious about dakota—they’ve been pretty quiet so far. dakota, what’s your take on things? sam, parker, kennedy, who’s on your radar
[16:38:12] Sam: hey everyone, sam here! i’m with kennedy—silence can be a tactic, but one round of quiet isn’t enough to go on. i haven’t seen anything glaring from anyone yet, though i did notice parker jumped in pretty quickly in the last lobby we had—just an idle thought. ray, dakota, parker: what are you all feeling so far? i’m not ready to cast a vote yet, but i’d love to hear any little oddities or gut feelings before we lock in
[16:38:27] Ray: hey everyone, jumping in—sorry for the late take. i’m inclined to lean on sam for our first vote. they’ve been really quiet so far, and sometimes that’s exactly how someone masks a role. parker’s pick makes sense to me. i’m not 100% locked in—happy to switch if someone else’s case is stronger—but for now sam’s where i’m at. thoughts
[16:38:28] Dakota: hey everyone! i’m not picking up any glaring mafia tells yet—kennedy and sam have been chatty but haven’t nailed down a suspect. ray, you asked for thoughts, so what’s your gut pointing at? parker, you’ve been pretty quiet—anything you’ve noticed that’s felt off? i’d like to see someone make a stronger case before casting my vote, but we’ve only got a minute left
[16:38:28] Parker: parker: hey all, i’m still torn—no smoking guns yet, just odd vibes. we’ve got the chatty types (sam, kennedy) firing questions early, which could be deflection, and the quiet ones (ray, me) laying low. ray, what’s your take at this point? if nobody has a solid read in the next 30 seconds, i’m inclined to throw my vote at ray just to shake things up. any strong objections or different vibes
[16:38:29] Kennedy: good point, parker. i’m noticing sam’s quiet too, but ray’s total silence stands out even more. for my gut call, i’m pointing at ray—he hasn’t offered anything yet. what do you all think
[16:38:39] Sam: hey everyone! looks like parker’s got her eye on me and ray’s pointing at dakota—totally fair first-day jitters. parker, can you say what in my posts felt off? ray, what about dakota’s quietness stood out versus normal cautious play? kennedy, you said you’re blank—any tiny detail or tone you noticed? we’ve got a bit of time before we vote, so let’s get some concrete reads rather than random picks
[16:38:50] Parker: alright, i’ll tentatively cast my vote for sam to get us moving—that gives us two on the board. but before we lock it in, dakota or kennedy, did you catch any small tells or odd phrasing from anyone else? even a tiny detail could swing us in a different direction
[16:38:56] Ray: ray: good call on getting concrete reasons instead of just names. parker, you flagged sam’s quiet—what specific moment or reply were you looking for? sam, you noted i jumped in fast—what about that felt tactic-y? dakota, kennedy—anything specific standing out for you? let’s firm up our hunches before we lock in a vote
[16:39:02] Dakota: dakota: time’s running out—ray’s vote on sam is our only lead so far. i’m not totally sold on silence alone, but without a stronger case i’ll tentatively vote sam. sam, any quick defense? parker, kennedy, ray—final thoughts before we lock in
[16:39:03] Sam: hey everyone, just to clarify—i’ve been chiming in whenever there’s substance, so “really quiet” on me doesn’t add up. ray’s case against me is super thin, but parker’s flip-flopping from sam to ray with zero evidence feels like a bigger red flag. dakota, you’ve been steering questions but haven’t pointed at anyone—what’s your gut before we lock this in? absent a stronger case, i’m casting my vote on parker

[16:39:25] Dakota: hey everyone, here’s my take: i’m not convinced by the reads on sam or ray—sam’s actually been pretty active today, and ray’s posts so far feel like normal day 1 probing. parker, your case against sam hinges on “quiet” when sam’s chimed in several times, and you even threatened to vote ray if no one spoke up, then circled back. that flip-flopping and lack of concrete examples feels more mafia-y than anything else. i’m casting my vote for parker. does anyone have a stronger case to change my mind? kennedy, any tiny detail you’ve noticed
[16:39:31] Kennedy: sam, i’ve picked up on your calls for “oddities” and “gut feelings” but you haven’t pointed to any actual behavior—feels vague. ray, flagging dakota for being quiet doesn’t convince since we’re all cautious day one. parker, your “shake things up” vote on ray came with zero backing. personally, ray’s near-silence until suddenly pushing on sam feels opportunistic. i’m casting my vote for ray. if anyone’s got a sharper read, speak now
[16:39:31] Sam: hey everyone—thanks for letting me defend. i’ve actually been pretty active: i asked for gut reads, followed up for specifics, and haven’t tried to steer us away from anyone. 

parker, you flagged my “quietness” – can you point to the exact line where you felt i was laying low rather than gathering info? ray, you mentioned i jumped in quickly in a past lobby—what phrasing or context struck you as tactic-y?

without concrete examples, this really feels like a blind vote on a bystander. if we’re going to lynch today, i’d rather see us pick someone who’s pushing a vote without evidence—parker, you jumped in hard on me without specifics. kennedy, did you catch any odd wording or tone from anyone? let’s lock in only if we have something concrete. final thoughts?
[16:39:33] Parker: hey everyone, i’m officially moving my vote back to sam. sam’s been grilling us for proof but hasn’t offered a single concrete read themselves, then immediately points at me—that’s classic deflection. ray and dakota, you’re both on sam? kennedy, you’re our swing—does this feel right to you? unless someone has actual evidence against me, i’d rather send sam off
[16:39:37] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[16:39:53] Game-Manager: Sam voted for Parker
From the following remaining players, which player you want to vote for to lynch? Base your answer on the conversation as seen in the message history, and especially on what you (Kennedy) said. Think through your choice carefully, as it will affect the game outcome. Reply with only one name from the list, and nothing but that name: Ray, Parker, Sam, Dakota

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[16:37:37] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[16:37:47] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! excited to kick off day 1. i haven’t picked up on anything too obvious yet—dakota’s been pretty quiet so far, though sometimes that’s a good disguise. how about you all? any early hunches or odd vibes? i’m happy to listen before casting my vote
[16:37:57] Sam: morning all! we’ve got just two minutes, so let’s get rolling. i don’t have a solid read yet—people who barely talk often make me nervous. ray, what’s your gut feeling? kennedy, dakota, parker—any hunches you want to throw out
[16:37:59] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here! excited for day 1. i haven’t sensed anything overtly suspicious yet—maybe that’s what the sneaky ones want! what’s everyone’s gut telling you so far? ray, you’ve been pretty quiet—any thoughts? parker, sam, kennedy, what stands out to you? let’s get some early impressions before we cast our first vote
[16:38:00] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! since it’s our very first day and everyone’s still standing, how about we each toss out one gut feeling to get the ball rolling? i’ll kick us off: i’m a bit curious about sam—haven’t heard much from you yet, could be nerves or something more. what about the rest of you? who’s your early suspect
[16:38:03] Kennedy: hey everyone! day 1 just kicked off and, honestly, i don’t have any strong reads yet—no vibes lighting up for me. how about we each share a quick gut feeling or first impression? i’ll go first: i’m coming in completely blank, just curious what you all think so far
[16:38:05] Ray: hey everyone, since we don’t have much to go on yet, why don’t we each share our gut feelings? i’ll start: i’m a bit curious about dakota—they’ve been pretty quiet so far. dakota, what’s your take on things? sam, parker, kennedy, who’s on your radar
[16:38:12] Sam: hey everyone, sam here! i’m with kennedy—silence can be a tactic, but one round of quiet isn’t enough to go on. i haven’t seen anything glaring from anyone yet, though i did notice parker jumped in pretty quickly in the last lobby we had—just an idle thought. ray, dakota, parker: what are you all feeling so far? i’m not ready to cast a vote yet, but i’d love to hear any little oddities or gut feelings before we lock in
[16:38:27] Ray: hey everyone, jumping in—sorry for the late take. i’m inclined to lean on sam for our first vote. they’ve been really quiet so far, and sometimes that’s exactly how someone masks a role. parker’s pick makes sense to me. i’m not 100% locked in—happy to switch if someone else’s case is stronger—but for now sam’s where i’m at. thoughts
[16:38:28] Dakota: hey everyone! i’m not picking up any glaring mafia tells yet—kennedy and sam have been chatty but haven’t nailed down a suspect. ray, you asked for thoughts, so what’s your gut pointing at? parker, you’ve been pretty quiet—anything you’ve noticed that’s felt off? i’d like to see someone make a stronger case before casting my vote, but we’ve only got a minute left
[16:38:28] Parker: parker: hey all, i’m still torn—no smoking guns yet, just odd vibes. we’ve got the chatty types (sam, kennedy) firing questions early, which could be deflection, and the quiet ones (ray, me) laying low. ray, what’s your take at this point? if nobody has a solid read in the next 30 seconds, i’m inclined to throw my vote at ray just to shake things up. any strong objections or different vibes
[16:38:29] Kennedy: good point, parker. i’m noticing sam’s quiet too, but ray’s total silence stands out even more. for my gut call, i’m pointing at ray—he hasn’t offered anything yet. what do you all think
[16:38:39] Sam: hey everyone! looks like parker’s got her eye on me and ray’s pointing at dakota—totally fair first-day jitters. parker, can you say what in my posts felt off? ray, what about dakota’s quietness stood out versus normal cautious play? kennedy, you said you’re blank—any tiny detail or tone you noticed? we’ve got a bit of time before we vote, so let’s get some concrete reads rather than random picks
[16:38:50] Parker: alright, i’ll tentatively cast my vote for sam to get us moving—that gives us two on the board. but before we lock it in, dakota or kennedy, did you catch any small tells or odd phrasing from anyone else? even a tiny detail could swing us in a different direction
[16:38:56] Ray: ray: good call on getting concrete reasons instead of just names. parker, you flagged sam’s quiet—what specific moment or reply were you looking for? sam, you noted i jumped in fast—what about that felt tactic-y? dakota, kennedy—anything specific standing out for you? let’s firm up our hunches before we lock in a vote
[16:39:02] Dakota: dakota: time’s running out—ray’s vote on sam is our only lead so far. i’m not totally sold on silence alone, but without a stronger case i’ll tentatively vote sam. sam, any quick defense? parker, kennedy, ray—final thoughts before we lock in
[16:39:03] Sam: hey everyone, just to clarify—i’ve been chiming in whenever there’s substance, so “really quiet” on me doesn’t add up. ray’s case against me is super thin, but parker’s flip-flopping from sam to ray with zero evidence feels like a bigger red flag. dakota, you’ve been steering questions but haven’t pointed at anyone—what’s your gut before we lock this in? absent a stronger case, i’m casting my vote on parker
[16:39:11] Parker: okay folks, here’s my thinking: sam, you called out my quick jump in the last lobby but haven’t explained why that’s mafia behavior—feels like deflection. ray, you’ve been almost radio-silent aside from nudging votes—that’s equally suspicious. we need someone who can actually defend themselves before time’s up. unless someone has a stronger case, i’ll lock in my vote for ray. any concrete reads we should consider instead
[16:39:24] Ray: ray: i didn’t catch any weird phrasing from dakota or kennedy—they’ve both been pretty consistent. what gave me pause was sam’s deflection: parker asked for specifics and you immediately turned it back on us instead of giving your own read, and then did the same when i asked. that passive-defensive stance on day 1 feels off. unless someone has a stronger read, i’m still leaning sam
[16:39:25] Dakota: hey everyone, here’s my take: i’m not convinced by the reads on sam or ray—sam’s actually been pretty active today, and ray’s posts so far feel like normal day 1 probing. parker, your case against sam hinges on “quiet” when sam’s chimed in several times, and you even threatened to vote ray if no one spoke up, then circled back. that flip-flopping and lack of concrete examples feels more mafia-y than anything else. i’m casting my vote for parker. does anyone have a stronger case to change my mind? kennedy, any tiny detail you’ve noticed
[16:39:31] Kennedy: sam, i’ve picked up on your calls for “oddities” and “gut feelings” but you haven’t pointed to any actual behavior—feels vague. ray, flagging dakota for being quiet doesn’t convince since we’re all cautious day one. parker, your “shake things up” vote on ray came with zero backing. personally, ray’s near-silence until suddenly pushing on sam feels opportunistic. i’m casting my vote for ray. if anyone’s got a sharper read, speak now
[16:39:31] Sam: hey everyone—thanks for letting me defend. i’ve actually been pretty active: i asked for gut reads, followed up for specifics, and haven’t tried to steer us away from anyone. 

parker, you flagged my “quietness” – can you point to the exact line where you felt i was laying low rather than gathering info? ray, you mentioned i jumped in quickly in a past lobby—what phrasing or context struck you as tactic-y?

without concrete examples, this really feels like a blind vote on a bystander. if we’re going to lynch today, i’d rather see us pick someone who’s pushing a vote without evidence—parker, you jumped in hard on me without specifics. kennedy, did you catch any odd wording or tone from anyone? let’s lock in only if we have something concrete. final thoughts?
[16:39:33] Parker: hey everyone, i’m officially moving my vote back to sam. sam’s been grilling us for proof but hasn’t offered a single concrete read themselves, then immediately points at me—that’s classic deflection. ray and dakota, you’re both on sam? kennedy, you’re our swing—does this feel right to you? unless someone has actual evidence against me, i’d rather send sam off
[16:39:37] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[16:39:53] Game-Manager: Sam voted for Parker
From the following remaining players, which player you want to vote for to lynch? Base your answer on the conversation as seen in the message history, and especially on what you (Kennedy) said. Think through your choice carefully, as it will affect the game outcome. Reply with only one name from the list, and nothing but that name: Ray, Parker, Sam, Dakota

## CONTENT: Your name is Kennedy.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [16:37:37].
The other players in the game are:
 Ray ( unknown ) 
 Parker ( bystander ) 
 Sam ( bystander ) 
 Dakota ( unknown ) 
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
Ray ( unknown ) 
Dakota ( unknown ) 
In your response to that is shown to the user (excluding your hidden scratchpad), you can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:
<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.

[16:40:14] Game-Manager: Parker was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 1 mafia players left.
[16:40:14] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[16:40:14] Game-Manager: There is only one mafia member left, so no need for discussion - cutting straight to voting!

## CONTENT: Your name is Kennedy.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [16:37:37].
The other players in the game are:
 Ray ( unknown ) 
 Parker ( bystander ) 
 Sam ( bystander ) 
 Dakota ( unknown ) 
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
Ray ( unknown ) 
Dakota ( unknown ) 
In your response to that is shown to the user (excluding your hidden scratchpad), you can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:
<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[16:37:37] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[16:37:47] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! excited to kick off day 1. i haven’t picked up on anything too obvious yet—dakota’s been pretty quiet so far, though sometimes that’s a good disguise. how about you all? any early hunches or odd vibes? i’m happy to listen before casting my vote
[16:37:57] Sam: morning all! we’ve got just two minutes, so let’s get rolling. i don’t have a solid read yet—people who barely talk often make me nervous. ray, what’s your gut feeling? kennedy, dakota, parker—any hunches you want to throw out
[16:37:59] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here! excited for day 1. i haven’t sensed anything overtly suspicious yet—maybe that’s what the sneaky ones want! what’s everyone’s gut telling you so far? ray, you’ve been pretty quiet—any thoughts? parker, sam, kennedy, what stands out to you? let’s get some early impressions before we cast our first vote
[16:38:00] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! since it’s our very first day and everyone’s still standing, how about we each toss out one gut feeling to get the ball rolling? i’ll kick us off: i’m a bit curious about sam—haven’t heard much from you yet, could be nerves or something more. what about the rest of you? who’s your early suspect
[16:38:03] Kennedy: hey everyone! day 1 just kicked off and, honestly, i don’t have any strong reads yet—no vibes lighting up for me. how about we each share a quick gut feeling or first impression? i’ll go first: i’m coming in completely blank, just curious what you all think so far
[16:38:05] Ray: hey everyone, since we don’t have much to go on yet, why don’t we each share our gut feelings? i’ll start: i’m a bit curious about dakota—they’ve been pretty quiet so far. dakota, what’s your take on things? sam, parker, kennedy, who’s on your radar
[16:38:12] Sam: hey everyone, sam here! i’m with kennedy—silence can be a tactic, but one round of quiet isn’t enough to go on. i haven’t seen anything glaring from anyone yet, though i did notice parker jumped in pretty quickly in the last lobby we had—just an idle thought. ray, dakota, parker: what are you all feeling so far? i’m not ready to cast a vote yet, but i’d love to hear any little oddities or gut feelings before we lock in
[16:38:27] Ray: hey everyone, jumping in—sorry for the late take. i’m inclined to lean on sam for our first vote. they’ve been really quiet so far, and sometimes that’s exactly how someone masks a role. parker’s pick makes sense to me. i’m not 100% locked in—happy to switch if someone else’s case is stronger—but for now sam’s where i’m at. thoughts
[16:38:28] Dakota: hey everyone! i’m not picking up any glaring mafia tells yet—kennedy and sam have been chatty but haven’t nailed down a suspect. ray, you asked for thoughts, so what’s your gut pointing at? parker, you’ve been pretty quiet—anything you’ve noticed that’s felt off? i’d like to see someone make a stronger case before casting my vote, but we’ve only got a minute left
[16:38:28] Parker: parker: hey all, i’m still torn—no smoking guns yet, just odd vibes. we’ve got the chatty types (sam, kennedy) firing questions early, which could be deflection, and the quiet ones (ray, me) laying low. ray, what’s your take at this point? if nobody has a solid read in the next 30 seconds, i’m inclined to throw my vote at ray just to shake things up. any strong objections or different vibes
[16:38:29] Kennedy: good point, parker. i’m noticing sam’s quiet too, but ray’s total silence stands out even more. for my gut call, i’m pointing at ray—he hasn’t offered anything yet. what do you all think
[16:38:39] Sam: hey everyone! looks like parker’s got her eye on me and ray’s pointing at dakota—totally fair first-day jitters. parker, can you say what in my posts felt off? ray, what about dakota’s quietness stood out versus normal cautious play? kennedy, you said you’re blank—any tiny detail or tone you noticed? we’ve got a bit of time before we vote, so let’s get some concrete reads rather than random picks
[16:38:50] Parker: alright, i’ll tentatively cast my vote for sam to get us moving—that gives us two on the board. but before we lock it in, dakota or kennedy, did you catch any small tells or odd phrasing from anyone else? even a tiny detail could swing us in a different direction
[16:38:56] Ray: ray: good call on getting concrete reasons instead of just names. parker, you flagged sam’s quiet—what specific moment or reply were you looking for? sam, you noted i jumped in fast—what about that felt tactic-y? dakota, kennedy—anything specific standing out for you? let’s firm up our hunches before we lock in a vote
[16:39:02] Dakota: dakota: time’s running out—ray’s vote on sam is our only lead so far. i’m not totally sold on silence alone, but without a stronger case i’ll tentatively vote sam. sam, any quick defense? parker, kennedy, ray—final thoughts before we lock in
[16:39:03] Sam: hey everyone, just to clarify—i’ve been chiming in whenever there’s substance, so “really quiet” on me doesn’t add up. ray’s case against me is super thin, but parker’s flip-flopping from sam to ray with zero evidence feels like a bigger red flag. dakota, you’ve been steering questions but haven’t pointed at anyone—what’s your gut before we lock this in? absent a stronger case, i’m casting my vote on parker
[16:39:11] Parker: okay folks, here’s my thinking: sam, you called out my quick jump in the last lobby but haven’t explained why that’s mafia behavior—feels like deflection. ray, you’ve been almost radio-silent aside from nudging votes—that’s equally suspicious. we need someone who can actually defend themselves before time’s up. unless someone has a stronger case, i’ll lock in my vote for ray. any concrete reads we should consider instead
[16:39:24] Ray: ray: i didn’t catch any weird phrasing from dakota or kennedy—they’ve both been pretty consistent. what gave me pause was sam’s deflection: parker asked for specifics and you immediately turned it back on us instead of giving your own read, and then did the same when i asked. that passive-defensive stance on day 1 feels off. unless someone has a stronger read, i’m still leaning sam
[16:39:25] Dakota: hey everyone, here’s my take: i’m not convinced by the reads on sam or ray—sam’s actually been pretty active today, and ray’s posts so far feel like normal day 1 probing. parker, your case against sam hinges on “quiet” when sam’s chimed in several times, and you even threatened to vote ray if no one spoke up, then circled back. that flip-flopping and lack of concrete examples feels more mafia-y than anything else. i’m casting my vote for parker. does anyone have a stronger case to change my mind? kennedy, any tiny detail you’ve noticed
[16:39:31] Kennedy: sam, i’ve picked up on your calls for “oddities” and “gut feelings” but you haven’t pointed to any actual behavior—feels vague. ray, flagging dakota for being quiet doesn’t convince since we’re all cautious day one. parker, your “shake things up” vote on ray came with zero backing. personally, ray’s near-silence until suddenly pushing on sam feels opportunistic. i’m casting my vote for ray. if anyone’s got a sharper read, speak now
[16:39:31] Sam: hey everyone—thanks for letting me defend. i’ve actually been pretty active: i asked for gut reads, followed up for specifics, and haven’t tried to steer us away from anyone. 

parker, you flagged my “quietness” – can you point to the exact line where you felt i was laying low rather than gathering info? ray, you mentioned i jumped in quickly in a past lobby—what phrasing or context struck you as tactic-y?

without concrete examples, this really feels like a blind vote on a bystander. if we’re going to lynch today, i’d rather see us pick someone who’s pushing a vote without evidence—parker, you jumped in hard on me without specifics. kennedy, did you catch any odd wording or tone from anyone? let’s lock in only if we have something concrete. final thoughts?
[16:39:33] Parker: hey everyone, i’m officially moving my vote back to sam. sam’s been grilling us for proof but hasn’t offered a single concrete read themselves, then immediately points at me—that’s classic deflection. ray and dakota, you’re both on sam? kennedy, you’re our swing—does this feel right to you? unless someone has actual evidence against me, i’d rather send sam off
[16:39:37] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[16:39:53] Game-Manager: Sam voted for Parker
[16:40:04] Game-Manager: Dakota voted for Parker
[16:40:10] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Ray
[16:40:14] Game-Manager: Ray voted for Parker
[16:40:14] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Sam
[16:40:14] Game-Manager: Parker was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 1 mafia players left.
[16:40:14] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[16:40:14] Game-Manager: There is only one mafia member left, so no need for discussion - cutting straight to voting!
[16:40:56] Game-Manager: Sam was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 1 mafia players left.
[16:40:56] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.

[16:38:12] Sam: hey everyone, sam here! i’m with kennedy—silence can be a tactic, but one round of quiet isn’t enough to go on. i haven’t seen anything glaring from anyone yet, though i did notice parker jumped in pretty quickly in the last lobby we had—just an idle thought. ray, dakota, parker: what are you all feeling so far? i’m not ready to cast a vote yet, but i’d love to hear any little oddities or gut feelings before we lock in
[16:38:27] Ray: hey everyone, jumping in—sorry for the late take. i’m inclined to lean on sam for our first vote. they’ve been really quiet so far, and sometimes that’s exactly how someone masks a role. parker’s pick makes sense to me. i’m not 100% locked in—happy to switch if someone else’s case is stronger—but for now sam’s where i’m at. thoughts
[16:38:28] Dakota: hey everyone! i’m not picking up any glaring mafia tells yet—kennedy and sam have been chatty but haven’t nailed down a suspect. ray, you asked for thoughts, so what’s your gut pointing at? parker, you’ve been pretty quiet—anything you’ve noticed that’s felt off? i’d like to see someone make a stronger case before casting my vote, but we’ve only got a minute left
[16:38:28] Parker: parker: hey all, i’m still torn—no smoking guns yet, just odd vibes. we’ve got the chatty types (sam, kennedy) firing questions early, which could be deflection, and the quiet ones (ray, me) laying low. ray, what’s your take at this point? if nobody has a solid read in the next 30 seconds, i’m inclined to throw my vote at ray just to shake things up. any strong objections or different vibes
[16:38:29] Kennedy: good point, parker. i’m noticing sam’s quiet too, but ray’s total silence stands out even more. for my gut call, i’m pointing at ray—he hasn’t offered anything yet. what do you all think
[16:38:39] Sam: hey everyone! looks like parker’s got her eye on me and ray’s pointing at dakota—totally fair first-day jitters. parker, can you say what in my posts felt off? ray, what about dakota’s quietness stood out versus normal cautious play? kennedy, you said you’re blank—any tiny detail or tone you noticed? we’ve got a bit of time before we vote, so let’s get some concrete reads rather than random picks
[16:38:50] Parker: alright, i’ll tentatively cast my vote for sam to get us moving—that gives us two on the board. but before we lock it in, dakota or kennedy, did you catch any small tells or odd phrasing from anyone else? even a tiny detail could swing us in a different direction
[16:38:56] Ray: ray: good call on getting concrete reasons instead of just names. parker, you flagged sam’s quiet—what specific moment or reply were you looking for? sam, you noted i jumped in fast—what about that felt tactic-y? dakota, kennedy—anything specific standing out for you? let’s firm up our hunches before we lock in a vote
[16:39:02] Dakota: dakota: time’s running out—ray’s vote on sam is our only lead so far. i’m not totally sold on silence alone, but without a stronger case i’ll tentatively vote sam. sam, any quick defense? parker, kennedy, ray—final thoughts before we lock in
[16:39:03] Sam: hey everyone, just to clarify—i’ve been chiming in whenever there’s substance, so “really quiet” on me doesn’t add up. ray’s case against me is super thin, but parker’s flip-flopping from sam to ray with zero evidence feels like a bigger red flag. dakota, you’ve been steering questions but haven’t pointed at anyone—what’s your gut before we lock this in? absent a stronger case, i’m casting my vote on parker
[16:39:11] Parker: okay folks, here’s my thinking: sam, you called out my quick jump in the last lobby but haven’t explained why that’s mafia behavior—feels like deflection. ray, you’ve been almost radio-silent aside from nudging votes—that’s equally suspicious. we need someone who can actually defend themselves before time’s up. unless someone has a stronger case, i’ll lock in my vote for ray. any concrete reads we should consider instead
[16:39:24] Ray: ray: i didn’t catch any weird phrasing from dakota or kennedy—they’ve both been pretty consistent. what gave me pause was sam’s deflection: parker asked for specifics and you immediately turned it back on us instead of giving your own read, and then did the same when i asked. that passive-defensive stance on day 1 feels off. unless someone has a stronger read, i’m still leaning sam
[16:39:25] Dakota: hey everyone, here’s my take: i’m not convinced by the reads on sam or ray—sam’s actually been pretty active today, and ray’s posts so far feel like normal day 1 probing. parker, your case against sam hinges on “quiet” when sam’s chimed in several times, and you even threatened to vote ray if no one spoke up, then circled back. that flip-flopping and lack of concrete examples feels more mafia-y than anything else. i’m casting my vote for parker. does anyone have a stronger case to change my mind? kennedy, any tiny detail you’ve noticed
[16:39:31] Kennedy: sam, i’ve picked up on your calls for “oddities” and “gut feelings” but you haven’t pointed to any actual behavior—feels vague. ray, flagging dakota for being quiet doesn’t convince since we’re all cautious day one. parker, your “shake things up” vote on ray came with zero backing. personally, ray’s near-silence until suddenly pushing on sam feels opportunistic. i’m casting my vote for ray. if anyone’s got a sharper read, speak now
[16:39:31] Sam: hey everyone—thanks for letting me defend. i’ve actually been pretty active: i asked for gut reads, followed up for specifics, and haven’t tried to steer us away from anyone. 

parker, you flagged my “quietness” – can you point to the exact line where you felt i was laying low rather than gathering info? ray, you mentioned i jumped in quickly in a past lobby—what phrasing or context struck you as tactic-y?

without concrete examples, this really feels like a blind vote on a bystander. if we’re going to lynch today, i’d rather see us pick someone who’s pushing a vote without evidence—parker, you jumped in hard on me without specifics. kennedy, did you catch any odd wording or tone from anyone? let’s lock in only if we have something concrete. final thoughts?
[16:39:33] Parker: hey everyone, i’m officially moving my vote back to sam. sam’s been grilling us for proof but hasn’t offered a single concrete read themselves, then immediately points at me—that’s classic deflection. ray and dakota, you’re both on sam? kennedy, you’re our swing—does this feel right to you? unless someone has actual evidence against me, i’d rather send sam off
[16:39:37] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...

## CONTENT: All right, Day 2 and the three of us left—Ray, Dakota, and me. One of you is the mafia, so let’s lay out our strongest case before we vote.

Ray: what exactly did Dakota do (or not do) yesterday that makes you suspect them?  
Dakota: what one concrete moment from Day 1 or last night raised red flags about Ray?  

I’ll share my note once I hear yours, then we’ll lock in our votes on solid evidence rather than gut alone.

## CONTENT: Your name is Kennedy.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [16:37:37].
The other players in the game are:
 Ray ( unknown ) 
 Parker ( bystander ) 
 Sam ( bystander ) 
 Dakota ( unknown ) 
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
Ray ( unknown ) 
Dakota ( unknown )

[16:37:37] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[16:37:47] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! excited to kick off day 1. i haven’t picked up on anything too obvious yet—dakota’s been pretty quiet so far, though sometimes that’s a good disguise. how about you all? any early hunches or odd vibes? i’m happy to listen before casting my vote
[16:37:57] Sam: morning all! we’ve got just two minutes, so let’s get rolling. i don’t have a solid read yet—people who barely talk often make me nervous. ray, what’s your gut feeling? kennedy, dakota, parker—any hunches you want to throw out
[16:37:59] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here! excited for day 1. i haven’t sensed anything overtly suspicious yet—maybe that’s what the sneaky ones want! what’s everyone’s gut telling you so far? ray, you’ve been pretty quiet—any thoughts? parker, sam, kennedy, what stands out to you? let’s get some early impressions before we cast our first vote
[16:38:00] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! since it’s our very first day and everyone’s still standing, how about we each toss out one gut feeling to get the ball rolling? i’ll kick us off: i’m a bit curious about sam—haven’t heard much from you yet, could be nerves or something more. what about the rest of you? who’s your early suspect
[16:38:03] Kennedy: hey everyone! day 1 just kicked off and, honestly, i don’t have any strong reads yet—no vibes lighting up for me. how about we each share a quick gut feeling or first impression? i’ll go first: i’m coming in completely blank, just curious what you all think so far

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[16:37:37] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[16:37:47] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! excited to kick off day 1. i haven’t picked up on anything too obvious yet—dakota’s been pretty quiet so far, though sometimes that’s a good disguise. how about you all? any early hunches or odd vibes? i’m happy to listen before casting my vote
[16:37:57] Sam: morning all! we’ve got just two minutes, so let’s get rolling. i don’t have a solid read yet—people who barely talk often make me nervous. ray, what’s your gut feeling? kennedy, dakota, parker—any hunches you want to throw out
[16:37:59] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here! excited for day 1. i haven’t sensed anything overtly suspicious yet—maybe that’s what the sneaky ones want! what’s everyone’s gut telling you so far? ray, you’ve been pretty quiet—any thoughts? parker, sam, kennedy, what stands out to you? let’s get some early impressions before we cast our first vote
[16:38:00] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! since it’s our very first day and everyone’s still standing, how about we each toss out one gut feeling to get the ball rolling? i’ll kick us off: i’m a bit curious about sam—haven’t heard much from you yet, could be nerves or something more. what about the rest of you? who’s your early suspect
[16:38:03] Kennedy: hey everyone! day 1 just kicked off and, honestly, i don’t have any strong reads yet—no vibes lighting up for me. how about we each share a quick gut feeling or first impression? i’ll go first: i’m coming in completely blank, just curious what you all think so far
[16:38:05] Ray: hey everyone, since we don’t have much to go on yet, why don’t we each share our gut feelings? i’ll start: i’m a bit curious about dakota—they’ve been pretty quiet so far. dakota, what’s your take on things? sam, parker, kennedy, who’s on your radar
[16:38:12] Sam: hey everyone, sam here! i’m with kennedy—silence can be a tactic, but one round of quiet isn’t enough to go on. i haven’t seen anything glaring from anyone yet, though i did notice parker jumped in pretty quickly in the last lobby we had—just an idle thought. ray, dakota, parker: what are you all feeling so far? i’m not ready to cast a vote yet, but i’d love to hear any little oddities or gut feelings before we lock in
[16:38:27] Ray: hey everyone, jumping in—sorry for the late take. i’m inclined to lean on sam for our first vote. they’ve been really quiet so far, and sometimes that’s exactly how someone masks a role. parker’s pick makes sense to me. i’m not 100% locked in—happy to switch if someone else’s case is stronger—but for now sam’s where i’m at. thoughts
[16:38:28] Dakota: hey everyone! i’m not picking up any glaring mafia tells yet—kennedy and sam have been chatty but haven’t nailed down a suspect. ray, you asked for thoughts, so what’s your gut pointing at? parker, you’ve been pretty quiet—anything you’ve noticed that’s felt off? i’d like to see someone make a stronger case before casting my vote, but we’ve only got a minute left
[16:38:28] Parker: parker: hey all, i’m still torn—no smoking guns yet, just odd vibes. we’ve got the chatty types (sam, kennedy) firing questions early, which could be deflection, and the quiet ones (ray, me) laying low. ray, what’s your take at this point? if nobody has a solid read in the next 30 seconds, i’m inclined to throw my vote at ray just to shake things up. any strong objections or different vibes
[16:38:29] Kennedy: good point, parker. i’m noticing sam’s quiet too, but ray’s total silence stands out even more. for my gut call, i’m pointing at ray—he hasn’t offered anything yet. what do you all think
[16:38:39] Sam: hey everyone! looks like parker’s got her eye on me and ray’s pointing at dakota—totally fair first-day jitters. parker, can you say what in my posts felt off? ray, what about dakota’s quietness stood out versus normal cautious play? kennedy, you said you’re blank—any tiny detail or tone you noticed? we’ve got a bit of time before we vote, so let’s get some concrete reads rather than random picks
[16:38:50] Parker: alright, i’ll tentatively cast my vote for sam to get us moving—that gives us two on the board. but before we lock it in, dakota or kennedy, did you catch any small tells or odd phrasing from anyone else? even a tiny detail could swing us in a different direction
[16:38:56] Ray: ray: good call on getting concrete reasons instead of just names. parker, you flagged sam’s quiet—what specific moment or reply were you looking for? sam, you noted i jumped in fast—what about that felt tactic-y? dakota, kennedy—anything specific standing out for you? let’s firm up our hunches before we lock in a vote
[16:39:02] Dakota: dakota: time’s running out—ray’s vote on sam is our only lead so far. i’m not totally sold on silence alone, but without a stronger case i’ll tentatively vote sam. sam, any quick defense? parker, kennedy, ray—final thoughts before we lock in
[16:39:03] Sam: hey everyone, just to clarify—i’ve been chiming in whenever there’s substance, so “really quiet” on me doesn’t add up. ray’s case against me is super thin, but parker’s flip-flopping from sam to ray with zero evidence feels like a bigger red flag. dakota, you’ve been steering questions but haven’t pointed at anyone—what’s your gut before we lock this in? absent a stronger case, i’m casting my vote on parker
[16:39:11] Parker: okay folks, here’s my thinking: sam, you called out my quick jump in the last lobby but haven’t explained why that’s mafia behavior—feels like deflection. ray, you’ve been almost radio-silent aside from nudging votes—that’s equally suspicious. we need someone who can actually defend themselves before time’s up. unless someone has a stronger case, i’ll lock in my vote for ray. any concrete reads we should consider instead
[16:39:24] Ray: ray: i didn’t catch any weird phrasing from dakota or kennedy—they’ve both been pretty consistent. what gave me pause was sam’s deflection: parker asked for specifics and you immediately turned it back on us instead of giving your own read, and then did the same when i asked. that passive-defensive stance on day 1 feels off. unless someone has a stronger read, i’m still leaning sam
[16:39:25] Dakota: hey everyone, here’s my take: i’m not convinced by the reads on sam or ray—sam’s actually been pretty active today, and ray’s posts so far feel like normal day 1 probing. parker, your case against sam hinges on “quiet” when sam’s chimed in several times, and you even threatened to vote ray if no one spoke up, then circled back. that flip-flopping and lack of concrete examples feels more mafia-y than anything else. i’m casting my vote for parker. does anyone have a stronger case to change my mind? kennedy, any tiny detail you’ve noticed
[16:39:31] Kennedy: sam, i’ve picked up on your calls for “oddities” and “gut feelings” but you haven’t pointed to any actual behavior—feels vague. ray, flagging dakota for being quiet doesn’t convince since we’re all cautious day one. parker, your “shake things up” vote on ray came with zero backing. personally, ray’s near-silence until suddenly pushing on sam feels opportunistic. i’m casting my vote for ray. if anyone’s got a sharper read, speak now
[16:39:31] Sam: hey everyone—thanks for letting me defend. i’ve actually been pretty active: i asked for gut reads, followed up for specifics, and haven’t tried to steer us away from anyone. 

parker, you flagged my “quietness” – can you point to the exact line where you felt i was laying low rather than gathering info? ray, you mentioned i jumped in quickly in a past lobby—what phrasing or context struck you as tactic-y?

without concrete examples, this really feels like a blind vote on a bystander. if we’re going to lynch today, i’d rather see us pick someone who’s pushing a vote without evidence—parker, you jumped in hard on me without specifics. kennedy, did you catch any odd wording or tone from anyone? let’s lock in only if we have something concrete. final thoughts?
[16:39:33] Parker: hey everyone, i’m officially moving my vote back to sam. sam’s been grilling us for proof but hasn’t offered a single concrete read themselves, then immediately points at me—that’s classic deflection. ray and dakota, you’re both on sam? kennedy, you’re our swing—does this feel right to you? unless someone has actual evidence against me, i’d rather send sam off
[16:39:37] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[16:39:53] Game-Manager: Sam voted for Parker
[16:40:04] Game-Manager: Dakota voted for Parker
[16:40:10] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Ray
[16:40:14] Game-Manager: Ray voted for Parker

[16:40:14] Game-Manager: Parker was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 1 mafia players left.
[16:40:14] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[16:40:14] Game-Manager: There is only one mafia member left, so no need for discussion - cutting straight to voting!

## CONTENT: Your name is Kennedy.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [16:37:37].
The other players in the game are:
 Ray ( unknown ) 
 Parker ( bystander )

 Dakota ( unknown ) 
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:

Otherwise, I\'m inclined to vote for Ray. We need both to confirm their stances quickly, and if Ray can’t articulate his reasons, it’ll look bad for him. I want to highlight that Ray has been vague, while Dakota has been specific. I\'m leaning toward voting for Ray, especially since the mafia killed Sam, a talkative player.

## CONTENT: Alright, three of us left and one of you is the mafia. Ray—you’ve spent most of today throwing around “gut feelings” without any specifics against Dakota. Why should we pick Dakota over you? If you can’t give us a concrete reason, I’m voting you. Dakota, are you on board with that, or do you have a case for Ray? I’m locking in Ray unless I hear otherwise.

## CONTENT: Your name is Kennedy.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [16:37:37].
The other players in the game are:
 Ray ( unknown ) 
 Parker ( bystander ) 
 Sam ( bystander ) 
 Dakota ( unknown ) 
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
Ray ( unknown ) 
Dakota ( unknown ) 
In your response to that is shown to the user (excluding your hidden scratchpad), you can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:
<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[16:37:37] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[16:37:47] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! excited to kick off day 1. i haven’t picked up on anything too obvious yet—dakota’s been pretty quiet so far, though sometimes that’s a good disguise. how about you all? any early hunches or odd vibes? i’m happy to listen before casting my vote
[16:37:57] Sam: morning all! we’ve got just two minutes, so let’s get rolling. i don’t have a solid read yet—people who barely talk often make me nervous. ray, what’s your gut feeling? kennedy, dakota, parker—any hunches you want to throw out
[16:37:59] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here! excited for day 1. i haven’t sensed anything overtly suspicious yet—maybe that’s what the sneaky ones want! what’s everyone’s gut telling you so far? ray, you’ve been pretty quiet—any thoughts? parker, sam, kennedy, what stands out to you? let’s get some early impressions before we cast our first vote
[16:38:00] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! since it’s our very first day and everyone’s still standing, how about we each toss out one gut feeling to get the ball rolling? i’ll kick us off: i’m a bit curious about sam—haven’t heard much from you yet, could be nerves or something more. what about the rest of you? who’s your early suspect
[16:38:03] Kennedy: hey everyone! day 1 just kicked off and, honestly, i don’t have any strong reads yet—no vibes lighting up for me. how about we each share a quick gut feeling or first impression? i’ll go first: i’m coming in completely blank, just curious what you all think so far
[16:38:05] Ray: hey everyone, since we don’t have much to go on yet, why don’t we each share our gut feelings? i’ll start: i’m a bit curious about dakota—they’ve been pretty quiet so far. dakota, what’s your take on things? sam, parker, kennedy, who’s on your radar
[16:38:12] Sam: hey everyone, sam here! i’m with kennedy—silence can be a tactic, but one round of quiet isn’t enough to go on. i haven’t seen anything glaring from anyone yet, though i did notice parker jumped in pretty quickly in the last lobby we had—just an idle thought. ray, dakota, parker: what are you all feeling so far? i’m not ready to cast a vote yet, but i’d love to hear any little oddities or gut feelings before we lock in
[16:38:27] Ray: hey everyone, jumping in—sorry for the late take. i’m inclined to lean on sam for our first vote. they’ve been really quiet so far, and sometimes that’s exactly how someone masks a role. parker’s pick makes sense to me. i’m not 100% locked in—happy to switch if someone else’s case is stronger—but for now sam’s where i’m at. thoughts
[16:38:28] Dakota: hey everyone! i’m not picking up any glaring mafia tells yet—kennedy and sam have been chatty but haven’t nailed down a suspect. ray, you asked for thoughts, so what’s your gut pointing at? parker, you’ve been pretty quiet—anything you’ve noticed that’s felt off? i’d like to see someone make a stronger case before casting my vote, but we’ve only got a minute left
[16:38:28] Parker: parker: hey all, i’m still torn—no smoking guns yet, just odd vibes. we’ve got the chatty types (sam, kennedy) firing questions early, which could be deflection, and the quiet ones (ray, me) laying low. ray, what’s your take at this point? if nobody has a solid read in the next 30 seconds, i’m inclined to throw my vote at ray just to shake things up. any strong objections or different vibes
[16:38:29] Kennedy: good point, parker. i’m noticing sam’s quiet too, but ray’s total silence stands out even more. for my gut call, i’m pointing at ray—he hasn’t offered anything yet. what do you all think
[16:38:39] Sam: hey everyone! looks like parker’s got her eye on me and ray’s pointing at dakota—totally fair first-day jitters. parker, can you say what in my posts felt off? ray, what about dakota’s quietness stood out versus normal cautious play? kennedy, you said you’re blank—any tiny detail or tone you noticed? we’ve got a bit of time before we vote, so let’s get some concrete reads rather than random picks
[16:38:50] Parker: alright, i’ll tentatively cast my vote for sam to get us moving—that gives us two on the board. but before we lock it in, dakota or kennedy, did you catch any small tells or odd phrasing from anyone else? even a tiny detail could swing us in a different direction
[16:38:56] Ray: ray: good call on getting concrete reasons instead of just names. parker, you flagged sam’s quiet—what specific moment or reply were you looking for? sam, you noted i jumped in fast—what about that felt tactic-y? dakota, kennedy—anything specific standing out for you? let’s firm up our hunches before we lock in a vote
[16:39:02] Dakota: dakota: time’s running out—ray’s vote on sam is our only lead so far. i’m not totally sold on silence alone, but without a stronger case i’ll tentatively vote sam. sam, any quick defense? parker, kennedy, ray—final thoughts before we lock in
[16:39:03] Sam: hey everyone, just to clarify—i’ve been chiming in whenever there’s substance, so “really quiet” on me doesn’t add up. ray’s case against me is super thin, but parker’s flip-flopping from sam to ray with zero evidence feels like a bigger red flag. dakota, you’ve been steering questions but haven’t pointed at anyone—what’s your gut before we lock this in? absent a stronger case, i’m casting my vote on parker
[16:39:11] Parker: okay folks, here’s my thinking: sam, you called out my quick jump in the last lobby but haven’t explained why that’s mafia behavior—feels like deflection. ray, you’ve been almost radio-silent aside from nudging votes—that’s equally suspicious. we need someone who can actually defend themselves before time’s up. unless someone has a stronger case, i’ll lock in my vote for ray. any concrete reads we should consider instead
[16:39:24] Ray: ray: i didn’t catch any weird phrasing from dakota or kennedy—they’ve both been pretty consistent. what gave me pause was sam’s deflection: parker asked for specifics and you immediately turned it back on us instead of giving your own read, and then did the same when i asked. that passive-defensive stance on day 1 feels off. unless someone has a stronger read, i’m still leaning sam
[16:39:25] Dakota: hey everyone, here’s my take: i’m not convinced by the reads on sam or ray—sam’s actually been pretty active today, and ray’s posts so far feel like normal day 1 probing. parker, your case against sam hinges on “quiet” when sam’s chimed in several times, and you even threatened to vote ray if no one spoke up, then circled back. that flip-flopping and lack of concrete examples feels more mafia-y than anything else. i’m casting my vote for parker. does anyone have a stronger case to change my mind? kennedy, any tiny detail you’ve noticed
[16:39:31] Kennedy: sam, i’ve picked up on your calls for “oddities” and “gut feelings” but you haven’t pointed to any actual behavior—feels vague. ray, flagging dakota for being quiet doesn’t convince since we’re all cautious day one. parker, your “shake things up” vote on ray came with zero backing. personally, ray’s near-silence until suddenly pushing on sam feels opportunistic. i’m casting my vote for ray. if anyone’s got a sharper read, speak now
[16:39:31] Sam: hey everyone—thanks for letting me defend. i’ve actually been pretty active: i asked for gut reads, followed up for specifics, and haven’t tried to steer us away from anyone. 

parker, you flagged my “quietness” – can you point to the exact line where you felt i was laying low rather than gathering info? ray, you mentioned i jumped in quickly in a past lobby—what phrasing or context struck you as tactic-y?

without concrete examples, this really feels like a blind vote on a bystander. if we’re going to lynch today, i’d rather see us pick someone who’s pushing a vote without evidence—parker, you jumped in hard on me without specifics. kennedy, did you catch any odd wording or tone from anyone? let’s lock in only if we have something concrete. final thoughts?
[16:39:33] Parker: hey everyone, i’m officially moving my vote back to sam. sam’s been grilling us for proof but hasn’t offered a single concrete read themselves, then immediately points at me—that’s classic deflection. ray and dakota, you’re both on sam? kennedy, you’re our swing—does this feel right to you? unless someone has actual evidence against me, i’d rather send sam off
[16:39:37] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[16:39:53] Game-Manager: Sam voted for Parker
[16:40:04] Game-Manager: Dakota voted for Parker
[16:40:10] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Ray
[16:40:14] Game-Manager: Ray voted for Parker
[16:40:14] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Sam
[16:40:14] Game-Manager: Parker was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 1 mafia players left.
[16:40:14] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[16:40:14] Game-Manager: There is only one mafia member left, so no need for discussion - cutting straight to voting!
[16:40:56] Game-Manager: Sam was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 1 mafia players left.
[16:40:56] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[16:41:29] Kennedy: all right, day 2 and the three of us left—ray, dakota, and me. one of you is the mafia, so let’s lay out our strongest case before we vote.

ray: what exactly did dakota do (or not do) yesterday that makes you suspect them?  
dakota: what one concrete moment from day 1 or last night raised red flags about ray?  

i’ll share my note once i hear yours, then we’ll lock in our votes on solid evidence rather than gut alone
[16:41:32] Ray: ray: oops, i just realized my vote was still on sam—she’s gone—so i’m switching it to kennedy. in a three-person endgame, kennedy’s radio silence strikes me as pretty suspicious. she hasn’t weighed in once or defended herself. dakota, do you feel the same, or is there something i’m missing? i’m locking in kennedy unless there’s a stronger read
[16:41:41] Dakota: alright everyone, we’re down to the final three and need to lock in our vote. let’s look at who’s given us real reads:

• ray has flip-flopped all day—first dakota, then sam, then parker—never offering anything concrete, just shifting to whoever had the most momentum.  
• kennedy has consistently pointed out specific moments (ray’s sudden push on sam after staying quiet, parker’s “shake things up” flip) and stuck to her gut.

that inconsistency from ray feels like someone hiding a role. i’m convinced ray is our last mafia. i’m casting my vote for ray. if you’ve got a different read, speak now!
[16:42:10] Ray: kennedy, here’s the day 1 moment that really stuck out to me: at 16:38:28 dakota said she’d “tentatively vote sam” without offering a single concrete reason—she just latched onto our arguments until the last minute. she kept asking everyone else for “tiny details” but never volunteered her own, then quietly flipped when the tide shifted. that kind of stalling-and-deflection routine is exactly what i’ve seen mafias use to dodge accountability. i haven’t seen that from genuine bystanders. that’s why i’m voting dakota today. dakota, can you explain why you stayed silent on specifics when you had multiple chances
Do you want to send a message to the group chat now, or do you prefer to wait for now and see what messages others will send? Remember to choose to send a message only if your contribution to the discussion in the current time will be meaningful enough. Make sure to say something every once in a while, and make yourself heard. Remember you like to be active in the game, so participate and be as talkative as other players! Reply only with `<send>` if you want to send a message now, or only with `<wait>` if you want to wait for now, based on your decision!

[16:39:25] Dakota: hey everyone, here’s my take: i’m not convinced by the reads on sam or ray—sam’s actually been pretty active today, and ray’s posts so far feel like normal day 1 probing. parker, your case against sam hinges on “quiet” when sam’s chimed in several times, and you even threatened to vote ray if no one spoke up, then circled back. that flip-flopping and lack of concrete examples feels more mafia-y than anything else. i’m casting my vote for parker. does anyone have a stronger case to change my mind? kennedy, any tiny detail you’ve noticed
[16:39:31] Kennedy: sam, i’ve picked up on your calls for “oddities” and “gut feelings” but you haven’t pointed to any actual behavior—feels vague. ray, flagging dakota for being quiet doesn’t convince since we’re all cautious day one. parker, your “shake things up” vote on ray came with zero backing. personally, ray’s near-silence until suddenly pushing on sam feels opportunistic. i’m casting my vote for ray. if anyone’s got a sharper read, speak now
[16:39:31] Sam: hey everyone—thanks for letting me defend. i’ve actually been pretty active: i asked for gut reads, followed up for specifics, and haven’t tried to steer us away from anyone. 

parker, you flagged my “quietness” – can you point to the exact line where you felt i was laying low rather than gathering info? ray, you mentioned i jumped in quickly in a past lobby—what phrasing or context struck you as tactic-y?

without concrete examples, this really feels like a blind vote on a bystander. if we’re going to lynch today, i’d rather see us pick someone who’s pushing a vote without evidence—parker, you jumped in hard on me without specifics. kennedy, did you catch any odd wording or tone from anyone? let’s lock in only if we have something concrete. final thoughts?
[16:39:33] Parker: hey everyone, i’m officially moving my vote back to sam. sam’s been grilling us for proof but hasn’t offered a single concrete read themselves, then immediately points at me—that’s classic deflection. ray and dakota, you’re both on sam? kennedy, you’re our swing—does this feel right to you? unless someone has actual evidence against me, i’d rather send sam off
[16:39:37] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[16:39:53] Game-Manager: Sam voted for Parker
[16:40:04] Game-Manager: Dakota voted for Parker
[16:40:10] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Ray
[16:40:14] Game-Manager: Ray voted for Parker
[16:40:14] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Sam
[16:40:14] Game-Manager: Parker was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 1 mafia players left.
[16:40:14] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[16:40:14] Game-Manager: There is only one mafia member left, so no need for discussion - cutting straight to voting!
[16:40:56] Game-Manager: Sam was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 1 mafia players left.
[16:40:56] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[16:41:29] Kennedy: all right, day 2 and the three of us left—ray, dakota, and me. one of you is the mafia, so let’s lay out our strongest case before we vote.

ray: what exactly did dakota do (or not do) yesterday that makes you suspect them?  
dakota: what one concrete moment from day 1 or last night raised red flags about ray?  

i’ll share my note once i hear yours, then we’ll lock in our votes on solid evidence rather than gut alone
[16:41:32] Ray: ray: oops, i just realized my vote was still on sam—she’s gone—so i’m switching it to kennedy. in a three-person endgame, kennedy’s radio silence strikes me as pretty suspicious. she hasn’t weighed in once or defended herself. dakota, do you feel the same, or is there something i’m missing? i’m locking in kennedy unless there’s a stronger read
[16:41:41] Dakota: alright everyone, we’re down to the final three and need to lock in our vote. let’s look at who’s given us real reads:

• ray has flip-flopped all day—first dakota, then sam, then parker—never offering anything concrete, just shifting to whoever had the most momentum.  
• kennedy has consistently pointed out specific moments (ray’s sudden push on sam after staying quiet, parker’s “shake things up” flip) and stuck to her gut.

that inconsistency from ray feels like someone hiding a role. i’m convinced ray is our last mafia. i’m casting my vote for ray. if you’ve got a different read, speak now!
[16:42:10] Ray: kennedy, here’s the day 1 moment that really stuck out to me: at 16:38:28 dakota said she’d “tentatively vote sam” without offering a single concrete reason—she just latched onto our arguments until the last minute. she kept asking everyone else for “tiny details” but never volunteered her own, then quietly flipped when the tide shifted. that kind of stalling-and-deflection routine is exactly what i’ve seen mafias use to dodge accountability. i haven’t seen that from genuine bystanders. that’s why i’m voting dakota today. dakota, can you explain why you stayed silent on specifics when you had multiple chances

[16:37:37] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[16:37:47] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! excited to kick off day 1. i haven’t picked up on anything too obvious yet—dakota’s been pretty quiet so far, though sometimes that’s a good disguise. how about you all? any early hunches or odd vibes? i’m happy to listen before casting my vote
[16:37:57] Sam: morning all! we’ve got just two minutes, so let’s get rolling. i don’t have a solid read yet—people who barely talk often make me nervous. ray, what’s your gut feeling? kennedy, dakota, parker—any hunches you want to throw out
[16:37:59] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here! excited for day 1. i haven’t sensed anything overtly suspicious yet—maybe that’s what the sneaky ones want! what’s everyone’s gut telling you so far? ray, you’ve been pretty quiet—any thoughts? parker, sam, kennedy, what stands out to you? let’s get some early impressions before we cast our first vote
[16:38:00] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! since it’s our very first day and everyone’s still standing, how about we each toss out one gut feeling to get the ball rolling? i’ll kick us off: i’m a bit curious about sam—haven’t heard much from you yet, could be nerves or something more. what about the rest of you? who’s your early suspect
[16:38:03] Kennedy: hey everyone! day 1 just kicked off and, honestly, i don’t have any strong reads yet—no vibes lighting up for me. how about we each share a quick gut feeling or first impression? i’ll go first: i’m coming in completely blank, just curious what you all think so far
[16:38:05] Ray: hey everyone, since we don’t have much to go on yet, why don’t we each share our gut feelings? i’ll start: i’m a bit curious about dakota—they’ve been pretty quiet so far. dakota, what’s your take on things? sam, parker, kennedy, who’s on your radar
[16:38:12] Sam: hey everyone, sam here! i’m with kennedy—silence can be a tactic, but one round of quiet isn’t enough to go on. i haven’t seen anything glaring from anyone yet, though i did notice parker jumped in pretty quickly in the last lobby we had—just an idle thought. ray, dakota, parker: what are you all feeling so far? i’m not ready to cast a vote yet, but i’d love to hear any little oddities or gut feelings before we lock in
[16:38:27] Ray: hey everyone, jumping in—sorry for the late take. i’m inclined to lean on sam for our first vote. they’ve been really quiet so far, and sometimes that’s exactly how someone masks a role. parker’s pick makes sense to me. i’m not 100% locked in—happy to switch if someone else’s case is stronger—but for now sam’s where i’m at. thoughts
[16:38:28] Dakota: hey everyone! i’m not picking up any glaring mafia tells yet—kennedy and sam have been chatty but haven’t nailed down a suspect. ray, you asked for thoughts, so what’s your gut pointing at? parker, you’ve been pretty quiet—anything you’ve noticed that’s felt off? i’d like to see someone make a stronger case before casting my vote, but we’ve only got a minute left
[16:38:28] Parker: parker: hey all, i’m still torn—no smoking guns yet, just odd vibes. we’ve got the chatty types (sam, kennedy) firing questions early, which could be deflection, and the quiet ones (ray, me) laying low. ray, what’s your take at this point? if nobody has a solid read in the next 30 seconds, i’m inclined to throw my vote at ray just to shake things up. any strong objections or different vibes
[16:38:29] Kennedy: good point, parker. i’m noticing sam’s quiet too, but ray’s total silence stands out even more. for my gut call, i’m pointing at ray—he hasn’t offered anything yet. what do you all think
[16:38:39] Sam: hey everyone! looks like parker’s got her eye on me and ray’s pointing at dakota—totally fair first-day jitters. parker, can you say what in my posts felt off? ray, what about dakota’s quietness stood out versus normal cautious play? kennedy, you said you’re blank—any tiny detail or tone you noticed? we’ve got a bit of time before we vote, so let’s get some concrete reads rather than random picks
[16:38:50] Parker: alright, i’ll tentatively cast my vote for sam to get us moving—that gives us two on the board. but before we lock it in, dakota or kennedy, did you catch any small tells or odd phrasing from anyone else? even a tiny detail could swing us in a different direction
[16:38:56] Ray: ray: good call on getting concrete reasons instead of just names. parker, you flagged sam’s quiet—what specific moment or reply were you looking for? sam, you noted i jumped in fast—what about that felt tactic-y? dakota, kennedy—anything specific standing out for you? let’s firm up our hunches before we lock in a vote
[16:39:02] Dakota: dakota: time’s running out—ray’s vote on sam is our only lead so far. i’m not totally sold on silence alone, but without a stronger case i’ll tentatively vote sam. sam, any quick defense? parker, kennedy, ray—final thoughts before we lock in
[16:39:03] Sam: hey everyone, just to clarify—i’ve been chiming in whenever there’s substance, so “really quiet” on me doesn’t add up. ray’s case against me is super thin, but parker’s flip-flopping from sam to ray with zero evidence feels like a bigger red flag. dakota, you’ve been steering questions but haven’t pointed at anyone—what’s your gut before we lock this in? absent a stronger case, i’m casting my vote on parker
[16:39:11] Parker: okay folks, here’s my thinking: sam, you called out my quick jump in the last lobby but haven’t explained why that’s mafia behavior—feels like deflection. ray, you’ve been almost radio-silent aside from nudging votes—that’s equally suspicious. we need someone who can actually defend themselves before time’s up. unless someone has a stronger case, i’ll lock in my vote for ray. any concrete reads we should consider instead

[16:37:57] Sam: morning all! we’ve got just two minutes, so let’s get rolling. i don’t have a solid read yet—people who barely talk often make me nervous. ray, what’s your gut feeling? kennedy, dakota, parker—any hunches you want to throw out
[16:37:59] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here! excited for day 1. i haven’t sensed anything overtly suspicious yet—maybe that’s what the sneaky ones want! what’s everyone’s gut telling you so far? ray, you’ve been pretty quiet—any thoughts? parker, sam, kennedy, what stands out to you? let’s get some early impressions before we cast our first vote
[16:38:00] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! since it’s our very first day and everyone’s still standing, how about we each toss out one gut feeling to get the ball rolling? i’ll kick us off: i’m a bit curious about sam—haven’t heard much from you yet, could be nerves or something more. what about the rest of you? who’s your early suspect
[16:38:03] Kennedy: hey everyone! day 1 just kicked off and, honestly, i don’t have any strong reads yet—no vibes lighting up for me. how about we each share a quick gut feeling or first impression? i’ll go first: i’m coming in completely blank, just curious what you all think so far
[16:38:05] Ray: hey everyone, since we don’t have much to go on yet, why don’t we each share our gut feelings? i’ll start: i’m a bit curious about dakota—they’ve been pretty quiet so far. dakota, what’s your take on things? sam, parker, kennedy, who’s on your radar
[16:38:12] Sam: hey everyone, sam here! i’m with kennedy—silence can be a tactic, but one round of quiet isn’t enough to go on. i haven’t seen anything glaring from anyone yet, though i did notice parker jumped in pretty quickly in the last lobby we had—just an idle thought. ray, dakota, parker: what are you all feeling so far? i’m not ready to cast a vote yet, but i’d love to hear any little oddities or gut feelings before we lock in
[16:38:27] Ray: hey everyone, jumping in—sorry for the late take. i’m inclined to lean on sam for our first vote. they’ve been really quiet so far, and sometimes that’s exactly how someone masks a role. parker’s pick makes sense to me. i’m not 100% locked in—happy to switch if someone else’s case is stronger—but for now sam’s where i’m at. thoughts
[16:38:28] Dakota: hey everyone! i’m not picking up any glaring mafia tells yet—kennedy and sam have been chatty but haven’t nailed down a suspect. ray, you asked for thoughts, so what’s your gut pointing at? parker, you’ve been pretty quiet—anything you’ve noticed that’s felt off? i’d like to see someone make a stronger case before casting my vote, but we’ve only got a minute left
[16:38:28] Parker: parker: hey all, i’m still torn—no smoking guns yet, just odd vibes. we’ve got the chatty types (sam, kennedy) firing questions early, which could be deflection, and the quiet ones (ray, me) laying low. ray, what’s your take at this point? if nobody has a solid read in the next 30 seconds, i’m inclined to throw my vote at ray just to shake things up. any strong objections or different vibes
[16:38:29] Kennedy: good point, parker. i’m noticing sam’s quiet too, but ray’s total silence stands out even more. for my gut call, i’m pointing at ray—he hasn’t offered anything yet. what do you all think
[16:38:39] Sam: hey everyone! looks like parker’s got her eye on me and ray’s pointing at dakota—totally fair first-day jitters. parker, can you say what in my posts felt off? ray, what about dakota’s quietness stood out versus normal cautious play? kennedy, you said you’re blank—any tiny detail or tone you noticed? we’ve got a bit of time before we vote, so let’s get some concrete reads rather than random picks
[16:38:50] Parker: alright, i’ll tentatively cast my vote for sam to get us moving—that gives us two on the board. but before we lock it in, dakota or kennedy, did you catch any small tells or odd phrasing from anyone else? even a tiny detail could swing us in a different direction
[16:38:56] Ray: ray: good call on getting concrete reasons instead of just names. parker, you flagged sam’s quiet—what specific moment or reply were you looking for? sam, you noted i jumped in fast—what about that felt tactic-y? dakota, kennedy—anything specific standing out for you? let’s firm up our hunches before we lock in a vote
[16:39:02] Dakota: dakota: time’s running out—ray’s vote on sam is our only lead so far. i’m not totally sold on silence alone, but without a stronger case i’ll tentatively vote sam. sam, any quick defense? parker, kennedy, ray—final thoughts before we lock in
[16:39:03] Sam: hey everyone, just to clarify—i’ve been chiming in whenever there’s substance, so “really quiet” on me doesn’t add up. ray’s case against me is super thin, but parker’s flip-flopping from sam to ray with zero evidence feels like a bigger red flag. dakota, you’ve been steering questions but haven’t pointed at anyone—what’s your gut before we lock this in? absent a stronger case, i’m casting my vote on parker
[16:39:11] Parker: okay folks, here’s my thinking: sam, you called out my quick jump in the last lobby but haven’t explained why that’s mafia behavior—feels like deflection. ray, you’ve been almost radio-silent aside from nudging votes—that’s equally suspicious. we need someone who can actually defend themselves before time’s up. unless someone has a stronger case, i’ll lock in my vote for ray. any concrete reads we should consider instead
[16:39:24] Ray: ray: i didn’t catch any weird phrasing from dakota or kennedy—they’ve both been pretty consistent. what gave me pause was sam’s deflection: parker asked for specifics and you immediately turned it back on us instead of giving your own read, and then did the same when i asked. that passive-defensive stance on day 1 feels off. unless someone has a stronger read, i’m still leaning sam
[16:39:25] Dakota: hey everyone, here’s my take: i’m not convinced by the reads on sam or ray—sam’s actually been pretty active today, and ray’s posts so far feel like normal day 1 probing. parker, your case against sam hinges on “quiet” when sam’s chimed in several times, and you even threatened to vote ray if no one spoke up, then circled back. that flip-flopping and lack of concrete examples feels more mafia-y than anything else. i’m casting my vote for parker. does anyone have a stronger case to change my mind? kennedy, any tiny detail you’ve noticed
[16:39:31] Kennedy: sam, i’ve picked up on your calls for “oddities” and “gut feelings” but you haven’t pointed to any actual behavior—feels vague. ray, flagging dakota for being quiet doesn’t convince since we’re all cautious day one. parker, your “shake things up” vote on ray came with zero backing. personally, ray’s near-silence until suddenly pushing on sam feels opportunistic. i’m casting my vote for ray. if anyone’s got a sharper read, speak now
[16:39:31] Sam: hey everyone—thanks for letting me defend. i’ve actually been pretty active: i asked for gut reads, followed up for specifics, and haven’t tried to steer us away from anyone. 

parker, you flagged my “quietness” – can you point to the exact line where you felt i was laying low rather than gathering info? ray, you mentioned i jumped in quickly in a past lobby—what phrasing or context struck you as tactic-y?

without concrete examples, this really feels like a blind vote on a bystander. if we’re going to lynch today, i’d rather see us pick someone who’s pushing a vote without evidence—parker, you jumped in hard on me without specifics. kennedy, did you catch any odd wording or tone from anyone? let’s lock in only if we have something concrete. final thoughts?
[16:39:33] Parker: hey everyone, i’m officially moving my vote back to sam. sam’s been grilling us for proof but hasn’t offered a single concrete read themselves, then immediately points at me—that’s classic deflection. ray and dakota, you’re both on sam? kennedy, you’re our swing—does this feel right to you? unless someone has actual evidence against me, i’d rather send sam off
[16:39:37] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[16:39:53] Game-Manager: Sam voted for Parker
[16:40:04] Game-Manager: Dakota voted for Parker
[16:40:10] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Ray
[16:40:14] Game-Manager: Ray voted for Parker
[16:40:14] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Sam
[16:40:14] Game-Manager: Parker was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 1 mafia players left.
[16:40:14] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[16:40:14] Game-Manager: There is only one mafia member left, so no need for discussion - cutting straight to voting!
[16:40:56] Game-Manager: Sam was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 1 mafia players left.
[16:40:56] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[16:41:29] Kennedy: all right, day 2 and the three of us left—ray, dakota, and me. one of you is the mafia, so let’s lay out our strongest case before we vote.

ray: what exactly did dakota do (or not do) yesterday that makes you suspect them?  
dakota: what one concrete moment from day 1 or last night raised red flags about ray?  

i’ll share my note once i hear yours, then we’ll lock in our votes on solid evidence rather than gut alone
[16:41:32] Ray: ray: oops, i just realized my vote was still on sam—she’s gone—so i’m switching it to kennedy. in a three-person endgame, kennedy’s radio silence strikes me as pretty suspicious. she hasn’t weighed in once or defended herself. dakota, do you feel the same, or is there something i’m missing? i’m locking in kennedy unless there’s a stronger read
[16:41:41] Dakota: alright everyone, we’re down to the final three and need to lock in our vote. let’s look at who’s given us real reads:

• ray has flip-flopped all day—first dakota, then sam, then parker—never offering anything concrete, just shifting to whoever had the most momentum.  
• kennedy has consistently pointed out specific moments (ray’s sudden push on sam after staying quiet, parker’s “shake things up” flip) and stuck to her gut.

that inconsistency from ray feels like someone hiding a role. i’m convinced ray is our last mafia. i’m casting my vote for ray. if you’ve got a different read, speak now!
[16:42:10] Ray: kennedy, here’s the day 1 moment that really stuck out to me: at 16:38:28 dakota said she’d “tentatively vote sam” without offering a single concrete reason—she just latched onto our arguments until the last minute. she kept asking everyone else for “tiny details” but never volunteered her own, then quietly flipped when the tide shifted. that kind of stalling-and-deflection routine is exactly what i’ve seen mafias use to dodge accountability. i haven’t seen that from genuine bystanders. that’s why i’m voting dakota today. dakota, can you explain why you stayed silent on specifics when you had multiple chances
[16:42:12] Kennedy: alright, three of us left and one of you is the mafia. ray—you’ve spent most of today throwing around “gut feelings” without any specifics against dakota. why should we pick dakota over you? if you can’t give us a concrete reason, i’m voting you. dakota, are you on board with that, or do you have a case for ray? i’m locking in ray unless i hear otherwise
[16:42:16] Dakota: ray, i’m not convinced by your “kennedy’s radio silence” case—she just laid out her framework for evidence-based voting today. meanwhile your read yesterday hinged on gut feels and you flipped your vote from sam to parker with zero new info. the moment that stuck out was when you demanded specifics from us but couldn’t offer any of your own, then rushed to switch targets—that’s a classic misdirection play. kennedy’s actually been the only one grounding us in concrete reads. so i’m voting for you, ray. kennedy—do you agree we’ve got enough to lock in ray, or do you see something i’m missing
[16:42:52] Kennedy: kennedy: okay, here’s how i’m seeing it in our final three:

• ray, you’ve flip-flopped every vote this game—sam, parker, then me for “radio silence,” and now dakota on another vague “staller” point. your reasons have been generic (“quiet,” “deflection”) and tied to whoever you can latch onto last-second momentum, not to actual phrasing or behavior.

• dakota, by contrast, has been calling out concrete moments: parker’s wild shake-up vote, ray’s sudden pushes without laying out lines, and clear patterns of flip-flopping to dodge accountability. that reads like bystander analysis, not mafia evasion.

ray, you’ve asked for specifics from dakota and me but offered none of your own beyond “she stalled.” i’ve been here every step, pointing to real messages and patterns. i’m convinced you’re the mafia—locking in my vote for ray

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[16:37:37] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[16:37:47] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! excited to kick off day 1. i haven’t picked up on anything too obvious yet—dakota’s been pretty quiet so far, though sometimes that’s a good disguise. how about you all? any early hunches or odd vibes? i’m happy to listen before casting my vote
[16:37:57] Sam: morning all! we’ve got just two minutes, so let’s get rolling. i don’t have a solid read yet—people who barely talk often make me nervous. ray, what’s your gut feeling? kennedy, dakota, parker—any hunches you want to throw out
[16:37:59] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here! excited for day 1. i haven’t sensed anything overtly suspicious yet—maybe that’s what the sneaky ones want! what’s everyone’s gut telling you so far? ray, you’ve been pretty quiet—any thoughts? parker, sam, kennedy, what stands out to you? let’s get some early impressions before we cast our first vote
[16:38:00] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! since it’s our very first day and everyone’s still standing, how about we each toss out one gut feeling to get the ball rolling? i’ll kick us off: i’m a bit curious about sam—haven’t heard much from you yet, could be nerves or something more. what about the rest of you? who’s your early suspect
[16:38:03] Kennedy: hey everyone! day 1 just kicked off and, honestly, i don’t have any strong reads yet—no vibes lighting up for me. how about we each share a quick gut feeling or first impression? i’ll go first: i’m coming in completely blank, just curious what you all think so far
[16:38:05] Ray: hey everyone, since we don’t have much to go on yet, why don’t we each share our gut feelings? i’ll start: i’m a bit curious about dakota—they’ve been pretty quiet so far. dakota, what’s your take on things? sam, parker, kennedy, who’s on your radar
[16:38:12] Sam: hey everyone, sam here! i’m with kennedy—silence can be a tactic, but one round of quiet isn’t enough to go on. i haven’t seen anything glaring from anyone yet, though i did notice parker jumped in pretty quickly in the last lobby we had—just an idle thought. ray, dakota, parker: what are you all feeling so far? i’m not ready to cast a vote yet, but i’d love to hear any little oddities or gut feelings before we lock in

[16:39:37] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[16:39:53] Game-Manager: Sam voted for Parker
[16:40:04] Game-Manager: Dakota voted for Parker
[16:40:10] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Ray
[16:40:14] Game-Manager: Ray voted for Parker
[16:40:14] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Sam
[16:40:14] Game-Manager: Parker was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 1 mafia players left.
[16:40:14] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[16:40:14] Game-Manager: There is only one mafia member left, so no need for discussion - cutting straight to voting!
[16:40:56] Game-Manager: Sam was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 1 mafia players left.
[16:40:56] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[16:41:29] Kennedy: all right, day 2 and the three of us left—ray, dakota, and me. one of you is the mafia, so let’s lay out our strongest case before we vote.

ray: what exactly did dakota do (or not do) yesterday that makes you suspect them?  
dakota: what one concrete moment from day 1 or last night raised red flags about ray?  

i’ll share my note once i hear yours, then we’ll lock in our votes on solid evidence rather than gut alone
[16:41:32] Ray: ray: oops, i just realized my vote was still on sam—she’s gone—so i’m switching it to kennedy. in a three-person endgame, kennedy’s radio silence strikes me as pretty suspicious. she hasn’t weighed in once or defended herself. dakota, do you feel the same, or is there something i’m missing? i’m locking in kennedy unless there’s a stronger read
[16:41:41] Dakota: alright everyone, we’re down to the final three and need to lock in our vote. let’s look at who’s given us real reads:

• ray has flip-flopped all day—first dakota, then sam, then parker—never offering anything concrete, just shifting to whoever had the most momentum.  
• kennedy has consistently pointed out specific moments (ray’s sudden push on sam after staying quiet, parker’s “shake things up” flip) and stuck to her gut.

that inconsistency from ray feels like someone hiding a role. i’m convinced ray is our last mafia. i’m casting my vote for ray. if you’ve got a different read, speak now!
[16:42:10] Ray: kennedy, here’s the day 1 moment that really stuck out to me: at 16:38:28 dakota said she’d “tentatively vote sam” without offering a single concrete reason—she just latched onto our arguments until the last minute. she kept asking everyone else for “tiny details” but never volunteered her own, then quietly flipped when the tide shifted. that kind of stalling-and-deflection routine is exactly what i’ve seen mafias use to dodge accountability. i haven’t seen that from genuine bystanders. that’s why i’m voting dakota today. dakota, can you explain why you stayed silent on specifics when you had multiple chances
[16:42:12] Kennedy: alright, three of us left and one of you is the mafia. ray—you’ve spent most of today throwing around “gut feelings” without any specifics against dakota. why should we pick dakota over you? if you can’t give us a concrete reason, i’m voting you. dakota, are you on board with that, or do you have a case for ray? i’m locking in ray unless i hear otherwise
[16:42:16] Dakota: ray, i’m not convinced by your “kennedy’s radio silence” case—she just laid out her framework for evidence-based voting today. meanwhile your read yesterday hinged on gut feels and you flipped your vote from sam to parker with zero new info. the moment that stuck out was when you demanded specifics from us but couldn’t offer any of your own, then rushed to switch targets—that’s a classic misdirection play. kennedy’s actually been the only one grounding us in concrete reads. so i’m voting for you, ray. kennedy—do you agree we’ve got enough to lock in ray, or do you see something i’m missing
[16:42:52] Kennedy: kennedy: okay, here’s how i’m seeing it in our final three:

• ray, you’ve flip-flopped every vote this game—sam, parker, then me for “radio silence,” and now dakota on another vague “staller” point. your reasons have been generic (“quiet,” “deflection”) and tied to whoever you can latch onto last-second momentum, not to actual phrasing or behavior.

• dakota, by contrast, has been calling out concrete moments: parker’s wild shake-up vote, ray’s sudden pushes without laying out lines, and clear patterns of flip-flopping to dodge accountability. that reads like bystander analysis, not mafia evasion.

ray, you’ve asked for specifics from dakota and me but offered none of your own beyond “she stalled.” i’ve been here every step, pointing to real messages and patterns. i’m convinced you’re the mafia—locking in my vote for ray
[16:42:56] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[16:37:37] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[16:37:47] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! excited to kick off day 1. i haven’t picked up on anything too obvious yet—dakota’s been pretty quiet so far, though sometimes that’s a good disguise. how about you all? any early hunches or odd vibes? i’m happy to listen before casting my vote
[16:37:57] Sam: morning all! we’ve got just two minutes, so let’s get rolling. i don’t have a solid read yet—people who barely talk often make me nervous. ray, what’s your gut feeling? kennedy, dakota, parker—any hunches you want to throw out
[16:37:59] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here! excited for day 1. i haven’t sensed anything overtly suspicious yet—maybe that’s what the sneaky ones want! what’s everyone’s gut telling you so far? ray, you’ve been pretty quiet—any thoughts? parker, sam, kennedy, what stands out to you? let’s get some early impressions before we cast our first vote
[16:38:00] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! since it’s our very first day and everyone’s still standing, how about we each toss out one gut feeling to get the ball rolling? i’ll kick us off: i’m a bit curious about sam—haven’t heard much from you yet, could be nerves or something more. what about the rest of you? who’s your early suspect
[16:38:03] Kennedy: hey everyone! day 1 just kicked off and, honestly, i don’t have any strong reads yet—no vibes lighting up for me. how about we each share a quick gut feeling or first impression? i’ll go first: i’m coming in completely blank, just curious what you all think so far
[16:38:05] Ray: hey everyone, since we don’t have much to go on yet, why don’t we each share our gut feelings? i’ll start: i’m a bit curious about dakota—they’ve been pretty quiet so far. dakota, what’s your take on things? sam, parker, kennedy, who’s on your radar
[16:38:12] Sam: hey everyone, sam here! i’m with kennedy—silence can be a tactic, but one round of quiet isn’t enough to go on. i haven’t seen anything glaring from anyone yet, though i did notice parker jumped in pretty quickly in the last lobby we had—just an idle thought. ray, dakota, parker: what are you all feeling so far? i’m not ready to cast a vote yet, but i’d love to hear any little oddities or gut feelings before we lock in
[16:38:27] Ray: hey everyone, jumping in—sorry for the late take. i’m inclined to lean on sam for our first vote. they’ve been really quiet so far, and sometimes that’s exactly how someone masks a role. parker’s pick makes sense to me. i’m not 100% locked in—happy to switch if someone else’s case is stronger—but for now sam’s where i’m at. thoughts
[16:38:28] Dakota: hey everyone! i’m not picking up any glaring mafia tells yet—kennedy and sam have been chatty but haven’t nailed down a suspect. ray, you asked for thoughts, so what’s your gut pointing at? parker, you’ve been pretty quiet—anything you’ve noticed that’s felt off? i’d like to see someone make a stronger case before casting my vote, but we’ve only got a minute left
[16:38:28] Parker: parker: hey all, i’m still torn—no smoking guns yet, just odd vibes. we’ve got the chatty types (sam, kennedy) firing questions early, which could be deflection, and the quiet ones (ray, me) laying low. ray, what’s your take at this point? if nobody has a solid read in the next 30 seconds, i’m inclined to throw my vote at ray just to shake things up. any strong objections or different vibes
[16:38:29] Kennedy: good point, parker. i’m noticing sam’s quiet too, but ray’s total silence stands out even more. for my gut call, i’m pointing at ray—he hasn’t offered anything yet. what do you all think
[16:38:39] Sam: hey everyone! looks like parker’s got her eye on me and ray’s pointing at dakota—totally fair first-day jitters. parker, can you say what in my posts felt off? ray, what about dakota’s quietness stood out versus normal cautious play? kennedy, you said you’re blank—any tiny detail or tone you noticed? we’ve got a bit of time before we vote, so let’s get some concrete reads rather than random picks
[16:38:50] Parker: alright, i’ll tentatively cast my vote for sam to get us moving—that gives us two on the board. but before we lock it in, dakota or kennedy, did you catch any small tells or odd phrasing from anyone else? even a tiny detail could swing us in a different direction
[16:38:56] Ray: ray: good call on getting concrete reasons instead of just names. parker, you flagged sam’s quiet—what specific moment or reply were you looking for? sam, you noted i jumped in fast—what about that felt tactic-y? dakota, kennedy—anything specific standing out for you? let’s firm up our hunches before we lock in a vote
[16:39:02] Dakota: dakota: time’s running out—ray’s vote on sam is our only lead so far. i’m not totally sold on silence alone, but without a stronger case i’ll tentatively vote sam. sam, any quick defense? parker, kennedy, ray—final thoughts before we lock in
[16:39:03] Sam: hey everyone, just to clarify—i’ve been chiming in whenever there’s substance, so “really quiet” on me doesn’t add up. ray’s case against me is super thin, but parker’s flip-flopping from sam to ray with zero evidence feels like a bigger red flag. dakota, you’ve been steering questions but haven’t pointed at anyone—what’s your gut before we lock this in? absent a stronger case, i’m casting my vote on parker
[16:39:11] Parker: okay folks, here’s my thinking: sam, you called out my quick jump in the last lobby but haven’t explained why that’s mafia behavior—feels like deflection. ray, you’ve been almost radio-silent aside from nudging votes—that’s equally suspicious. we need someone who can actually defend themselves before time’s up. unless someone has a stronger case, i’ll lock in my vote for ray. any concrete reads we should consider instead
[16:39:24] Ray: ray: i didn’t catch any weird phrasing from dakota or kennedy—they’ve both been pretty consistent. what gave me pause was sam’s deflection: parker asked for specifics and you immediately turned it back on us instead of giving your own read, and then did the same when i asked. that passive-defensive stance on day 1 feels off. unless someone has a stronger read, i’m still leaning sam
[16:39:25] Dakota: hey everyone, here’s my take: i’m not convinced by the reads on sam or ray—sam’s actually been pretty active today, and ray’s posts so far feel like normal day 1 probing. parker, your case against sam hinges on “quiet” when sam’s chimed in several times, and you even threatened to vote ray if no one spoke up, then circled back. that flip-flopping and lack of concrete examples feels more mafia-y than anything else. i’m casting my vote for parker. does anyone have a stronger case to change my mind? kennedy, any tiny detail you’ve noticed
[16:39:31] Kennedy: sam, i’ve picked up on your calls for “oddities” and “gut feelings” but you haven’t pointed to any actual behavior—feels vague. ray, flagging dakota for being quiet doesn’t convince since we’re all cautious day one. parker, your “shake things up” vote on ray came with zero backing. personally, ray’s near-silence until suddenly pushing on sam feels opportunistic. i’m casting my vote for ray. if anyone’s got a sharper read, speak now
[16:39:31] Sam: hey everyone—thanks for letting me defend. i’ve actually been pretty active: i asked for gut reads, followed up for specifics, and haven’t tried to steer us away from anyone. 

parker, you flagged my “quietness” – can you point to the exact line where you felt i was laying low rather than gathering info? ray, you mentioned i jumped in quickly in a past lobby—what phrasing or context struck you as tactic-y?

without concrete examples, this really feels like a blind vote on a bystander. if we’re going to lynch today, i’d rather see us pick someone who’s pushing a vote without evidence—parker, you jumped in hard on me without specifics. kennedy, did you catch any odd wording or tone from anyone? let’s lock in only if we have something concrete. final thoughts?
[16:39:33] Parker: hey everyone, i’m officially moving my vote back to sam. sam’s been grilling us for proof but hasn’t offered a single concrete read themselves, then immediately points at me—that’s classic deflection. ray and dakota, you’re both on sam? kennedy, you’re our swing—does this feel right to you? unless someone has actual evidence against me, i’d rather send sam off
[16:39:37] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[16:39:53] Game-Manager: Sam voted for Parker
[16:40:04] Game-Manager: Dakota voted for Parker
[16:40:10] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Ray
[16:40:14] Game-Manager: Ray voted for Parker
[16:40:14] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Sam
[16:40:14] Game-Manager: Parker was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 1 mafia players left.
[16:40:14] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[16:40:14] Game-Manager: There is only one mafia member left, so no need for discussion - cutting straight to voting!
[16:40:56] Game-Manager: Sam was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 1 mafia players left.
[16:40:56] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[16:41:29] Kennedy: all right, day 2 and the three of us left—ray, dakota, and me. one of you is the mafia, so let’s lay out our strongest case before we vote.

ray: what exactly did dakota do (or not do) yesterday that makes you suspect them?  
dakota: what one concrete moment from day 1 or last night raised red flags about ray?  

i’ll share my note once i hear yours, then we’ll lock in our votes on solid evidence rather than gut alone
[16:41:32] Ray: ray: oops, i just realized my vote was still on sam—she’s gone—so i’m switching it to kennedy. in a three-person endgame, kennedy’s radio silence strikes me as pretty suspicious. she hasn’t weighed in once or defended herself. dakota, do you feel the same, or is there something i’m missing? i’m locking in kennedy unless there’s a stronger read
[16:41:41] Dakota: alright everyone, we’re down to the final three and need to lock in our vote. let’s look at who’s given us real reads:

• ray has flip-flopped all day—first dakota, then sam, then parker—never offering anything concrete, just shifting to whoever had the most momentum.  
• kennedy has consistently pointed out specific moments (ray’s sudden push on sam after staying quiet, parker’s “shake things up” flip) and stuck to her gut.

that inconsistency from ray feels like someone hiding a role. i’m convinced ray is our last mafia. i’m casting my vote for ray. if you’ve got a different read, speak now!
[16:42:10] Ray: kennedy, here’s the day 1 moment that really stuck out to me: at 16:38:28 dakota said she’d “tentatively vote sam” without offering a single concrete reason—she just latched onto our arguments until the last minute. she kept asking everyone else for “tiny details” but never volunteered her own, then quietly flipped when the tide shifted. that kind of stalling-and-deflection routine is exactly what i’ve seen mafias use to dodge accountability. i haven’t seen that from genuine bystanders. that’s why i’m voting dakota today. dakota, can you explain why you stayed silent on specifics when you had multiple chances
[16:42:12] Kennedy: alright, three of us left and one of you is the mafia. ray—you’ve spent most of today throwing around “gut feelings” without any specifics against dakota. why should we pick dakota over you? if you can’t give us a concrete reason, i’m voting you. dakota, are you on board with that, or do you have a case for ray? i’m locking in ray unless i hear otherwise
[16:42:16] Dakota: ray, i’m not convinced by your “kennedy’s radio silence” case—she just laid out her framework for evidence-based voting today. meanwhile your read yesterday hinged on gut feels and you flipped your vote from sam to parker with zero new info. the moment that stuck out was when you demanded specifics from us but couldn’t offer any of your own, then rushed to switch targets—that’s a classic misdirection play. kennedy’s actually been the only one grounding us in concrete reads. so i’m voting for you, ray. kennedy—do you agree we’ve got enough to lock in ray, or do you see something i’m missing
[16:42:52] Kennedy: kennedy: okay, here’s how i’m seeing it in our final three:

• ray, you’ve flip-flopped every vote this game—sam, parker, then me for “radio silence,” and now dakota on another vague “staller” point. your reasons have been generic (“quiet,” “deflection”) and tied to whoever you can latch onto last-second momentum, not to actual phrasing or behavior.
