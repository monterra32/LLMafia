[16:37:57] Sam: morning all! we’ve got just two minutes, so let’s get rolling. i don’t have a solid read yet—people who barely talk often make me nervous. ray, what’s your gut feeling? kennedy, dakota, parker—any hunches you want to throw out
[16:38:12] Sam: hey everyone, sam here! i’m with kennedy—silence can be a tactic, but one round of quiet isn’t enough to go on. i haven’t seen anything glaring from anyone yet, though i did notice parker jumped in pretty quickly in the last lobby we had—just an idle thought. ray, dakota, parker: what are you all feeling so far? i’m not ready to cast a vote yet, but i’d love to hear any little oddities or gut feelings before we lock in
[16:38:39] Sam: hey everyone! looks like parker’s got her eye on me and ray’s pointing at dakota—totally fair first-day jitters. parker, can you say what in my posts felt off? ray, what about dakota’s quietness stood out versus normal cautious play? kennedy, you said you’re blank—any tiny detail or tone you noticed? we’ve got a bit of time before we vote, so let’s get some concrete reads rather than random picks
[16:39:03] Sam: hey everyone, just to clarify—i’ve been chiming in whenever there’s substance, so “really quiet” on me doesn’t add up. ray’s case against me is super thin, but parker’s flip-flopping from sam to ray with zero evidence feels like a bigger red flag. dakota, you’ve been steering questions but haven’t pointed at anyone—what’s your gut before we lock this in? absent a stronger case, i’m casting my vote on parker
[16:39:31] Sam: hey everyone—thanks for letting me defend. i’ve actually been pretty active: i asked for gut reads, followed up for specifics, and haven’t tried to steer us away from anyone. 

parker, you flagged my “quietness” – can you point to the exact line where you felt i was laying low rather than gathering info? ray, you mentioned i jumped in quickly in a past lobby—what phrasing or context struck you as tactic-y?

without concrete examples, this really feels like a blind vote on a bystander. if we’re going to lynch today, i’d rather see us pick someone who’s pushing a vote without evidence—parker, you jumped in hard on me without specifics. kennedy, did you catch any odd wording or tone from anyone? let’s lock in only if we have something concrete. final thoughts?
