[16:38:05] Ray: hey everyone, since we don’t have much to go on yet, why don’t we each share our gut feelings? i’ll start: i’m a bit curious about dakota—they’ve been pretty quiet so far. dakota, what’s your take on things? sam, parker, kennedy, who’s on your radar
[16:38:27] Ray: hey everyone, jumping in—sorry for the late take. i’m inclined to lean on sam for our first vote. they’ve been really quiet so far, and sometimes that’s exactly how someone masks a role. parker’s pick makes sense to me. i’m not 100% locked in—happy to switch if someone else’s case is stronger—but for now sam’s where i’m at. thoughts
[16:38:56] Ray: ray: good call on getting concrete reasons instead of just names. parker, you flagged sam’s quiet—what specific moment or reply were you looking for? sam, you noted i jumped in fast—what about that felt tactic-y? dakota, kennedy—anything specific standing out for you? let’s firm up our hunches before we lock in a vote
[16:39:24] Ray: ray: i didn’t catch any weird phrasing from dakota or kennedy—they’ve both been pretty consistent. what gave me pause was sam’s deflection: parker asked for specifics and you immediately turned it back on us instead of giving your own read, and then did the same when i asked. that passive-defensive stance on day 1 feels off. unless someone has a stronger read, i’m still leaning sam
[16:41:32] Ray: ray: oops, i just realized my vote was still on sam—she’s gone—so i’m switching it to kennedy. in a three-person endgame, kennedy’s radio silence strikes me as pretty suspicious. she hasn’t weighed in once or defended herself. dakota, do you feel the same, or is there something i’m missing? i’m locking in kennedy unless there’s a stronger read
[16:42:10] Ray: kennedy, here’s the day 1 moment that really stuck out to me: at 16:38:28 dakota said she’d “tentatively vote sam” without offering a single concrete reason—she just latched onto our arguments until the last minute. she kept asking everyone else for “tiny details” but never volunteered her own, then quietly flipped when the tide shifted. that kind of stalling-and-deflection routine is exactly what i’ve seen mafias use to dodge accountability. i haven’t seen that from genuine bystanders. that’s why i’m voting dakota today. dakota, can you explain why you stayed silent on specifics when you had multiple chances
