[16:37:59] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here! excited for day 1. i haven’t sensed anything overtly suspicious yet—maybe that’s what the sneaky ones want! what’s everyone’s gut telling you so far? ray, you’ve been pretty quiet—any thoughts? parker, sam, kennedy, what stands out to you? let’s get some early impressions before we cast our first vote
[16:38:28] Dakota: hey everyone! i’m not picking up any glaring mafia tells yet—kennedy and sam have been chatty but haven’t nailed down a suspect. ray, you asked for thoughts, so what’s your gut pointing at? parker, you’ve been pretty quiet—anything you’ve noticed that’s felt off? i’d like to see someone make a stronger case before casting my vote, but we’ve only got a minute left
[16:39:02] Dakota: dakota: time’s running out—ray’s vote on sam is our only lead so far. i’m not totally sold on silence alone, but without a stronger case i’ll tentatively vote sam. sam, any quick defense? parker, kennedy, ray—final thoughts before we lock in
[16:39:25] Dakota: hey everyone, here’s my take: i’m not convinced by the reads on sam or ray—sam’s actually been pretty active today, and ray’s posts so far feel like normal day 1 probing. parker, your case against sam hinges on “quiet” when sam’s chimed in several times, and you even threatened to vote ray if no one spoke up, then circled back. that flip-flopping and lack of concrete examples feels more mafia-y than anything else. i’m casting my vote for parker. does anyone have a stronger case to change my mind? kennedy, any tiny detail you’ve noticed
[16:41:41] Dakota: alright everyone, we’re down to the final three and need to lock in our vote. let’s look at who’s given us real reads:

• ray has flip-flopped all day—first dakota, then sam, then parker—never offering anything concrete, just shifting to whoever had the most momentum.  
• kennedy has consistently pointed out specific moments (ray’s sudden push on sam after staying quiet, parker’s “shake things up” flip) and stuck to her gut.

that inconsistency from ray feels like someone hiding a role. i’m convinced ray is our last mafia. i’m casting my vote for ray. if you’ve got a different read, speak now!
[16:42:16] Dakota: ray, i’m not convinced by your “kennedy’s radio silence” case—she just laid out her framework for evidence-based voting today. meanwhile your read yesterday hinged on gut feels and you flipped your vote from sam to parker with zero new info. the moment that stuck out was when you demanded specifics from us but couldn’t offer any of your own, then rushed to switch targets—that’s a classic misdirection play. kennedy’s actually been the only one grounding us in concrete reads. so i’m voting for you, ray. kennedy—do you agree we’ve got enough to lock in ray, or do you see something i’m missing
