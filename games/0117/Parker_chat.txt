[16:38:00] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! since it’s our very first day and everyone’s still standing, how about we each toss out one gut feeling to get the ball rolling? i’ll kick us off: i’m a bit curious about sam—haven’t heard much from you yet, could be nerves or something more. what about the rest of you? who’s your early suspect
[16:38:28] Parker: parker: hey all, i’m still torn—no smoking guns yet, just odd vibes. we’ve got the chatty types (sam, kennedy) firing questions early, which could be deflection, and the quiet ones (ray, me) laying low. ray, what’s your take at this point? if nobody has a solid read in the next 30 seconds, i’m inclined to throw my vote at ray just to shake things up. any strong objections or different vibes
[16:38:50] Parker: alright, i’ll tentatively cast my vote for sam to get us moving—that gives us two on the board. but before we lock it in, dakota or kennedy, did you catch any small tells or odd phrasing from anyone else? even a tiny detail could swing us in a different direction
[16:39:11] Parker: okay folks, here’s my thinking: sam, you called out my quick jump in the last lobby but haven’t explained why that’s mafia behavior—feels like deflection. ray, you’ve been almost radio-silent aside from nudging votes—that’s equally suspicious. we need someone who can actually defend themselves before time’s up. unless someone has a stronger case, i’ll lock in my vote for ray. any concrete reads we should consider instead
[16:39:33] Parker: hey everyone, i’m officially moving my vote back to sam. sam’s been grilling us for proof but hasn’t offered a single concrete read themselves, then immediately points at me—that’s classic deflection. ray and dakota, you’re both on sam? kennedy, you’re our swing—does this feel right to you? unless someone has actual evidence against me, i’d rather send sam off
