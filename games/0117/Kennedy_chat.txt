[16:37:47] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! excited to kick off day 1. i haven’t picked up on anything too obvious yet—dakota’s been pretty quiet so far, though sometimes that’s a good disguise. how about you all? any early hunches or odd vibes? i’m happy to listen before casting my vote
[16:38:03] Kennedy: hey everyone! day 1 just kicked off and, honestly, i don’t have any strong reads yet—no vibes lighting up for me. how about we each share a quick gut feeling or first impression? i’ll go first: i’m coming in completely blank, just curious what you all think so far
[16:38:29] Kennedy: good point, parker. i’m noticing sam’s quiet too, but ray’s total silence stands out even more. for my gut call, i’m pointing at ray—he hasn’t offered anything yet. what do you all think
[16:39:31] Kennedy: sam, i’ve picked up on your calls for “oddities” and “gut feelings” but you haven’t pointed to any actual behavior—feels vague. ray, flagging dakota for being quiet doesn’t convince since we’re all cautious day one. parker, your “shake things up” vote on ray came with zero backing. personally, ray’s near-silence until suddenly pushing on sam feels opportunistic. i’m casting my vote for ray. if anyone’s got a sharper read, speak now
[16:41:29] Kennedy: all right, day 2 and the three of us left—ray, dakota, and me. one of you is the mafia, so let’s lay out our strongest case before we vote.

ray: what exactly did dakota do (or not do) yesterday that makes you suspect them?  
dakota: what one concrete moment from day 1 or last night raised red flags about ray?  

i’ll share my note once i hear yours, then we’ll lock in our votes on solid evidence rather than gut alone
[16:42:12] Kennedy: alright, three of us left and one of you is the mafia. ray—you’ve spent most of today throwing around “gut feelings” without any specifics against dakota. why should we pick dakota over you? if you can’t give us a concrete reason, i’m voting you. dakota, are you on board with that, or do you have a case for ray? i’m locking in ray unless i hear otherwise
[16:42:52] Kennedy: kennedy: okay, here’s how i’m seeing it in our final three:

• ray, you’ve flip-flopped every vote this game—sam, parker, then me for “radio silence,” and now dakota on another vague “staller” point. your reasons have been generic (“quiet,” “deflection”) and tied to whoever you can latch onto last-second momentum, not to actual phrasing or behavior.

• dakota, by contrast, has been calling out concrete moments: parker’s wild shake-up vote, ray’s sudden pushes without laying out lines, and clear patterns of flip-flopping to dodge accountability. that reads like bystander analysis, not mafia evasion.

ray, you’ve asked for specifics from dakota and me but offered none of your own beyond “she stalled.” i’ve been here every step, pointing to real messages and patterns. i’m convinced you’re the mafia—locking in my vote for ray
