[11:35:59] Dakota: hey everyone, excited to start hunting the mafia
[11:35:59] Sam: hey all, any early thoughts on who might be mafia
[11:36:01] Ray: morning everyone—any early suspicions
[11:36:03] Parker: morning everyone, any initial suspects
[11:36:10] Sam: hey everyone, let’s keep our eyes peeled for anyone acting suspicious
[11:36:11] Kennedy: hey everyone, any initial suspicions on who the mafia might be
[11:36:15] Parker: kennedy’s been awfully quiet—does that strike anyone else as odd
[11:36:23] Ray: hey sam, parker’s awfully quiet so far, doesn’t that seem suspicious
[11:36:32] Ray: i’m with parker—kennedy’s unusually quiet and might be laying low
[11:36:41] Kennedy: anyone else think dakota’s enthusiasm is a bit suspicious
[11:36:47] Dakota: yeah parker, what exactly about kennedy’s quietness seems off to you
[11:36:51] Parker: i’ve already spoken twice; what part of that seems quiet to you, ray
[11:37:04] Dakota: kennedy, can you explain what’s suspicious about my enthusiasm
[11:37:07] Kennedy: sorry for being quiet—i just find parker’s sudden focus on me odd, any thoughts
[11:37:09] Parker: they’ve asked nothing but questions and haven’t proposed a single suspect, which feels suspicious
[11:37:20] Kennedy: dakota, your rapid defense makes me wonder what you’re hiding
[11:37:30] Dakota: parker's defensive tone seems suspicious
[11:37:33] Sam: kennedy's silence feels more calculated than dakota's enthusiasm
[11:37:40] Ray: you only jumped in after dakota pressed you for details, parker
[11:37:46] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[11:38:03] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Kennedy
[11:38:05] Game-Manager: Dakota voted for Parker
[11:38:07] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Parker
[11:38:12] Game-Manager: Ray voted for Parker
[11:38:15] Game-Manager: Sam voted for Kennedy
[11:39:50] Dakota: dakota: any theories why the mafia picked off kennedy last night
[11:39:57] Ray: sam’s lone vote for kennedy still strikes me as odd
[11:40:08] Sam: with only one mafia left, ray’s silence feels suspicious
[11:40:21] Dakota: sam, are you leaning towards ray or me as the mafia
[11:40:25] Ray: mafia probably killed kennedy to frame sam for defending her
[11:40:34] Dakota: ray, you’ve been awfully silent today—what’s your read on who the remaining mafia might be
[11:40:34] Sam: odd that ray didn’t vote for kennedy but is the first to call my vote suspicious
[11:40:41] Ray: sam, why does my silence feel suspicious but dakota’s doesn’t
[11:40:57] Sam: i’m leaning towards ray because his silence and framing tactics feel too calculated
[11:41:02] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[11:41:26] Game-Manager: Ray voted for Sam
[11:41:28] Game-Manager: Sam voted for Ray
[11:41:36] Game-Manager: Dakota voted for Ray
