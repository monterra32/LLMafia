[11:36:01] Ray: morning everyone—any early suspicions
[11:36:23] Ray: hey sam, parker’s awfully quiet so far, doesn’t that seem suspicious
[11:36:32] Ray: i’m with parker—kennedy’s unusually quiet and might be laying low
[11:37:40] Ray: you only jumped in after dakota pressed you for details, parker
[11:39:57] Ray: sam’s lone vote for kennedy still strikes me as odd
[11:40:25] Ray: mafia probably killed kennedy to frame sam for defending her
[11:40:41] Ray: sam, why does my silence feel suspicious but dakota’s doesn’t
