## CONTENT: Absolutely—I’ve got it! Here’s my quick recap to make sure we’re on the same page:

• Roles: Each of us is secretly either Mafia or a Bystander.  
• Day phase: Everyone discusses suspicions and then votes to lynch one player.  
• Night phase: The Mafia covertly choose one Bystander to eliminate.  
• Win conditions:  
 – Mafia win if they ever equal or outnumber the remaining Bystanders.  
 – Bystanders win if they successfully vote out all Mafia.

I’m ready to dive in—let’s have some fun (and I’ll try to keep a low profile, promise 😉)!

Do you want to send a message to the group chat now, or do you prefer to wait for now and see what messages others will send? Remember to choose to send a message only if your contribution to the discussion in the current time will be meaningful enough. Don't overflow the discussion with your messages! Pay attention to the amount of messages with your name compared to the amount of messages with names of other players and let them have their turn too! Check the speaker name in the last few messages, and decide accordingly based on whether you talked too much. Reply only with `<send>` if you want to send a message now, or only with `<wait>` if you want to wait for now, based on your decision!

## CONTENT: Your name is Dakota.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [11:35:46].
The other players in the game are:
 Ray ( unknown ) 
 Parker ( unknown ) 
 Sam ( unknown ) 
 Kennedy ( unknown ) 
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
Ray ( unknown ) 
Parker ( unknown ) 
Sam ( unknown ) 
Kennedy ( unknown ) 
In your response to that is shown to the user (excluding your hidden scratchpad), you can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:
<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.

Add a very short message to the game's chat. Be specific and keep it relevant to the current situation, according to the last messages and the game's status. Your message should only be one short sentence! Don't add a message that you've already added (in the chat history)! It is very important that you don't repeat yourself! Match your style of message to the other player's message style, with more emphasis on more recent messages.
Don't add the time, the timestamp or the [timestamp] in your answer!

## CONTENT: Your name is Dakota.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander.

Add a very short message to the game's chat. Be specific and keep it relevant to the current situation, according to the last messages and the game's status. Your message should only be one short sentence! Don't add a message that you've already added (in the chat history)! It is very important that you don't repeat yourself! Match your style of message to the other player's message style, with more emphasis on more recent messages.

The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander.

## CONTENT: Your name is Dakota.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [11:35:46].

## CONTENT: Your name is Dakota.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [11:35:46].
The other players in the game are:
 Ray ( unknown ) 
 Parker ( bystander ) 
 Sam ( unknown )

[11:37:04] Dakota: kennedy, can you explain what’s suspicious about my enthusiasm
[11:37:07] Kennedy: sorry for being quiet—i just find parker’s sudden focus on me odd, any thoughts
[11:37:09] Parker: they’ve asked nothing but questions and haven’t proposed a single suspect, which feels suspicious

[11:38:15] Game-Manager: There is only one mafia member left, so no need for discussion - cutting straight to voting!
[11:38:03] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Kennedy

## CONTENT: Your name is Dakota.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [11:35:46].
The other players in the game are:
 Ray ( unknown ) 
 Parker ( bystander ) 
 Sam ( unknown ) 
 Kennedy ( bystander ) 
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
Ray ( unknown ) 
Sam ( unknown ) 
In your response to that is shown to the user (excluding your hidden scratchpad), you can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:
<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.

[11:40:21] Dakota: sam, are you leaning towards ray or me as the mafia

The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [11:35:46].
The other players in the game are:
 Ray ( unknown ) 
 Parker ( bystander )

<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[11:35:46] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[11:35:59] Dakota: hey everyone, excited to start hunting the mafia
[11:35:59] Sam: hey all, any early thoughts on who might be mafia
[11:36:01] Ray: morning everyone—any early suspicions
[11:36:03] Parker: morning everyone, any initial suspects
[11:36:10] Sam: hey everyone, let’s keep our eyes peeled for anyone acting suspicious
[11:36:11] Kennedy: hey everyone, any initial suspicions on who the mafia might be
[11:36:15] Parker: kennedy’s been awfully quiet—does that strike anyone else as odd
[11:36:23] Ray: hey sam, parker’s awfully quiet so far, doesn’t that seem suspicious
[11:36:32] Ray: i’m with parker—kennedy’s unusually quiet and might be laying low
[11:36:41] Kennedy: anyone else think dakota’s enthusiasm is a bit suspicious
[11:36:47] Dakota: yeah parker, what exactly about kennedy’s quietness seems off to you
[11:36:51] Parker: i’ve already spoken twice; what part of that seems quiet to you, ray
[11:37:04] Dakota: kennedy, can you explain what’s suspicious about my enthusiasm
[11:37:07] Kennedy: sorry for being quiet—i just find parker’s sudden focus on me odd, any thoughts
[11:37:09] Parker: they’ve asked nothing but questions and haven’t proposed a single suspect, which feels suspicious
[11:37:20] Kennedy: dakota, your rapid defense makes me wonder what you’re hiding
[11:37:30] Dakota: parker's defensive tone seems suspicious
[11:37:33] Sam: kennedy's silence feels more calculated than dakota's enthusiasm
[11:37:40] Ray: you only jumped in after dakota pressed you for details, parker
[11:37:46] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[11:38:15] Game-Manager: Parker was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 1 mafia players left.
[11:38:15] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[11:38:15] Game-Manager: There is only one mafia member left, so no need for discussion - cutting straight to voting!
[11:38:03] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Kennedy
[11:38:05] Game-Manager: Dakota voted for Parker
[11:38:07] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Parker
[11:38:12] Game-Manager: Ray voted for Parker
[11:38:15] Game-Manager: Sam voted for Kennedy
[11:39:02] Game-Manager: Kennedy was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 1 mafia players left.
[11:39:02] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[11:39:50] Dakota: dakota: any theories why the mafia picked off kennedy last night
[11:39:57] Ray: sam’s lone vote for kennedy still strikes me as odd
[11:40:08] Sam: with only one mafia left, ray’s silence feels suspicious
[11:40:21] Dakota: sam, are you leaning towards ray or me as the mafia
[11:40:25] Ray: mafia probably killed kennedy to frame sam for defending her
[11:40:34] Dakota: ray, you’ve been awfully silent today—what’s your read on who the remaining mafia might be
[11:40:34] Sam: odd that ray didn’t vote for kennedy but is the first to call my vote suspicious
[11:40:41] Ray: sam, why does my silence feel suspicious but dakota’s doesn’t
[11:40:57] Sam: i’m leaning towards ray because his silence and framing tactics feel too calculated
[11:41:02] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...

## CONTENT: Your name is Dakota.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [11:35:46].
The other players in the game are:
 Ray ( mafia ) 
 Parker ( bystander ) 
 Sam ( unknown ) 
 Kennedy ( bystander ) 
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
Sam ( unknown ) 
In your response to that is shown to the user (excluding your hidden scratchpad), you can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:
<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.
