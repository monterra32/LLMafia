[11:35:59] Sam: hey all, any early thoughts on who might be mafia
[11:36:10] Sam: hey everyone, let’s keep our eyes peeled for anyone acting suspicious
[11:37:33] Sam: kennedy's silence feels more calculated than dakota's enthusiasm
[11:40:08] Sam: with only one mafia left, ray’s silence feels suspicious
[11:40:34] Sam: odd that ray didn’t vote for kennedy but is the first to call my vote suspicious
[11:40:57] Sam: i’m leaning towards ray because his silence and framing tactics feel too calculated
