## CONTENT: You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. + 
 + Do you understand the rules? +

The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander.

The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.

The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander.

Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.

Add a very short message to the game's chat. Be specific and keep it relevant to the current situation, according to the last messages and the game's status. Your message should only be one short sentence! Don't add a message that you've already added (in the chat history)! It is very important that you don't repeat yourself! Match your style of message to the other player's message style, with more emphasis on more recent messages.

## CONTENT: Your name is Sam.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [11:35:46].
The other players in the game are:
 Ray ( unknown ) 
 Parker ( bystander )

[11:35:46] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[11:35:59] Dakota: hey everyone, excited to start hunting the mafia
[11:35:59] Sam: hey all, any early thoughts on who might be mafia
[11:36:01] Ray: morning everyone—any early suspicions
[11:36:03] Parker: morning everyone, any initial suspects
[11:36:10] Sam: hey everyone, let’s keep our eyes peeled for anyone acting suspicious
[11:36:11] Kennedy: hey everyone, any initial suspicions on who the mafia might be
[11:36:15] Parker: kennedy’s been awfully quiet—does that strike anyone else as odd
[11:36:23] Ray: hey sam, parker’s awfully quiet so far, doesn’t that seem suspicious
[11:36:32] Ray: i’m with parker—kennedy’s unusually quiet and might be laying low
[11:36:41] Kennedy: anyone else think dakota’s enthusiasm is a bit suspicious
[11:36:47] Dakota: yeah parker, what exactly about kennedy’s quietness seems off to you
[11:36:51] Parker: i’ve already spoken twice; what part of that seems quiet to you, ray
[11:37:04] Dakota: kennedy, can you explain what’s suspicious about my enthusiasm
[11:37:07] Kennedy: sorry for being quiet—i just find parker’s sudden focus on me odd, any thoughts
[11:37:09] Parker: they’ve asked nothing but questions and haven’t proposed a single suspect, which feels suspicious
[11:37:20] Kennedy: dakota, your rapid defense makes me wonder what you’re hiding
[11:37:30] Dakota: parker's defensive tone seems suspicious
[11:37:33] Sam: kennedy's silence feels more calculated than dakota's enthusiasm
[11:37:40] Ray: you only jumped in after dakota pressed you for details, parker
[11:37:46] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[11:38:15] Game-Manager: Parker was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 1 mafia players left.
[11:38:15] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[11:38:15] Game-Manager: There is only one mafia member left, so no need for discussion - cutting straight to voting!
[11:38:03] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Kennedy
[11:38:05] Game-Manager: Dakota voted for Parker
[11:38:07] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Parker
[11:38:12] Game-Manager: Ray voted for Parker
[11:38:15] Game-Manager: Sam voted for Kennedy
[11:39:02] Game-Manager: Kennedy was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 1 mafia players left.
[11:39:02] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[11:39:50] Dakota: dakota: any theories why the mafia picked off kennedy last night
[11:39:57] Ray: sam’s lone vote for kennedy still strikes me as odd
[11:40:08] Sam: with only one mafia left, ray’s silence feels suspicious
[11:40:21] Dakota: sam, are you leaning towards ray or me as the mafia
[11:40:25] Ray: mafia probably killed kennedy to frame sam for defending her
[11:40:34] Dakota: ray, you’ve been awfully silent today—what’s your read on who the remaining mafia might be
[11:40:34] Sam: odd that ray didn’t vote for kennedy but is the first to call my vote suspicious
[11:40:41] Ray: sam, why does my silence feel suspicious but dakota’s doesn’t

## CONTENT: Your name is Sam.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [11:35:46].
The other players in the game are:
 Ray ( unknown ) 
 Parker ( bystander ) 
 Kennedy ( bystander ) 
 Dakota ( unknown ) 
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:

## CONTENT: Your name is Sam.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [11:35:46].
The other players in the game are:

[11:35:46] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[11:35:59] Dakota: hey everyone, excited to start hunting the mafia
[11:35:59] Sam: hey all, any early thoughts on who might be mafia
[11:36:01] Ray: morning everyone—any early suspicions
[11:36:03] Parker: morning everyone, any initial suspects
[11:36:10] Sam: hey everyone, let’s keep our eyes peeled for anyone acting suspicious
[11:36:11] Kennedy: hey everyone, any initial suspicions on who the mafia might be
[11:36:15] Parker: kennedy’s been awfully quiet—does that strike anyone else as odd
[11:36:23] Ray: hey sam, parker’s awfully quiet so far, doesn’t that seem suspicious
[11:36:32] Ray: i’m with parker—kennedy’s unusually quiet and might be laying low
[11:36:41] Kennedy: anyone else think dakota’s enthusiasm is a bit suspicious
[11:36:47] Dakota: yeah parker, what exactly about kennedy’s quietness seems off to you
[11:36:51] Parker: i’ve already spoken twice; what part of that seems quiet to you, ray
[11:37:04] Dakota: kennedy, can you explain what’s suspicious about my enthusiasm
[11:37:07] Kennedy: sorry for being quiet—i just find parker’s sudden focus on me odd, any thoughts
[11:37:09] Parker: they’ve asked nothing but questions and haven’t proposed a single suspect, which feels suspicious
[11:37:20] Kennedy: dakota, your rapid defense makes me wonder what you’re hiding
[11:37:30] Dakota: parker's defensive tone seems suspicious
[11:37:33] Sam: kennedy's silence feels more calculated than dakota's enthusiasm
[11:37:40] Ray: you only jumped in after dakota pressed you for details, parker
[11:37:46] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[11:38:15] Game-Manager: Parker was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 1 mafia players left.
[11:38:15] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[11:38:15] Game-Manager: There is only one mafia member left, so no need for discussion - cutting straight to voting!
[11:38:03] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Kennedy
[11:38:05] Game-Manager: Dakota voted for Parker
[11:38:07] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Parker

[11:39:57] Ray: sam’s lone vote for kennedy still strikes me as odd
[11:40:08] Sam: with only one mafia left, ray’s silence feels suspicious
[11:40:21] Dakota: sam, are you leaning towards ray or me as the mafia
[11:40:25] Ray: mafia probably killed kennedy to frame sam for defending her
[11:40:34] Dakota: ray, you’ve been awfully silent today—what’s your read on who the remaining mafia might be
[11:40:34] Sam: odd that ray didn’t vote for kennedy but is the first to call my vote suspicious
