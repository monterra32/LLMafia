[11:02:29] Kennedy: hey everyone! kennedy here. since we’re all quiet, let’s break the ice with quick intros and any gut hunches—purely speculative, no vote pressure yet. i’ll start: i’m kennedy, and i don’t have a strong read so far, but i’ll be watching for anyone steering the conversation too forcefully. who wants to go next
[11:02:49] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! tough day 1 for gut reads. i’m seeing a couple flags on parker’s silence—could be legit, or just bandwagoning. adrian, that early callout was bold—what exactly in parker’s quiet stood out for you? sidney and finley, do you think there’s more in how folks are jumping in or holding back? and drew or tyler—since you’re both watching patterns, any slips or tells you’ve noticed? would love more detail before we lock in a vote
[11:03:17] Kennedy: hey all, kennedy here—i’m not convinced parker’s day-1 silence is a mafia tell (could just be nerves), but i am curious about adrian’s eagerness to call them out. i’m tentatively casting a soft vote on adrian to see how everyone reacts (totally open to switching). parker, can you expand on why you think adrian’s move feels like deflection? and drew, tyler, finley, sidney—what do you make of a test vote on adrian right now
[11:03:39] Kennedy: kennedy: i’m holding off on my vote—feels early to lock onto parker without more concrete reasons. adrian, can you specify what about parker’s silence struck you as suspicious rather than just day 1 nerves? and parker, since you’ve been doing some pattern reading, who else are you keeping an eye on and why? let’s get some real details before we decide
[11:04:05] Kennedy: kennedy: hey everyone, to spread the focus i’m also watching adrian—he was first to target parker before we’d even heard more. i’m tentatively soft-voting adrian to see how he reacts. adrian, what tipped you off so early? drew, tyler, sidney, finley—who’s your second gut hunch and why? let’s compare notes
[11:04:39] Kennedy: i’m tossing my second soft vote onto tyler—he was quick to pin “lurking” on drew without any concrete read. 

tyler, what specific phrasing from drew made you zero in on him rather than someone like sidney or parker? drew, does tyler’s early vote feel like real suspicion or just another test? 

sidney, finley, adrian—who’s your next name and what detail are you watching? let’s get those specifics on the table
[11:05:13] Kennedy: hey everyone, let’s push this to a decision. parker, can you cast a soft vote on either adrian or drew so we see you’re genuinely weighing another suspect? if you can’t, i’ll convert my soft vote on you into a firm one. everyone else, if you don’t have a detailed read on someone besides parker, please lock in your vote on parker so we can wrap up day 1. and if you do have solid reasons to watch adrian, drew or tyler, share them now with specifics. let’s get clarity before we lose momentum
[11:05:34] Kennedy: kennedy: hey team, quick tally—we’ve got 3 soft votes on parker, 2 on adrian, 1 on drew and 1 on tyler. before we lock anything in, let’s nail down some specifics. tyler, you flagged drew’s “lurking on votes” line—can you quote the exact phrase and explain why that reads mafia-like instead of cautious bystander behavior? finley, you’re backing parker for day-1 silence—what precise wording or pause set off your alarm bells? and parker, if you’re genuinely undecided, toss a soft vote on someone else (say sidney or drew) and walk us through why. let’s get those quotes and reasoning in now so we can move to a final vote
[11:11:17] Kennedy: hey everyone—day 2 is here, and losing parker then adrian hurts. with two mafia still in our midst, i want to pull from yesterday’s vote data: parker drew five votes vs. drew’s two. notice parker’s last‐second flip onto drew picked up tyler’s vote—if parker’s town, that actually makes tyler look towny too. that suggests we should scrutinize who drove the parker bandwagon hardest: finley and sidney.  

finley, can you quote the exact line in parker’s early posts that set off alarm bells for you? sidney, what detail in their silence felt more mafia-ish than typical day-1 nerves? drew—where are you leaning today after watching all that unfold? tyler, does this analysis hold up on your end, or am i missing something? let’s get those specific reads on the table before we start voting
[11:11:51] Kennedy: kennedy: i’m also tossing a soft vote on tyler—like finley said, his late pivot to drew felt more like splitting the table than a genuine read. he wrote “i’m going to tentatively put my soft vote on drew” pointing only to drew’s “lurking on early votes,” but offered no concrete detail beyond that. that vague nudge struck me as deflective. drew, sidney—who are you each watching right now, and what exact line or action tipped you off
[11:12:48] Kennedy: kennedy: hey everyone—before we lock in our votes, let’s get a bit of clarity on these reads.  
• sidney, you just cast a vote for adrian even though he’s been eliminated—town players usually track who’s in. can you explain that?  
• finley, you flagged tyler for “splitting the table” on day 1—what exact line or phrasing from tyler read mafia-style to you?  
• drew, you said my earlier comment was “corralling votes”—which snippet felt manipulative rather than helpful?  

i’m shifting a soft vote onto sidney to see how she responds—if it was just a typo, i’ll switch my vote. everyone else, drop your top day 2 suspect with the exact quote or move that tipped you off, then we’ll cast final votes
[11:13:37] Kennedy: kennedy: i’m locking in my vote on tyler. his line “i’m going to soft-vote you to see how you defend it” felt like a probe rather than a real read, and his follow-up about the night kill being a “silencing of our loudest skeptic” is just broad narrative with zero quotes. that pattern of vague testing strikes me as mafia. drew—are you ready to join on tyler? sidney, finley—any last thoughts before we seal this
