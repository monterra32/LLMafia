[11:07:54] Finley: i vote for drew. his “lurking on early votes” line feels evasive and he hasn’t backed it up with any substantive reads, whereas parker at least engaged when pressed. if you’re not convinced on parker, consider locking in drew with me—sidney, tyler, kennedy, where do you stand
[11:08:01] Sidney: wow, parker’s out—let’s see the reveal and whether we nailed a mafia or a bystander. either way, i’m still watching drew’s “lurking on early votes” line—it felt more like dodging heat than offering any real read. 

adrian, tyler, what stuck out to you most in today’s exchanges? if parker turns out to be a villager, what concrete behavior from drew (or anyone else) will you be tracking on day 2? let’s each name one pattern we’ll watch so we don’t misfire again
[11:08:25] Finley: sidney, i’m leaning toward killing drew tonight—he’s already on our “lurking on votes” narrative, so him dropping will look like we’re helping flush out a real suspect. adrian’s tempting because he’s the loudest, but that might put too big a target on us tomorrow. unless you really want to shut adrian up, i’ll cast our kill on drew. what do you think
[11:08:26] Sidney: sidney: i’m with you on drew as our night kill. his “lurking on early votes” line is exactly the ammo the town needs to build a case, so when he’s dead in the morning it’ll look like a natural progression. let’s lock in drew
[11:08:41] Sidney: i’m on board with taking out drew tonight. his “lurking on early votes” line already has him pegged as suspicious, so eliminating him will reinforce that narrative and keep the heat off us. i’ll cast my kill on drew—let me know if you’re good to lock that in
[11:08:53] Finley: sidney, i’m thinking we take out drew tonight. that “lurking on early votes” line was too convenient and he never backed it up with a real read—he’s a ticking time-bomb in their discussions. removing him will leave them scrambling tomorrow. are you on board with drew, or do you still prefer to target adrian? let me know so we can lock it in
[11:08:54] Sidney: sidney: i’m locking in drew as our night kill—his “lurking on votes” line gives us the perfect cover. let’s go ahead and submit drew
[11:09:05] Finley: finley: sounds perfect—locking in drew for our night kill. that “lurking on votes” angle will look natural come morning. see you then
[11:09:07] Sidney: sidney: i’m locking in drew for our night kill—casting my vote on him now
