[11:02:16] Adrian: hey everyone, adrian here! excited to get day 1 rolling. since nobody’s spoken yet, i’m already a bit suspicious of parker—silence can be telling on day 1. no hard evidence though. who wants to go next and share any gut feelings or odd vibes you’ve picked up so far
[11:02:17] Drew: hey everyone, drew here! quiet start on day 1—hard to pull any reads with no chatter yet. what are your initial gut feelings? i’ll be lurking on how everyone votes early on, but i’d love to hear any first impressions
[11:02:21] Tyler: hey everyone, tyler here! super excited to get started. day 1 and we don’t have much to go on yet, so let’s share our gut instincts—anyone already feeling dodgy about someone? i’ll hang back and listen, but i’m eager to hear your first impressions before we cast any votes
[11:02:23] Finley: hey everyone, finley here! excited to get started. since it’s day 1 and we’ve got zero info, how about we each share our first impression or any gut feeling? i’ll kick things off: i don’t have a strong read yet, but parker’s been awfully quiet so far—could be nothing. what about the rest of you
[11:02:24] Sidney: hey everyone! excited to get started. no one’s spoken yet, which makes it tough to pick a suspect, but often the first person who jumps in might be trying to steer the conversation—or total silence could be just as telling. what do you all think? any early gut feelings
[11:02:25] Parker: hey everyone, parker here—excited to get started! since it’s day 1 we don’t have any hard clues yet, so i’ll be listening more than leading off with wild accusations. but i do tend to notice patterns—who’s too quiet, who’s overly eager to point fingers. what are your gut feelings so far? any initial strategy ideas before we dive in
[11:02:29] Kennedy: hey everyone! kennedy here. since we’re all quiet, let’s break the ice with quick intros and any gut hunches—purely speculative, no vote pressure yet. i’ll start: i’m kennedy, and i don’t have a strong read so far, but i’ll be watching for anyone steering the conversation too forcefully. who wants to go next
[11:02:36] Adrian: hey everyone, adrian here! we’re on day 1 with no clues yet—so how about a quick icebreaker? let’s each name one person we’d vote for right now (even if it’s just a gut feel). it’ll help us spot who jumps on bandwagons or shifts around later. who wants to kick us off
[11:02:38] Drew: hey everyone, drew here. parker’s early silence could just be nerves, so i’m not ready to call them out yet. i’d rather see who’s quick to pile on adrian’s point—sometimes the loudest support can be just as telling as the initial accusation. kennedy, how are you reading this? and finley, any early gut feelings on where to look first
[11:02:41] Tyler: tyler: hey everyone, tyler here! i agree it’s early for hard reads, but parker’s radio silence does stand out. of course it could just be nerves, so i’m not ready to lock in on anyone yet. kennedy, sidney, finley—what are your gut feels so far? even a quick reaction might help us decide if we want to put a soft vote on someone to test the waters
[11:02:41] Parker: hey everyone—i was quiet because i was reading through everyone’s intros, not because i’m hiding something. finley and adrian both flagged my silence, but honestly none of us had anything solid to go on until now. finley, adrian—what about my being quiet strikes you more mafia than just a cautious bystander?

also, i noticed drew said they’d be “lurking on early votes.” smart bystander move, or a mafia wanting to avoid the spotlight? since we need to get the ball rolling, maybe we start with someone who was eager to point fingers—adrian, you jumped right on me. thoughts on kicking off with adrian? or does anyone else feel someone else deserves our first look?
[11:02:44] Sidney: sidney here! i’m also noticing parker’s radio silence—and in a group this size, that really stands out. i’m hesitant to lynch purely on that, but i’d like to put a tentative vote on parker to see if we can get them to speak up a bit. unless someone has a stronger read, i’ll stick with parker for now. thoughts
[11:02:45] Finley: hey everyone, finley here—super excited for day 1! it’s really early, but i’ve noticed parker hasn’t said much yet—could be just easing in or maybe a stealth move. and adrian was pretty quick to flag parker off the bat—could be a genuine read or a classic deflection. parker, what are your thoughts so far? i’d also love to hear initial hunches from kennedy and sidney before we start casting any votes. anyone else picking up on anything odd
[11:02:49] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! tough day 1 for gut reads. i’m seeing a couple flags on parker’s silence—could be legit, or just bandwagoning. adrian, that early callout was bold—what exactly in parker’s quiet stood out for you? sidney and finley, do you think there’s more in how folks are jumping in or holding back? and drew or tyler—since you’re both watching patterns, any slips or tells you’ve noticed? would love more detail before we lock in a vote
[11:02:59] Drew: drew: i’ll toss in a tentative vote for parker—silence on day 1 feels odd to me, though i’m perfectly happy to switch if someone else makes a better case. who’s next
[11:03:02] Parker: alright, i’ll toss in a soft vote for adrian—he was quick to single me out and seems keen to spark a bandwagon. no solid evidence, just a gut-check. who else is up for naming a soft vote right now? keen to see if any names start to cluster or if we’re all over the map
[11:03:08] Finley: i’m on board with a tentative vote on parker—silence this long, plus that quick deflection onto adrian, is enough to warrant a little test. i’ll throw my vote there too, just to see how parker reacts.

parker, if you really were just catching up on intros, what would you do in the next minute to prove you’re not hiding something? and adrian—what about parker stood out so strongly for you right off the bat, rather than letting everyone get a word in? let’s see how they respond before we lock anything in
[11:03:11] Tyler: i’m not totally sold on anyone yet, but if i have to cast a vote, i’ll tentatively put it on parker—his radio silence is standing out on day 1. parker, what’s your take on all this? any gut read or strategy you can share to put our minds at ease
[11:03:16] Drew: i’m going to hold off on voting for now—day 1 nerves can look a lot like mafia stealth. parker’s quiet start is worth noting, but i’d like more than radio silence. adrian, you were first to flag parker—what about that initial silence feels mafia-ish rather than just cautious? and kennedy (or finley), do you see any patterns in how folks are piling on or pushing back that seem more telling? let’s flesh that out before we lock in a vote
[11:03:17] Kennedy: hey all, kennedy here—i’m not convinced parker’s day-1 silence is a mafia tell (could just be nerves), but i am curious about adrian’s eagerness to call them out. i’m tentatively casting a soft vote on adrian to see how everyone reacts (totally open to switching). parker, can you expand on why you think adrian’s move feels like deflection? and drew, tyler, finley, sidney—what do you make of a test vote on adrian right now
[11:03:18] Sidney: sidney: jumping in on adrian’s icebreaker, i’m tentatively voting parker. their initial silence and quick defensiveness when we called it out feels off for day 1. that said, i’m open-minded—drew, kennedy, tyler, finley, who’s your gut vote right now
[11:03:22] Parker: hey all, i get why my silence stood out—i was just taking in everyone’s intros, not cooking up a mafia scheme. to help us move off the parker train, can we dig into specifics and spread the focus? 

adrian—what about my quiet felt more suspicious than just a cautious bystander? drew, tyler, sidney—who else have you noticed acting odd or steering conversation? and maybe we each throw out one more name we’re watching (no hard votes yet), so we can compare patterns. i’ll kick us off: i’m curious about adrian’s eagerness to call out someone with zero reads—what’s your take on that?
[11:03:25] Adrian: kennedy, you asked why parker’s silence felt off—that’s my read too: day 1 bystanders usually at least pop in with a guess, but parker stayed completely quiet until we called them out, then flipped straight onto me, which feels a bit defensive in a way i’d expect from mafia. 

parker, if you really are just sizing everyone up, can you throw out a tentative gut vote? even a random guess shows whether you’re genuinely unsure or trying to steer. 

drew, tyler—anything about parker’s tone or choice of words that jumped out to you? 

and to everyone else, who’s got a quick gut hunch on someone besides parker? let’s get a few more angles before we lock in any votes
[11:03:38] Tyler: tyler: i’ll tentatively soft-vote parker for now—day 1 silence plus that quick deflection feels off. parker, before i lock this in, can you point to one specific detail you noticed in someone else’s post (maybe something sidney or finley said) that caught your eye? a concrete read from you will help me decide—otherwise i’ll cast my vote soon
[11:03:39] Finley: i’ll toss in a soft vote for parker—day 1 silence still feels like a red flag. parker, what made you switch gears and point at adrian instead of sticking with your own quiet read? adrian, what exactly about parker’s silence set off alarms for you so early? and tyler or kennedy, any gut impressions on either before we lock in
[11:03:39] Kennedy: kennedy: i’m holding off on my vote—feels early to lock onto parker without more concrete reasons. adrian, can you specify what about parker’s silence struck you as suspicious rather than just day 1 nerves? and parker, since you’ve been doing some pattern reading, who else are you keeping an eye on and why? let’s get some real details before we decide
[11:03:42] Sidney: sidney: interesting pivot to adrian, kennedy—but i’m still hung up on parker. radio silence for the first half-minute, then a quick deflection onto adrian feels dodgey. adrian at least gave reasons for flagging parker’s quiet; parker’s rebuttal just shifts blame without addressing that silence. i’m keeping my soft vote on parker—parker, what exactly makes adrian more suspect than your own no-show? anyone else still sticking with parker over adrian
[11:03:47] Adrian: adrian: hey folks! quick clarification on why parker’s on my radar—it’s not just the day-1 silence, it’s pairing that with an almost instant pivot to accuse me instead of sharing any reads of your own. if you were just catching up, i’d expect something like “sorry, was reading through intros—i’m actually watching sidney because xyz.” so for now i’m keeping a soft vote on you.

but i don’t want to be the only one in the hot seat, so i’m also eyeballing tyler—lots of “i’m listening” but zero concrete hunches yet. tyler, who’s your gut suspect right now and what tipped you that way? and parker, care to drop another name you’re watching besides me? let’s spread the focus and see who really steps up with details
[11:04:05] Kennedy: kennedy: hey everyone, to spread the focus i’m also watching adrian—he was first to target parker before we’d even heard more. i’m tentatively soft-voting adrian to see how he reacts. adrian, what tipped you off so early? drew, tyler, sidney, finley—who’s your second gut hunch and why? let’s compare notes
[11:04:06] Adrian: alright, let’s get some more angles before we lock onto parker. 

parker—if you’re genuinely unsure, throw a soft vote on someone else (say drew or tyler) so we can see if you’re reading the table or just dodging. 

drew, you’ve been “lurking on votes” so what’s your tentative gut pick right now? 

sidney, finley, tyler—any other names you’re quietly watching? if we get a second suspect, we’ll see whether votes cluster or parker keeps deflecting. then we can decide if parker deserves our day-1 test
[11:04:08] Tyler: tyler: i’m going to tentatively put my soft vote on drew—his “lurking” comment felt more deflective than constructive. drew, who else besides parker is on your radar? and sidney, finley, kennedy, adrian—what’s one other name you’re watching right now? let’s list a few and see where we land
[11:04:15] Drew: drew: okay, a couple thoughts—adrian, i hear you on that reflexive deflection from parker, it did come off defensive. parker, thanks for tossing a vote on adrian—it helps balance things out. beyond parker, i’m also watching sidney’s quick jump to a tentative vote. sidney, what about parker’s silence stood out to you over someone like finley or tyler, who’d also been quiet? kennedy, tyler, finley—who’s your second gut pick right now? let’s each drop one more name and see if any patterns pop before we lock anything in
[11:04:15] Parker: hey everyone—thanks for the questions. here’s what i’d do next to prove i’m not hiding anything:

1) i’ll lay out my full read so far, not just on myself but on others: adrian jumped in first accusing me with zero evidence, then pushed for an immediate vote—that feels like a classic deflection play rather than a genuine bystander move.  
2) i want adrian to clarify exactly what in my brief silence screamed “mafia” more than his eagerness to rally votes.  
3) i’m soft-voting adrian right now to see how he handles that—if he can explain his read in detail, i’ll drop it. if he rambles or ducks specifics, we’ll have a clearer picture.  

kennedy, does that match what you’re seeing in adrian’s play? finley, tyler, drew, sidney—what do you think of using this test vote to flush out adrian’s defense? if you’re uneasy, feel free to add or move your soft vote and let’s watch how he reacts
[11:04:18] Sidney: sidney: you know what, i’m not convinced by parker’s silence alone—it’s too early to lynch on vibes. i’m going to shift my soft vote over to adrian as a test. adrian, you were the first to flag parker—can you quote the exact line in their intro that made you so sure? parker, what about adrian’s opening felt like a deflection rather than a genuine read? drew, tyler, kennedy, finley—anyone want to join a soft vote on adrian to see how he reacts? let’s spread these test votes and get some real answers before we lock anyone in
[11:04:25] Tyler: tyler: i’m going to soft-vote drew for now—he’s been talking about “lurking on votes” but hasn’t offered any concrete reads, and i want to see how he reacts. parker, can you throw a soft-vote on someone besides adrian (say drew or sidney) so we know you’re actually sizing up the table? drew, if you’ve got another name you’re quietly watching, now’s the time to share it. sidney, finley—any second suspects on your radars? let’s see whether these test votes cluster before we commit
[11:04:28] Drew: hey everyone—i see tyler’s soft vote on me for “lurking,” but i’m genuinely trying to parse reads, not dodge. my main soft vote stays on parker for that day-1 silence. for a second suspect i’m eyeing adrian—that early, confident nudge on parker then swift deflection felt a bit too sharp for a casual bystander move. adrian, can you flesh out exactly what in parker’s tone or wording set off alarms for you? and sidney, finley, kennedy, tyler—what’s your secondary hunch? let’s list those so we can see where patterns overlap before we lock anything in
[11:04:31] Adrian: okay, our soft votes on parker are at four now, and i’ve got two on me—so that’s a pretty clear lead on parker. 

parker, you’ve had plenty of time to weigh in: name one other person in this room you’re watching right now and why. 

tyler, you’ve been “listening” but haven’t given us a single hunch—who would you place a soft vote on and what detail tipped you? 

drew and sidney, you both tentatively backed parker—are you ready to lock that in, or do you need more from them (or from tyler) before we call this vote? let’s get some real reads on the table
[11:04:35] Parker: parker: hey all, thanks for the insights. i’m still soft-voting adrian—his lightning-fast call felt more like deflection than a genuine read. for a second watch, i’ve got sidney—she jumped on my silence but hasn’t pointed to any detail beyond “quiet.” sidney, can you pinpoint what in my wording or tone read mafia-ish rather than typical day-one nerves? and tyler, drew, finley, kennedy—what’s your second gut hunch, and what specific detail in their play made you suspicious? let’s see if any real patterns emerge before we lock anything in
[11:04:37] Finley: i’m still leaning on parker—day-1 radio silence plus that quick deflection keeps feeling off. right now our soft votes are spread three on parker, one on adrian and one on drew. unless someone can give me a solid detail on adrian or drew that beats parker’s silence, i say we lock in parker. 

parker—before we finalize, toss a soft vote on either adrian or drew so we see if you’re genuinely undecided. and drew—can you pinpoint exactly what about “lurking on votes” reads mafia-style rather than just cautious bystander behavior? let’s get those specifics and then put a pin in this
[11:04:39] Kennedy: i’m tossing my second soft vote onto tyler—he was quick to pin “lurking” on drew without any concrete read. 

tyler, what specific phrasing from drew made you zero in on him rather than someone like sidney or parker? drew, does tyler’s early vote feel like real suspicion or just another test? 

sidney, finley, adrian—who’s your next name and what detail are you watching? let’s get those specifics on the table
[11:04:55] Adrian: okay, let me lay out exactly what set off my radar and propose a way forward:

parker, your very first post said you’d “be listening more than leading wild accusations,” yet the moment our group noted your silence you immediately shot back with “maybe we start with someone eager to point fingers—adrian, thoughts on kicking off with adrian?” that flip from neutral observer to quick accuser—without offering any own reads—feels like a classic deflection play rather than genuine day-1 caution.

if you really are just sizing everyone up, throw a soft vote on someone else (sidney or drew, for example) and explain why you’re watching them. that’ll show you’re actually reading the table instead of dodging.

as for me, besides parker i’m also keeping an eye on tyler—lots of “i’m listening” but no concrete hunch yet. drew, are you still leaning on parker or is your second suspect more compelling? tyler, finley, kenn­edy, sidney—who’s your #2 gut pick and what tipped you? let’s spread those soft votes around and see which names truly start to stick before we commit
[11:04:57] Sidney: sidney: i’m on board with testing parker here. parker, you’ve had enough time to observe the table—what exactly jumped out at you in someone else’s post? quote a phrase or point to a detail in tyler’s, finley’s, or kennedy’s comment that felt off. if you can’t, your radio silence plus that quick flip on adrian looks like a dodge. i’ll keep my soft vote on you until we see something concrete. drew, tyler, kennedy, finley—does that seem fair
[11:05:13] Kennedy: hey everyone, let’s push this to a decision. parker, can you cast a soft vote on either adrian or drew so we see you’re genuinely weighing another suspect? if you can’t, i’ll convert my soft vote on you into a firm one. everyone else, if you don’t have a detailed read on someone besides parker, please lock in your vote on parker so we can wrap up day 1. and if you do have solid reasons to watch adrian, drew or tyler, share them now with specifics. let’s get clarity before we lose momentum
[11:05:16] Finley: i’m shifting my soft vote over to adrian as a test. adrian, can you quote the exact phrase in parker’s intro that you found mafia-ish rather than just day-one nerves? and i’m dropping a second soft vote on tyler—tyler, you’ve been “listening” but haven’t offered any concrete reads. if you’ve got a gut feeling on someone, now’s the time to share it. let’s flush out some real reasons before we lock anything in
[11:05:17] Parker: hey everyone—thanks for bearing with my pivots. here’s who else i’m watching besides adrian: drew. that “lurking on early votes” line felt more like a deflection than a real read. drew—can you point to one specific post (maybe from sidney or tyler) that genuinely raised your suspicions? adrian—can you quote the exact sentence in my first post that screamed “mafia” to you? if neither of you can back up your reads with concrete quotes, we don’t have a strong case. sidney, finley, kennedy, tyler—what’s your gut on drew vs. adrian right now? let’s get some real details before we lock anyone in
[11:05:21] Drew: i’m still holding my primary soft-vote on parker—day-1 silence plus that instant deflection felt off—and my secondary on adrian for jumping in so confidently without solid reads. 

adrian, can you quote the exact phrasing in parker’s intro that screamed “mafia” to you? tyler, what about my “lurking on votes” comment read mafia-style rather than cautious bystander behavior? 

if we don’t get a stronger, specific case against someone else in the next minute, i say we lock in parker and force a defense—let’s see real details before we move on
[11:05:27] Tyler: tyler: okay everyone, our soft votes are all over the map—parker, adrian, drew and even me have tokens. before we lock anything in, let’s each back up our top pick with an exact quote:

• i’ll go first: drew’s line “i’ll be lurking on early votes” read to me like dodging responsibility rather than observing—that’s why i’m on drew.  
• adrian, what exact phrasing in parker’s intro set off your alarm bells?  
• parker, which precise words of adrian’s first call felt like a deflection?  
• sidney or finley or kennedy, pick your main suspect and drop the quote that sold you.

once we’ve got those specifics, we each cast one final vote and see where the real patterns lie
[11:05:31] Parker: i’m shifting my soft vote onto drew. drew, in your very first post you said you’d be “lurking on how everyone votes early on”—that reads more like a stealth move than a bystander sharing a read. can you clarify exactly what you meant by “lurking” and how that helps us narrow down suspects?  

finley, you just dropped a soft vote on tyler—what specific wording or behavior from tyler made you lean on him? adrian and kennedy, does moving a soft vote onto drew sit right with you, or do you still feel parker belongs on the chopping block today? let’s get these concrete reads before locking anything in
[11:05:31] Sidney: okay everyone, we’re down to the wire. i’m ready to lock in parker—day-one silence and that quick pivot to accuse me still feels dodgey. parker, if you genuinely have a read on someone else, toss a soft vote their way now; otherwise i’ll cast my vote on you. drew, tyler, kennedy, finley—any final reads or pivots before we seal this
[11:05:33] Finley: i’m moving my soft vote on parker to a firm vote—day 1 radio silence plus that instant flip onto adrian is all we’ve got from you, parker. if you really have a gut read on someone else (say adrian, drew or tyler), please soft-vote them now and share the specific detail that tipped you off. otherwise i’ll count you in with parker. and if anyone here has concrete reasons to watch adrian, drew or tyler, speak up now—if not, let’s lock in parker and keep this rolling
[11:05:34] Kennedy: kennedy: hey team, quick tally—we’ve got 3 soft votes on parker, 2 on adrian, 1 on drew and 1 on tyler. before we lock anything in, let’s nail down some specifics. tyler, you flagged drew’s “lurking on votes” line—can you quote the exact phrase and explain why that reads mafia-like instead of cautious bystander behavior? finley, you’re backing parker for day-1 silence—what precise wording or pause set off your alarm bells? and parker, if you’re genuinely undecided, toss a soft vote on someone else (say sidney or drew) and walk us through why. let’s get those quotes and reasoning in now so we can move to a final vote
[11:05:35] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[11:05:45] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Drew
[11:05:50] Game-Manager: Drew voted for Parker
[11:05:59] Game-Manager: Adrian voted for Parker
[11:06:11] Game-Manager: Finley voted for Parker
[11:06:19] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Parker
[11:06:46] Game-Manager: Tyler voted for Drew
[11:07:17] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Parker
[11:11:17] Finley: adrian got killed overnight—no surprise given how vocal he was yesterday. with five left (two mafia, three bystanders), we need strong reads. i’m throwing a soft vote on tyler—that late vote on drew felt like splitting the table instead of a real suspicion. drew, kennedy, sidney—who are you suspecting right now, and what exact line or action tipped you off? let’s get those specifics in before we lock anything down
[11:11:17] Kennedy: hey everyone—day 2 is here, and losing parker then adrian hurts. with two mafia still in our midst, i want to pull from yesterday’s vote data: parker drew five votes vs. drew’s two. notice parker’s last‐second flip onto drew picked up tyler’s vote—if parker’s town, that actually makes tyler look towny too. that suggests we should scrutinize who drove the parker bandwagon hardest: finley and sidney.  

finley, can you quote the exact line in parker’s early posts that set off alarm bells for you? sidney, what detail in their silence felt more mafia-ish than typical day-1 nerves? drew—where are you leaning today after watching all that unfold? tyler, does this analysis hold up on your end, or am i missing something? let’s get those specific reads on the table before we start voting
[11:11:18] Sidney: sidney: i’m voting for adrian—he jumped on the parker lynch first thing without quoting a single line from my intro and then went quiet. adrian, can you point to the exact phrasing in my first post that convinced you i was suspicious? if not, i’ll stick with this vote
[11:11:22] Drew: drew: rough losing parker and then adrian last night—our mafia aren’t shy about taking out vocal bystanders. for day 2 let’s sharpen our reads: everyone name one suspect and quote the exact line or move that set off alarm bells. i’ll start: i’m soft-voting kennedy—her “if you can’t back up your reads, i’ll count you in” felt like corralling votes rather than offering her own analysis. sidney, tyler, finley—who’s your day 2 pick and what quote stuck out to you
[11:11:51] Tyler: hey everyone, tough losses so far—parker was an innocent catch and now we lost adrian at night. that night kill tells me the mafia wanted to silence our loudest skeptic. looking back, sidney, you jumped on parker with “i’m hesitant to lynch purely on that, but i’d like to put a tentative vote on parker to see if they speak up.” can you point to the exact wording in parker’s post that read mafia-ish rather than just quiet nerves? i’m going to soft-vote you to see how you defend it. 

drew, finley, kennedy—who’s your day 2 target and what exact quote or behavior tipped you off? let’s back every suspicion with specifics before we lock in
[11:11:51] Kennedy: kennedy: i’m also tossing a soft vote on tyler—like finley said, his late pivot to drew felt more like splitting the table than a genuine read. he wrote “i’m going to tentatively put my soft vote on drew” pointing only to drew’s “lurking on early votes,” but offered no concrete detail beyond that. that vague nudge struck me as deflective. drew, sidney—who are you each watching right now, and what exact line or action tipped you off
[11:12:01] Sidney: i’m throwing a soft vote on tyler—that late jump on drew felt more like bandwagoning than a genuine read. tyler, can you quote the exact line in drew’s posts that made you zero in on him? and kennedy, you flagged finley and me for driving the parker vote—what specific phrase in my day-1 comments read mafia-ish to you? drew, where are you leaning after watching all this? let’s get those quotes on the table before we lock anything in
[11:12:06] Finley: morning all—tough wake-up after adrian’s gone. let’s get sharper for day 2: each of us pick one line or moment from yesterday that rang alarm bells and say who it points to now. i’ll kick us off: drew’s “i’ll be lurking on how everyone votes early on” felt evasive, so he’s on my radar. who’s next
[11:12:16] Drew: drew: five of us left and the suspicion scatter is too wide. i’m throwing a soft vote on tyler for now—that late vote on me felt more like splitting the table than a real read. finley, can you quote the exact line from tyler’s post that tipped you off? sidney, you just voted for adrian—he’s out, so did you mean tyler? kennedy, you flagged me and finley yesterday—what specific phrasing are you quoting? let’s get those exact quotes on the table before we lock anything in
[11:12:36] Tyler: tyler: i’m putting a soft vote on finley. in your last post you said “that late vote on drew felt like splitting the table instead of a real suspicion.” that reads to me as a weak push to flush reactions, not a genuine read—there’s no quote of what in my drew vote looked like “splitting.” finley, can you point to the exact phrase in my drew vote that struck you as manipulative rather than honest? drew, sidney, kennedy—does finley’s tactic here feel like a mafia probe to you, or am i missing something
[11:12:48] Kennedy: kennedy: hey everyone—before we lock in our votes, let’s get a bit of clarity on these reads.  
• sidney, you just cast a vote for adrian even though he’s been eliminated—town players usually track who’s in. can you explain that?  
• finley, you flagged tyler for “splitting the table” on day 1—what exact line or phrasing from tyler read mafia-style to you?  
• drew, you said my earlier comment was “corralling votes”—which snippet felt manipulative rather than helpful?  

i’m shifting a soft vote onto sidney to see how she responds—if it was just a typo, i’ll switch my vote. everyone else, drop your top day 2 suspect with the exact quote or move that tipped you off, then we’ll cast final votes
[11:12:48] Sidney: i’m casting my vote on tyler. here’s the exact line that stuck out: tyler wrote “i’m going to soft-vote you to see how you defend it.” that feels like a probe more than a real read—classic mafia bait to flush out reactions.  

tyler, if you truly suspect someone, point to a specific quote or behavior that set you off. otherwise this just reads as a test play.  

drew, does a soft-vote test like that strike you as town-like or deflective? finley, kennedy—anything else in tyler’s wording that seals the deal for you? let’s get those specifics and lock this in
[11:12:54] Finley: finley: i vote for tyler. his line “that night kill tells me the mafia wanted to silence our loudest skeptic” felt like a narrative shove rather than genuine analysis, and he still hasn’t backed it up with any specific quotes from anyone else. let’s lock in tyler now. drew, kennedy—are you in
