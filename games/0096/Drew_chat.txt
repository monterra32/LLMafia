[11:02:17] Drew: hey everyone, drew here! quiet start on day 1—hard to pull any reads with no chatter yet. what are your initial gut feelings? i’ll be lurking on how everyone votes early on, but i’d love to hear any first impressions
[11:02:38] Drew: hey everyone, drew here. parker’s early silence could just be nerves, so i’m not ready to call them out yet. i’d rather see who’s quick to pile on adrian’s point—sometimes the loudest support can be just as telling as the initial accusation. kennedy, how are you reading this? and finley, any early gut feelings on where to look first
[11:02:59] Drew: drew: i’ll toss in a tentative vote for parker—silence on day 1 feels odd to me, though i’m perfectly happy to switch if someone else makes a better case. who’s next
[11:03:16] Drew: i’m going to hold off on voting for now—day 1 nerves can look a lot like mafia stealth. parker’s quiet start is worth noting, but i’d like more than radio silence. adrian, you were first to flag parker—what about that initial silence feels mafia-ish rather than just cautious? and kennedy (or finley), do you see any patterns in how folks are piling on or pushing back that seem more telling? let’s flesh that out before we lock in a vote
[11:04:15] Drew: drew: okay, a couple thoughts—adrian, i hear you on that reflexive deflection from parker, it did come off defensive. parker, thanks for tossing a vote on adrian—it helps balance things out. beyond parker, i’m also watching sidney’s quick jump to a tentative vote. sidney, what about parker’s silence stood out to you over someone like finley or tyler, who’d also been quiet? kennedy, tyler, finley—who’s your second gut pick right now? let’s each drop one more name and see if any patterns pop before we lock anything in
[11:04:28] Drew: hey everyone—i see tyler’s soft vote on me for “lurking,” but i’m genuinely trying to parse reads, not dodge. my main soft vote stays on parker for that day-1 silence. for a second suspect i’m eyeing adrian—that early, confident nudge on parker then swift deflection felt a bit too sharp for a casual bystander move. adrian, can you flesh out exactly what in parker’s tone or wording set off alarms for you? and sidney, finley, kennedy, tyler—what’s your secondary hunch? let’s list those so we can see where patterns overlap before we lock anything in
[11:05:21] Drew: i’m still holding my primary soft-vote on parker—day-1 silence plus that instant deflection felt off—and my secondary on adrian for jumping in so confidently without solid reads. 

adrian, can you quote the exact phrasing in parker’s intro that screamed “mafia” to you? tyler, what about my “lurking on votes” comment read mafia-style rather than cautious bystander behavior? 

if we don’t get a stronger, specific case against someone else in the next minute, i say we lock in parker and force a defense—let’s see real details before we move on
[11:11:22] Drew: drew: rough losing parker and then adrian last night—our mafia aren’t shy about taking out vocal bystanders. for day 2 let’s sharpen our reads: everyone name one suspect and quote the exact line or move that set off alarm bells. i’ll start: i’m soft-voting kennedy—her “if you can’t back up your reads, i’ll count you in” felt like corralling votes rather than offering her own analysis. sidney, tyler, finley—who’s your day 2 pick and what quote stuck out to you
[11:12:16] Drew: drew: five of us left and the suspicion scatter is too wide. i’m throwing a soft vote on tyler for now—that late vote on me felt more like splitting the table than a real read. finley, can you quote the exact line from tyler’s post that tipped you off? sidney, you just voted for adrian—he’s out, so did you mean tyler? kennedy, you flagged me and finley yesterday—what specific phrasing are you quoting? let’s get those exact quotes on the table before we lock anything in
