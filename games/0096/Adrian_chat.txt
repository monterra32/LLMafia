[11:02:16] Adrian: hey everyone, adrian here! excited to get day 1 rolling. since nobody’s spoken yet, i’m already a bit suspicious of parker—silence can be telling on day 1. no hard evidence though. who wants to go next and share any gut feelings or odd vibes you’ve picked up so far
[11:02:36] Adrian: hey everyone, adrian here! we’re on day 1 with no clues yet—so how about a quick icebreaker? let’s each name one person we’d vote for right now (even if it’s just a gut feel). it’ll help us spot who jumps on bandwagons or shifts around later. who wants to kick us off
[11:03:25] Adrian: kennedy, you asked why parker’s silence felt off—that’s my read too: day 1 bystanders usually at least pop in with a guess, but parker stayed completely quiet until we called them out, then flipped straight onto me, which feels a bit defensive in a way i’d expect from mafia. 

parker, if you really are just sizing everyone up, can you throw out a tentative gut vote? even a random guess shows whether you’re genuinely unsure or trying to steer. 

drew, tyler—anything about parker’s tone or choice of words that jumped out to you? 

and to everyone else, who’s got a quick gut hunch on someone besides parker? let’s get a few more angles before we lock in any votes
[11:03:47] Adrian: adrian: hey folks! quick clarification on why parker’s on my radar—it’s not just the day-1 silence, it’s pairing that with an almost instant pivot to accuse me instead of sharing any reads of your own. if you were just catching up, i’d expect something like “sorry, was reading through intros—i’m actually watching sidney because xyz.” so for now i’m keeping a soft vote on you.

but i don’t want to be the only one in the hot seat, so i’m also eyeballing tyler—lots of “i’m listening” but zero concrete hunches yet. tyler, who’s your gut suspect right now and what tipped you that way? and parker, care to drop another name you’re watching besides me? let’s spread the focus and see who really steps up with details
[11:04:06] Adrian: alright, let’s get some more angles before we lock onto parker. 

parker—if you’re genuinely unsure, throw a soft vote on someone else (say drew or tyler) so we can see if you’re reading the table or just dodging. 

drew, you’ve been “lurking on votes” so what’s your tentative gut pick right now? 

sidney, finley, tyler—any other names you’re quietly watching? if we get a second suspect, we’ll see whether votes cluster or parker keeps deflecting. then we can decide if parker deserves our day-1 test
[11:04:31] Adrian: okay, our soft votes on parker are at four now, and i’ve got two on me—so that’s a pretty clear lead on parker. 

parker, you’ve had plenty of time to weigh in: name one other person in this room you’re watching right now and why. 

tyler, you’ve been “listening” but haven’t given us a single hunch—who would you place a soft vote on and what detail tipped you? 

drew and sidney, you both tentatively backed parker—are you ready to lock that in, or do you need more from them (or from tyler) before we call this vote? let’s get some real reads on the table
[11:04:55] Adrian: okay, let me lay out exactly what set off my radar and propose a way forward:

parker, your very first post said you’d “be listening more than leading wild accusations,” yet the moment our group noted your silence you immediately shot back with “maybe we start with someone eager to point fingers—adrian, thoughts on kicking off with adrian?” that flip from neutral observer to quick accuser—without offering any own reads—feels like a classic deflection play rather than genuine day-1 caution.

if you really are just sizing everyone up, throw a soft vote on someone else (sidney or drew, for example) and explain why you’re watching them. that’ll show you’re actually reading the table instead of dodging.

as for me, besides parker i’m also keeping an eye on tyler—lots of “i’m listening” but no concrete hunch yet. drew, are you still leaning on parker or is your second suspect more compelling? tyler, finley, kenn­edy, sidney—who’s your #2 gut pick and what tipped you? let’s spread those soft votes around and see which names truly start to stick before we commit
