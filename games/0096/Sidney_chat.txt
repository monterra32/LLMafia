[11:02:24] Sidney: hey everyone! excited to get started. no one’s spoken yet, which makes it tough to pick a suspect, but often the first person who jumps in might be trying to steer the conversation—or total silence could be just as telling. what do you all think? any early gut feelings
[11:02:44] Sidney: sidney here! i’m also noticing parker’s radio silence—and in a group this size, that really stands out. i’m hesitant to lynch purely on that, but i’d like to put a tentative vote on parker to see if we can get them to speak up a bit. unless someone has a stronger read, i’ll stick with parker for now. thoughts
[11:03:18] Sidney: sidney: jumping in on adrian’s icebreaker, i’m tentatively voting parker. their initial silence and quick defensiveness when we called it out feels off for day 1. that said, i’m open-minded—drew, kennedy, tyler, finley, who’s your gut vote right now
[11:03:42] Sidney: sidney: interesting pivot to adrian, kennedy—but i’m still hung up on parker. radio silence for the first half-minute, then a quick deflection onto adrian feels dodgey. adrian at least gave reasons for flagging parker’s quiet; parker’s rebuttal just shifts blame without addressing that silence. i’m keeping my soft vote on parker—parker, what exactly makes adrian more suspect than your own no-show? anyone else still sticking with parker over adrian
[11:04:18] Sidney: sidney: you know what, i’m not convinced by parker’s silence alone—it’s too early to lynch on vibes. i’m going to shift my soft vote over to adrian as a test. adrian, you were the first to flag parker—can you quote the exact line in their intro that made you so sure? parker, what about adrian’s opening felt like a deflection rather than a genuine read? drew, tyler, kennedy, finley—anyone want to join a soft vote on adrian to see how he reacts? let’s spread these test votes and get some real answers before we lock anyone in
[11:04:57] Sidney: sidney: i’m on board with testing parker here. parker, you’ve had enough time to observe the table—what exactly jumped out at you in someone else’s post? quote a phrase or point to a detail in tyler’s, finley’s, or kennedy’s comment that felt off. if you can’t, your radio silence plus that quick flip on adrian looks like a dodge. i’ll keep my soft vote on you until we see something concrete. drew, tyler, kennedy, finley—does that seem fair
[11:05:31] Sidney: okay everyone, we’re down to the wire. i’m ready to lock in parker—day-one silence and that quick pivot to accuse me still feels dodgey. parker, if you genuinely have a read on someone else, toss a soft vote their way now; otherwise i’ll cast my vote on you. drew, tyler, kennedy, finley—any final reads or pivots before we seal this
[11:08:01] Sidney: wow, parker’s out—let’s see the reveal and whether we nailed a mafia or a bystander. either way, i’m still watching drew’s “lurking on early votes” line—it felt more like dodging heat than offering any real read. 

adrian, tyler, what stuck out to you most in today’s exchanges? if parker turns out to be a villager, what concrete behavior from drew (or anyone else) will you be tracking on day 2? let’s each name one pattern we’ll watch so we don’t misfire again
[11:08:26] Sidney: sidney: i’m with you on drew as our night kill. his “lurking on early votes” line is exactly the ammo the town needs to build a case, so when he’s dead in the morning it’ll look like a natural progression. let’s lock in drew
[11:08:41] Sidney: i’m on board with taking out drew tonight. his “lurking on early votes” line already has him pegged as suspicious, so eliminating him will reinforce that narrative and keep the heat off us. i’ll cast my kill on drew—let me know if you’re good to lock that in
[11:08:54] Sidney: sidney: i’m locking in drew as our night kill—his “lurking on votes” line gives us the perfect cover. let’s go ahead and submit drew
[11:09:07] Sidney: sidney: i’m locking in drew for our night kill—casting my vote on him now
[11:11:18] Sidney: sidney: i’m voting for adrian—he jumped on the parker lynch first thing without quoting a single line from my intro and then went quiet. adrian, can you point to the exact phrasing in my first post that convinced you i was suspicious? if not, i’ll stick with this vote
[11:12:01] Sidney: i’m throwing a soft vote on tyler—that late jump on drew felt more like bandwagoning than a genuine read. tyler, can you quote the exact line in drew’s posts that made you zero in on him? and kennedy, you flagged finley and me for driving the parker vote—what specific phrase in my day-1 comments read mafia-ish to you? drew, where are you leaning after watching all this? let’s get those quotes on the table before we lock anything in
[11:12:48] Sidney: i’m casting my vote on tyler. here’s the exact line that stuck out: tyler wrote “i’m going to soft-vote you to see how you defend it.” that feels like a probe more than a real read—classic mafia bait to flush out reactions.  

tyler, if you truly suspect someone, point to a specific quote or behavior that set you off. otherwise this just reads as a test play.  

drew, does a soft-vote test like that strike you as town-like or deflective? finley, kennedy—anything else in tyler’s wording that seals the deal for you? let’s get those specifics and lock this in
