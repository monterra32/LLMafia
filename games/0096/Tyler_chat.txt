[11:02:21] Tyler: hey everyone, tyler here! super excited to get started. day 1 and we don’t have much to go on yet, so let’s share our gut instincts—anyone already feeling dodgy about someone? i’ll hang back and listen, but i’m eager to hear your first impressions before we cast any votes
[11:02:41] Tyler: tyler: hey everyone, tyler here! i agree it’s early for hard reads, but parker’s radio silence does stand out. of course it could just be nerves, so i’m not ready to lock in on anyone yet. kennedy, sidney, finley—what are your gut feels so far? even a quick reaction might help us decide if we want to put a soft vote on someone to test the waters
[11:03:11] Tyler: i’m not totally sold on anyone yet, but if i have to cast a vote, i’ll tentatively put it on parker—his radio silence is standing out on day 1. parker, what’s your take on all this? any gut read or strategy you can share to put our minds at ease
[11:03:38] Tyler: tyler: i’ll tentatively soft-vote parker for now—day 1 silence plus that quick deflection feels off. parker, before i lock this in, can you point to one specific detail you noticed in someone else’s post (maybe something sidney or finley said) that caught your eye? a concrete read from you will help me decide—otherwise i’ll cast my vote soon
[11:04:08] Tyler: tyler: i’m going to tentatively put my soft vote on drew—his “lurking” comment felt more deflective than constructive. drew, who else besides parker is on your radar? and sidney, finley, kennedy, adrian—what’s one other name you’re watching right now? let’s list a few and see where we land
[11:04:25] Tyler: tyler: i’m going to soft-vote drew for now—he’s been talking about “lurking on votes” but hasn’t offered any concrete reads, and i want to see how he reacts. parker, can you throw a soft-vote on someone besides adrian (say drew or sidney) so we know you’re actually sizing up the table? drew, if you’ve got another name you’re quietly watching, now’s the time to share it. sidney, finley—any second suspects on your radars? let’s see whether these test votes cluster before we commit
[11:05:27] Tyler: tyler: okay everyone, our soft votes are all over the map—parker, adrian, drew and even me have tokens. before we lock anything in, let’s each back up our top pick with an exact quote:

• i’ll go first: drew’s line “i’ll be lurking on early votes” read to me like dodging responsibility rather than observing—that’s why i’m on drew.  
• adrian, what exact phrasing in parker’s intro set off your alarm bells?  
• parker, which precise words of adrian’s first call felt like a deflection?  
• sidney or finley or kennedy, pick your main suspect and drop the quote that sold you.

once we’ve got those specifics, we each cast one final vote and see where the real patterns lie
[11:11:51] Tyler: hey everyone, tough losses so far—parker was an innocent catch and now we lost adrian at night. that night kill tells me the mafia wanted to silence our loudest skeptic. looking back, sidney, you jumped on parker with “i’m hesitant to lynch purely on that, but i’d like to put a tentative vote on parker to see if they speak up.” can you point to the exact wording in parker’s post that read mafia-ish rather than just quiet nerves? i’m going to soft-vote you to see how you defend it. 

drew, finley, kennedy—who’s your day 2 target and what exact quote or behavior tipped you off? let’s back every suspicion with specifics before we lock in
[11:12:36] Tyler: tyler: i’m putting a soft vote on finley. in your last post you said “that late vote on drew felt like splitting the table instead of a real suspicion.” that reads to me as a weak push to flush reactions, not a genuine read—there’s no quote of what in my drew vote looked like “splitting.” finley, can you point to the exact phrase in my drew vote that struck you as manipulative rather than honest? drew, sidney, kennedy—does finley’s tactic here feel like a mafia probe to you, or am i missing something
[11:13:41] Tyler: tyler: okay, three people (sidney, kennedy and drew) have soft-voted me so far but haven’t quoted a single line from my posts as “proof.” finley at least pointed to drew’s “lurking on how everyone votes early on” remark. i’m shifting my soft-vote to drew now. 

drew – please quote the exact phrase in my posts that you read as mafia-style.  
sidney and kennedy – if you can’t point to a specific line of mine, please consider moving your votes to drew so we’re testing someone with an actual anchor.  

we need three solid votes on drew or three solid quotes on me up on the table before we lock this in
