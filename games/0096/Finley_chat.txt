[11:02:23] Finley: hey everyone, finley here! excited to get started. since it’s day 1 and we’ve got zero info, how about we each share our first impression or any gut feeling? i’ll kick things off: i don’t have a strong read yet, but parker’s been awfully quiet so far—could be nothing. what about the rest of you
[11:02:45] Finley: hey everyone, finley here—super excited for day 1! it’s really early, but i’ve noticed parker hasn’t said much yet—could be just easing in or maybe a stealth move. and adrian was pretty quick to flag parker off the bat—could be a genuine read or a classic deflection. parker, what are your thoughts so far? i’d also love to hear initial hunches from kennedy and sidney before we start casting any votes. anyone else picking up on anything odd
[11:03:08] Finley: i’m on board with a tentative vote on parker—silence this long, plus that quick deflection onto adrian, is enough to warrant a little test. i’ll throw my vote there too, just to see how parker reacts.

parker, if you really were just catching up on intros, what would you do in the next minute to prove you’re not hiding something? and adrian—what about parker stood out so strongly for you right off the bat, rather than letting everyone get a word in? let’s see how they respond before we lock anything in
[11:03:39] Finley: i’ll toss in a soft vote for parker—day 1 silence still feels like a red flag. parker, what made you switch gears and point at adrian instead of sticking with your own quiet read? adrian, what exactly about parker’s silence set off alarms for you so early? and tyler or kennedy, any gut impressions on either before we lock in
[11:04:37] Finley: i’m still leaning on parker—day-1 radio silence plus that quick deflection keeps feeling off. right now our soft votes are spread three on parker, one on adrian and one on drew. unless someone can give me a solid detail on adrian or drew that beats parker’s silence, i say we lock in parker. 

parker—before we finalize, toss a soft vote on either adrian or drew so we see if you’re genuinely undecided. and drew—can you pinpoint exactly what about “lurking on votes” reads mafia-style rather than just cautious bystander behavior? let’s get those specifics and then put a pin in this
[11:05:16] Finley: i’m shifting my soft vote over to adrian as a test. adrian, can you quote the exact phrase in parker’s intro that you found mafia-ish rather than just day-one nerves? and i’m dropping a second soft vote on tyler—tyler, you’ve been “listening” but haven’t offered any concrete reads. if you’ve got a gut feeling on someone, now’s the time to share it. let’s flush out some real reasons before we lock anything in
[11:05:33] Finley: i’m moving my soft vote on parker to a firm vote—day 1 radio silence plus that instant flip onto adrian is all we’ve got from you, parker. if you really have a gut read on someone else (say adrian, drew or tyler), please soft-vote them now and share the specific detail that tipped you off. otherwise i’ll count you in with parker. and if anyone here has concrete reasons to watch adrian, drew or tyler, speak up now—if not, let’s lock in parker and keep this rolling
[11:07:54] Finley: i vote for drew. his “lurking on early votes” line feels evasive and he hasn’t backed it up with any substantive reads, whereas parker at least engaged when pressed. if you’re not convinced on parker, consider locking in drew with me—sidney, tyler, kennedy, where do you stand
[11:08:25] Finley: sidney, i’m leaning toward killing drew tonight—he’s already on our “lurking on votes” narrative, so him dropping will look like we’re helping flush out a real suspect. adrian’s tempting because he’s the loudest, but that might put too big a target on us tomorrow. unless you really want to shut adrian up, i’ll cast our kill on drew. what do you think
[11:08:53] Finley: sidney, i’m thinking we take out drew tonight. that “lurking on early votes” line was too convenient and he never backed it up with a real read—he’s a ticking time-bomb in their discussions. removing him will leave them scrambling tomorrow. are you on board with drew, or do you still prefer to target adrian? let me know so we can lock it in
[11:09:05] Finley: finley: sounds perfect—locking in drew for our night kill. that “lurking on votes” angle will look natural come morning. see you then
[11:11:17] Finley: adrian got killed overnight—no surprise given how vocal he was yesterday. with five left (two mafia, three bystanders), we need strong reads. i’m throwing a soft vote on tyler—that late vote on drew felt like splitting the table instead of a real suspicion. drew, kennedy, sidney—who are you suspecting right now, and what exact line or action tipped you off? let’s get those specifics in before we lock anything down
[11:12:06] Finley: morning all—tough wake-up after adrian’s gone. let’s get sharper for day 2: each of us pick one line or moment from yesterday that rang alarm bells and say who it points to now. i’ll kick us off: drew’s “i’ll be lurking on how everyone votes early on” felt evasive, so he’s on my radar. who’s next
[11:12:54] Finley: finley: i vote for tyler. his line “that night kill tells me the mafia wanted to silence our loudest skeptic” felt like a narrative shove rather than genuine analysis, and he still hasn’t backed it up with any specific quotes from anyone else. let’s lock in tyler now. drew, kennedy—are you in
[11:14:31] Finley: everyone, we’re stuck in a three-way split (drew→sidney, kennedy→tyler, tyler→drew) and it’s letting the real mafia slip by. i’m locking in my vote on tyler—his “i’m going to soft‐vote you to see how you defend it” was just a probe with zero real read, and his “night kill silenced our loudest skeptic” narrative felt like bait, not analysis. drew, sidney—will you join me on tyler? if you’re convinced by someone else, quote the exact line that sold you so we can break this deadlock. otherwise let’s put tyler on the spot
