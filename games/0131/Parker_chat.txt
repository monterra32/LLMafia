[17:26:22] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! since we’re just kicking off day 1, i’d love to hear your gut reactions—who’s standing out to you so far? i’ll admit, i’m keeping an eye on the quieter corners of the chat, but i’m all ears for your thoughts
[17:26:50] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! sorry i’ve been quiet—just soaking it all in. for my lightning-round pick, i’m actually most suspicious of dakota: total silence so far feels a bit too convenient. kennedy, you called me out on radio silence—point taken, i’ve been getting my bearings. ray and sam, you both made solid observations about each other. now let’s hear from dakota: what’s your read so far? if we don’t get anything soon, i’m inclined to lean in that direction. thoughts
[17:27:12] Parker: hey everyone! i’ve been quiet because i wanted to take it all in, but i don’t think “quiet” alone is enough to lynch on day 1. right now sam has two people flagging them for silence—ray, dakota, what else are you picking up on with sam? kennedy, you mentioned me—aside from me hanging back, is there anything i said that struck you as odd? and sam, you’ve been asked a couple times now: any small detail or gut read you can share? i’d like to build something a bit more concrete before we cast any votes. thoughts
[17:27:24] Parker: nice call, dakota. kennedy, i’ll admit your opener is slick, but it could be genuine enthusiasm. i’m also still mulling over sam’s radio silence. 

sam—what’s your quick gut read now that we’ve heard a few takes?  
ray—you mentioned past “fly under the radar” plays—can you give a concrete example?  

once we have those, how about a no-pressure straw poll: everyone names their top suspect right now so we can see where the table stands. sound good?
