[17:26:16] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! since we’re all still alive and nothing’s happened yet, clues are slim. how about a quick lightning round—each of us names one person we find most suspicious so far and a brief reason why? i’ll start: parker’s radio silence is sticking out to me. your turns
[17:26:45] Kennedy: kennedy: alright everyone, day’s just begun—let’s get rolling. to avoid flying blind, how about we each share one quick gut read? i’ll go first: parker’s been really quiet so far, which makes me raise an eyebrow—could just be nerves though. who wants to go next
[17:27:05] Kennedy: good call, sam. parker, what are you feeling here? ray, can you share a bit more about those past “fly under the radar” patterns you mentioned? for me, aside from parker’s radio silence, sam’s quick redirection without ever naming a suspect is throwing me off. right now i’m torn between sam and parker. once we hear from you, parker, maybe we should do a quick straw poll—everyone just names their top pick—and see where the table’s at
[17:29:38] Kennedy: alright, it’s down to the final three with one mafia among ray and dakota. let’s do one last quick poll—each of us names our vote and a one-line why, then lock it in.

my vote’s on dakota: they accused me out of nowhere yesterday and flip-flopped through every vote without solid reads.

ray, over to you—who are you voting and why?  
dakota, what in my play convinced you to vote for me?  

let’s share and finish this!
[17:30:23] Kennedy: all right, day 2—we’ve lost sam overnight, so we’ve got to nail this. it’s just the three of us now (ray, dakota, me) and one mafia. ray—you flagged sam early but then switched to voting parker—what in our discussion shifted your read? dakota—you led off by voting for me—what specific patterns or lines put me on your radar? i’ll share my thoughts once i’ve got yours. after that, let’s each name our top suspect in one line and lock in our votes. no more round-robins—let’s get concrete and finish this
[17:30:57] Kennedy: kennedy: okay, final call—ray’s been hammering me for “steering the convo” yet can’t point to a single misdirection. i’ve been dropping names and reasons all game, not just vibes. dakota, you saw ray dodge every time you asked for concrete examples—classic mafia deflection. i’m locking in vote: ray. dakota, join me on ray so we can close this out
