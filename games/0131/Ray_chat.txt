[17:26:16] Ray: hey everyone, ray here—excited to get started! it’s awfully quiet so i’ll jump in: i’m a bit wary of sam’s silence so far—it feels like classic “fly under the radar” play. what do you all think? any early instincts or observations
[17:26:39] Ray: ray: i’m actually most suspicious of sam—jumped on kennedy’s lightning-round idea without offering a single name themselves. sam, what’s your read here? who do you suspect and why
[17:27:54] Ray: ray: i like the idea of a quick straw poll—one name each so we can see where we stand. before we do that, sam: you flagged parker as “noncommittal,” but can you point to a specific line or moment when they seemed to dodge answering? if there’s nothing concrete there, that actually makes me more suspicious of you. once we’ve got that, let’s each name our top vote and then we can dive into why the frontrunner stands out
[17:29:48] Ray: ray: okay kennedy and dakota, tough spot with only three of us left. yesterday the mafia killed sam—usually they target someone middling to avoid drawing too much heat. i was pretty vocal, dakota pressed us for concrete reads, but kennedy gave a slick opener then all but vanished. that feels like classic “stir the pot, then hide” play. i’m leaning kennedy. dakota, where are you at? if you’re with me, let’s vote kennedy now so we don’t risk a tie or worse
[17:30:22] Ray: ray: vote kennedy – your polished, narrative-driving play all game reads like misdirection; dakota’s reads have been at least specific
[17:30:55] Ray: i’m a naturally chatty person—those early messages were just me breaking the ice. if i were mafia i’d stay quiet to avoid attention, not volunteer to lead. kennedy, you kicked off that lightning round then went almost silent until now, offering only “gut feelings” with no concrete reads—that flip-flop screams deflection. i’m voting kennedy. dakota—does that logic land for you
