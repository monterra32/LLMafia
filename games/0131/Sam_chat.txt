[17:26:19] Sam: hey everyone, sam here! day 1 can be tricky with zero reads, so i thought we could start by tossing around any little red flags or odd vibes—even if they’re just gut feelings. for me, total silence from ray feels a bit deliberate…though i could be overthinking. what are you all picking up so far
[17:26:40] Sam: hey everyone, sam here! before we zero in, let’s give parker a chance to speak up—parker, what’s your gut so far? ray, you flagged my silence as “fly under the radar” play—what patterns have you seen in past games that tip you off? and kennedy, beyond parker’s quiet, is there anything else you’re picking up? for my part i’m eyeing parker too until we hear from them, but let’s gather a bit more before casting votes
[17:27:16] Sam: sam: hey ray, just to clarify—i did flag you when i mentioned your silence felt deliberate, so i’m not just lurking. but shifting focus, parker’s been oddly noncommittal: asking for gut-checks but never naming anyone. parker, who’s on your radar? i’m leaning toward you until i hear otherwise. thoughts everyone
[17:27:49] Sam: hey all, here’s a quick gut pick to get us rolling: i’m leaning hard on parker. they were silent until everyone else had made names, then instantly flipped to suspect dakota without much reasoning—feels reactive, not investigative. my runner-up is kennedy, whose polished opener may be trying to steer things. but let’s do that straw poll kennedy suggested: each of us, one name and a one-line why. i’ll start with parker. ray? dakota? kennedy? over to you
