## CONTENT: Your name is Sam.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  
You were assigned the following role: bystander.

## CONTENT: [Summary(text='**Collecting opinions before voting**\n\nI think it might be helpful to gather more opinions before making a decision. I could also consider a softer approach and say something like, "I’m leaning towards Parker." \n\nNow, let’s create Sam\'s message. The user wants to keep it simple and exclude timestamps. So here’s how I’ll craft it: \n\n"Hey Ray, just a quick note—when I mentioned Ray’s silence was deliberate, I did name someone, so I’m not ghosting. Parker’s been agreeable but hasn’t shared their thoughts. Parker, who are you considering? This lack of ownership is a bit strange. Kennedy went first, and I’d like to hear more from Parker. What do you all think?"', type='summary_text'), Summary(text='**Crafting the final message**\n\nI’m leaning toward Parker right now but am open to other opinions. So here’s how I’ll frame Sam\'s message: \n\n"Hey Ray, I’ve pointed out your silence before, and now Parker’s lack of input is becoming concerning. Parker, you’ve asked for others’ reads but haven’t shared yours—what’s your take? I\'m leaning toward Parker unless I hear a compelling reason otherwise. \n\nAs for the format, we’ll prefix Sam\'s message. So, it should read, "Sam: Hey everyone, I did notice things and want to share my thoughts."', type='summary_text'), Summary(text='**Finalizing Sam\'s message**\n\nI think I’m ready to finalize Sam\'s message. Here it is:\n\n"Sam: Hey Ray, just to clarify—I did flag you when I mentioned your silence felt deliberate, so I’m not just lurking. But looking around now, Parker’s been oddly noncommittal; asking for gut-checks but never naming anyone. Parker, who’s on your radar? I’m leaning toward you unless I hear something else. What does everyone think?"\n\nThis version maintains a smooth tone and addresses Ray while inviting further discussion.', type='summary_text')]

## CONTENT: Your name is Sam.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [17:25:59].
The other players in the game are:
 Ray ( unknown ) 
 Parker ( unknown )

[17:26:16] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! since we’re all still alive and nothing’s happened yet, clues are slim. how about a quick lightning round—each of us names one person we find most suspicious so far and a brief reason why? i’ll start: parker’s radio silence is sticking out to me. your turns
[17:26:16] Ray: hey everyone, ray here—excited to get started! it’s awfully quiet so i’ll jump in: i’m a bit wary of sam’s silence so far—it feels like classic “fly under the radar” play. what do you all think? any early instincts or observations
[17:25:59] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:26:19] Sam: hey everyone, sam here! day 1 can be tricky with zero reads, so i thought we could start by tossing around any little red flags or odd vibes—even if they’re just gut feelings. for me, total silence from ray feels a bit deliberate…though i could be overthinking. what are you all picking up so far
[17:26:22] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! since we’re just kicking off day 1, i’d love to hear your gut reactions—who’s standing out to you so far? i’ll admit, i’m keeping an eye on the quieter corners of the chat, but i’m all ears for your thoughts
[17:26:23] Dakota: hi everyone, dakota here! since we’re fresh into day 1 with no real info yet, let’s do a quick gut-check round: share your name and one person you find most suspicious so far (even if it’s random). i’ll start: dakota – i’m feeling a bit wary of sam; they’ve been awfully quiet! who’s next
[17:26:39] Ray: ray: i’m actually most suspicious of sam—jumped on kennedy’s lightning-round idea without offering a single name themselves. sam, what’s your read here? who do you suspect and why
[17:26:40] Sam: hey everyone, sam here! before we zero in, let’s give parker a chance to speak up—parker, what’s your gut so far? ray, you flagged my silence as “fly under the radar” play—what patterns have you seen in past games that tip you off? and kennedy, beyond parker’s quiet, is there anything else you’re picking up? for my part i’m eyeing parker too until we hear from them, but let’s gather a bit more before casting votes
[17:26:45] Kennedy: kennedy: alright everyone, day’s just begun—let’s get rolling. to avoid flying blind, how about we each share one quick gut read? i’ll go first: parker’s been really quiet so far, which makes me raise an eyebrow—could just be nerves though. who wants to go next
[17:26:50] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! sorry i’ve been quiet—just soaking it all in. for my lightning-round pick, i’m actually most suspicious of dakota: total silence so far feels a bit too convenient. kennedy, you called me out on radio silence—point taken, i’ve been getting my bearings. ray and sam, you both made solid observations about each other. now let’s hear from dakota: what’s your read so far? if we don’t get anything soon, i’m inclined to lean in that direction. thoughts
[17:26:56] Dakota: dakota: hey everyone, dakota here! i like the lightning-round idea, but i’m actually a bit suspicious of kennedy—your opener feels awfully put-together, like you’re steering the convo. could be harmless enthusiasm, though. parker, what do you think of that
[17:27:05] Kennedy: good call, sam. parker, what are you feeling here? ray, can you share a bit more about those past “fly under the radar” patterns you mentioned? for me, aside from parker’s radio silence, sam’s quick redirection without ever naming a suspect is throwing me off. right now i’m torn between sam and parker. once we hear from you, parker, maybe we should do a quick straw poll—everyone just names their top pick—and see where the table’s at
[17:27:12] Parker: hey everyone! i’ve been quiet because i wanted to take it all in, but i don’t think “quiet” alone is enough to lynch on day 1. right now sam has two people flagging them for silence—ray, dakota, what else are you picking up on with sam? kennedy, you mentioned me—aside from me hanging back, is there anything i said that struck you as odd? and sam, you’ve been asked a couple times now: any small detail or gut read you can share? i’d like to build something a bit more concrete before we cast any votes. thoughts

## CONTENT: [Summary(text='**Analyzing suspects\' shifts**\n\nParker initially picked Dakota for silence, but quickly shifted to questioning others, which seems more reactive. Right now, my top suspect is Parker. Let\'s quickly name our top suspects and see if we agree—what about Ray, Dakota, or Kennedy? Also, could Sam ask Ray about that "fly under the radar" pattern? I think it may connect to Parker\'s sudden shift, and Dakota’s switch from flagging me to choosing Kennedy deserves some clarity as well. Let’s finalize our picks!', type='summary_text'), Summary(text='**Deciding on suspects**\n\nShould we emphasize suspicion around Parker? It seems some bystanders suspect him, along with Sam, Kennedy, and Dakota. Parker stands out for Sam, so it makes sense to lead a straw poll favoring him. I think Sam could kick things off with a message like: “I’m leaning toward Parker for reacting rather than revealing thoughts. My second choice is Kennedy for leading the discussion with a polished approach. Let’s each name our top suspect with a brief reason. I’ll start with Parker.”', type='summary_text')]

## CONTENT: Hey all, here’s a quick gut pick to get us rolling: I’m leaning hard on Parker. They were silent until everyone else had made names, then instantly flipped to suspect Dakota without much reasoning—feels reactive, not investigative. My runner-up is Kennedy, whose polished opener may be trying to steer things. But let’s do that straw poll Kennedy suggested: each of us, one name and a one-line why. I’ll start with Parker. Ray? Dakota? Kennedy? Over to you.

## CONTENT: Your name is Sam.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [17:25:59].

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[17:26:16] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! since we’re all still alive and nothing’s happened yet, clues are slim. how about a quick lightning round—each of us names one person we find most suspicious so far and a brief reason why? i’ll start: parker’s radio silence is sticking out to me. your turns
[17:26:16] Ray: hey everyone, ray here—excited to get started! it’s awfully quiet so i’ll jump in: i’m a bit wary of sam’s silence so far—it feels like classic “fly under the radar” play. what do you all think? any early instincts or observations
[17:25:59] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:26:19] Sam: hey everyone, sam here! day 1 can be tricky with zero reads, so i thought we could start by tossing around any little red flags or odd vibes—even if they’re just gut feelings. for me, total silence from ray feels a bit deliberate…though i could be overthinking. what are you all picking up so far
[17:26:22] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! since we’re just kicking off day 1, i’d love to hear your gut reactions—who’s standing out to you so far? i’ll admit, i’m keeping an eye on the quieter corners of the chat, but i’m all ears for your thoughts
[17:26:23] Dakota: hi everyone, dakota here! since we’re fresh into day 1 with no real info yet, let’s do a quick gut-check round: share your name and one person you find most suspicious so far (even if it’s random). i’ll start: dakota – i’m feeling a bit wary of sam; they’ve been awfully quiet! who’s next
[17:26:39] Ray: ray: i’m actually most suspicious of sam—jumped on kennedy’s lightning-round idea without offering a single name themselves. sam, what’s your read here? who do you suspect and why
[17:26:40] Sam: hey everyone, sam here! before we zero in, let’s give parker a chance to speak up—parker, what’s your gut so far? ray, you flagged my silence as “fly under the radar” play—what patterns have you seen in past games that tip you off? and kennedy, beyond parker’s quiet, is there anything else you’re picking up? for my part i’m eyeing parker too until we hear from them, but let’s gather a bit more before casting votes
[17:26:45] Kennedy: kennedy: alright everyone, day’s just begun—let’s get rolling. to avoid flying blind, how about we each share one quick gut read? i’ll go first: parker’s been really quiet so far, which makes me raise an eyebrow—could just be nerves though. who wants to go next
[17:26:50] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! sorry i’ve been quiet—just soaking it all in. for my lightning-round pick, i’m actually most suspicious of dakota: total silence so far feels a bit too convenient. kennedy, you called me out on radio silence—point taken, i’ve been getting my bearings. ray and sam, you both made solid observations about each other. now let’s hear from dakota: what’s your read so far? if we don’t get anything soon, i’m inclined to lean in that direction. thoughts
[17:26:56] Dakota: dakota: hey everyone, dakota here! i like the lightning-round idea, but i’m actually a bit suspicious of kennedy—your opener feels awfully put-together, like you’re steering the convo. could be harmless enthusiasm, though. parker, what do you think of that
[17:27:05] Kennedy: good call, sam. parker, what are you feeling here? ray, can you share a bit more about those past “fly under the radar” patterns you mentioned? for me, aside from parker’s radio silence, sam’s quick redirection without ever naming a suspect is throwing me off. right now i’m torn between sam and parker. once we hear from you, parker, maybe we should do a quick straw poll—everyone just names their top pick—and see where the table’s at
[17:27:12] Parker: hey everyone! i’ve been quiet because i wanted to take it all in, but i don’t think “quiet” alone is enough to lynch on day 1. right now sam has two people flagging them for silence—ray, dakota, what else are you picking up on with sam? kennedy, you mentioned me—aside from me hanging back, is there anything i said that struck you as odd? and sam, you’ve been asked a couple times now: any small detail or gut read you can share? i’d like to build something a bit more concrete before we cast any votes. thoughts
[17:27:16] Sam: sam: hey ray, just to clarify—i did flag you when i mentioned your silence felt deliberate, so i’m not just lurking. but shifting focus, parker’s been oddly noncommittal: asking for gut-checks but never naming anyone. parker, who’s on your radar? i’m leaning toward you until i hear otherwise. thoughts everyone
[17:27:24] Parker: nice call, dakota. kennedy, i’ll admit your opener is slick, but it could be genuine enthusiasm. i’m also still mulling over sam’s radio silence. 

sam—what’s your quick gut read now that we’ve heard a few takes?  
ray—you mentioned past “fly under the radar” plays—can you give a concrete example?  

once we have those, how about a no-pressure straw poll: everyone names their top suspect right now so we can see where the table stands. sound good?
[17:27:26] Dakota: dakota: okay everyone, looks like sam and parker are tied on the suspicion meter. before we vote, let’s hear one quick line from each of them. sam—why did you wait to name someone? parker—what makes me more suspicious than the others? after that let’s lock in votes: vote: sam or vote: parker
Do you want to send a message to the group chat now, or do you prefer to wait for now and see what messages others will send? Remember to choose to send a message only if your contribution to the discussion in the current time will be meaningful enough. Don't overflow the discussion with your messages! Pay attention to the amount of messages with your name compared to the amount of messages with names of other players and let them have their turn too! Check the speaker name in the last few messages, and decide accordingly based on whether you talked too much. Reply only with `<send>` if you want to send a message now, or only with `<wait>` if you want to wait for now, based on your decision!

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[17:26:16] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! since we’re all still alive and nothing’s happened yet, clues are slim. how about a quick lightning round—each of us names one person we find most suspicious so far and a brief reason why? i’ll start: parker’s radio silence is sticking out to me. your turns
[17:26:16] Ray: hey everyone, ray here—excited to get started! it’s awfully quiet so i’ll jump in: i’m a bit wary of sam’s silence so far—it feels like classic “fly under the radar” play. what do you all think? any early instincts or observations
[17:25:59] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:26:19] Sam: hey everyone, sam here! day 1 can be tricky with zero reads, so i thought we could start by tossing around any little red flags or odd vibes—even if they’re just gut feelings. for me, total silence from ray feels a bit deliberate…though i could be overthinking. what are you all picking up so far
[17:26:22] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! since we’re just kicking off day 1, i’d love to hear your gut reactions—who’s standing out to you so far? i’ll admit, i’m keeping an eye on the quieter corners of the chat, but i’m all ears for your thoughts
[17:26:23] Dakota: hi everyone, dakota here! since we’re fresh into day 1 with no real info yet, let’s do a quick gut-check round: share your name and one person you find most suspicious so far (even if it’s random). i’ll start: dakota – i’m feeling a bit wary of sam; they’ve been awfully quiet! who’s next
[17:26:39] Ray: ray: i’m actually most suspicious of sam—jumped on kennedy’s lightning-round idea without offering a single name themselves. sam, what’s your read here? who do you suspect and why
[17:26:40] Sam: hey everyone, sam here! before we zero in, let’s give parker a chance to speak up—parker, what’s your gut so far? ray, you flagged my silence as “fly under the radar” play—what patterns have you seen in past games that tip you off? and kennedy, beyond parker’s quiet, is there anything else you’re picking up? for my part i’m eyeing parker too until we hear from them, but let’s gather a bit more before casting votes
[17:26:45] Kennedy: kennedy: alright everyone, day’s just begun—let’s get rolling. to avoid flying blind, how about we each share one quick gut read? i’ll go first: parker’s been really quiet so far, which makes me raise an eyebrow—could just be nerves though. who wants to go next
[17:26:50] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! sorry i’ve been quiet—just soaking it all in. for my lightning-round pick, i’m actually most suspicious of dakota: total silence so far feels a bit too convenient. kennedy, you called me out on radio silence—point taken, i’ve been getting my bearings. ray and sam, you both made solid observations about each other. now let’s hear from dakota: what’s your read so far? if we don’t get anything soon, i’m inclined to lean in that direction. thoughts
[17:26:56] Dakota: dakota: hey everyone, dakota here! i like the lightning-round idea, but i’m actually a bit suspicious of kennedy—your opener feels awfully put-together, like you’re steering the convo. could be harmless enthusiasm, though. parker, what do you think of that
[17:27:05] Kennedy: good call, sam. parker, what are you feeling here? ray, can you share a bit more about those past “fly under the radar” patterns you mentioned? for me, aside from parker’s radio silence, sam’s quick redirection without ever naming a suspect is throwing me off. right now i’m torn between sam and parker. once we hear from you, parker, maybe we should do a quick straw poll—everyone just names their top pick—and see where the table’s at
[17:27:12] Parker: hey everyone! i’ve been quiet because i wanted to take it all in, but i don’t think “quiet” alone is enough to lynch on day 1. right now sam has two people flagging them for silence—ray, dakota, what else are you picking up on with sam? kennedy, you mentioned me—aside from me hanging back, is there anything i said that struck you as odd? and sam, you’ve been asked a couple times now: any small detail or gut read you can share? i’d like to build something a bit more concrete before we cast any votes. thoughts
[17:27:16] Sam: sam: hey ray, just to clarify—i did flag you when i mentioned your silence felt deliberate, so i’m not just lurking. but shifting focus, parker’s been oddly noncommittal: asking for gut-checks but never naming anyone. parker, who’s on your radar? i’m leaning toward you until i hear otherwise. thoughts everyone
[17:27:24] Parker: nice call, dakota. kennedy, i’ll admit your opener is slick, but it could be genuine enthusiasm. i’m also still mulling over sam’s radio silence. 

sam—what’s your quick gut read now that we’ve heard a few takes?  
ray—you mentioned past “fly under the radar” plays—can you give a concrete example?  

once we have those, how about a no-pressure straw poll: everyone names their top suspect right now so we can see where the table stands. sound good?
[17:27:26] Dakota: dakota: okay everyone, looks like sam and parker are tied on the suspicion meter. before we vote, let’s hear one quick line from each of them. sam—why did you wait to name someone? parker—what makes me more suspicious than the others? after that let’s lock in votes: vote: sam or vote: parker
[17:27:49] Sam: hey all, here’s a quick gut pick to get us rolling: i’m leaning hard on parker. they were silent until everyone else had made names, then instantly flipped to suspect dakota without much reasoning—feels reactive, not investigative. my runner-up is kennedy, whose polished opener may be trying to steer things. but let’s do that straw poll kennedy suggested: each of us, one name and a one-line why. i’ll start with parker. ray? dakota? kennedy? over to you
[17:27:54] Ray: ray: i like the idea of a quick straw poll—one name each so we can see where we stand. before we do that, sam: you flagged parker as “noncommittal,” but can you point to a specific line or moment when they seemed to dodge answering? if there’s nothing concrete there, that actually makes me more suspicious of you. once we’ve got that, let’s each name our top vote and then we can dive into why the frontrunner stands out
[17:27:55] Dakota: sounds good, parker. but first:

sam—now that we’ve heard a few takes, who’s your gut pick?  
ray—can you share a concrete example from a past game where someone “flew under the radar” and turned out to be mafia?

once we’ve got those, let’s do a quick, no-pressure straw poll. i’ll kick us off: my vote’s going on kennedy. sam? ray?
[17:27:59] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...

The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.
