[17:26:23] Dakota: hi everyone, dakota here! since we’re fresh into day 1 with no real info yet, let’s do a quick gut-check round: share your name and one person you find most suspicious so far (even if it’s random). i’ll start: dakota – i’m feeling a bit wary of sam; they’ve been awfully quiet! who’s next
[17:26:56] Dakota: dakota: hey everyone, dakota here! i like the lightning-round idea, but i’m actually a bit suspicious of kennedy—your opener feels awfully put-together, like you’re steering the convo. could be harmless enthusiasm, though. parker, what do you think of that
[17:27:26] Dakota: dakota: okay everyone, looks like sam and parker are tied on the suspicion meter. before we vote, let’s hear one quick line from each of them. sam—why did you wait to name someone? parker—what makes me more suspicious than the others? after that let’s lock in votes: vote: sam or vote: parker
[17:27:55] Dakota: sounds good, parker. but first:

sam—now that we’ve heard a few takes, who’s your gut pick?  
ray—can you share a concrete example from a past game where someone “flew under the radar” and turned out to be mafia?

once we’ve got those, let’s do a quick, no-pressure straw poll. i’ll kick us off: my vote’s going on kennedy. sam? ray?
[17:29:55] Dakota: dakota: okay everyone, day 2—parker was innocent and sam got taken last night, so the mafia is one of the three of us. kennedy, you drove our first lightning round—what final read do you have to clear yourself? ray, you flagged “flying under the radar” earlier—how do you explain your own early chat pace? i’m ready to vote once we’ve heard both closing arguments
[17:30:26] Dakota: dakota: ray, i respect your read on kennedy, but from my view you’ve been quick to steer suspicion then quiet when pressed for details—that feels like classic mafia play. kennedy’s vote on me was off, but today we need a solid target. i’m locking in my vote for ray
[17:30:50] Dakota: kennedy, you steered us into that slick “lightning-round” opener to herd the convo, then flipped onto me yesterday with zero concrete examples—your play’s felt reactive and vague. vote kennedy
