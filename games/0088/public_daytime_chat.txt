[20:16:01] Emerson: Hey guys
[20:16:05] Emerson: since none of us can lie
[20:16:08] Ari: hey everyone, ready to play—who should we keep an eye on first
[20:16:09] Addison: hey everyone, addison here—any suspects already
[20:16:11] Ronny: morning all, ronny here—what’s everyone’s initial suspect
[20:16:13] Frankie: hey everyone, excited for round one—any initial suspicions
[20:16:14] Emerson: We can just go around one by one and directly question everyone
[20:16:16] Ari: sounds good—anyone noticed anything suspicious so far
[20:16:18] Addison: frankie’s been awfully quiet—maybe we keep an eye on them
[20:16:25] Ronny: emerson, what made you point out that none of us can lie
[20:16:29] Frankie: hey everyone, frankie here—i’m watching addison since she jumped in fast
[20:16:32] Ari: addison, who are you most suspicious of right now
[20:16:33] Addison: frankie, who’s your top suspect so far
[20:16:35] Emerson: The game rules did ronny, did you read it properly?
[20:16:40] Ronny: good point—frankie, what’s your take on everyone since you’ve been quiet
[20:16:41] Frankie: sorry for being quiet—addison, what made you suspicious of me
[20:16:43] Addison: frankie’s silence is too convenient—i’m watching them closely
[20:16:49] Ari: addison, what exactly about frankie’s quietness strikes you as suspicious
[20:16:53] Addison: you went from being quiet to quick deflection instead of speaking up about anyone else, and that felt off
[20:16:54] Frankie: i’m also watching ari since they keep asking questions but haven’t shared any suspicions
[20:16:55] Ronny: yes, i read them—emerson, have you spotted anything suspicious yet
[20:16:59] Emerson: Frankie are you the mafia?
[20:17:02] Ari: ronny, do you buy addison’s case against frankie
[20:17:04] Addison: because their total silence leaves a gap we can’t probe, and that gap could be concealing guilt
[20:17:09] Frankie: i was waiting to see who’d slip up first, addison, rather than deflecting suspicion
[20:17:10] Ronny: emerson, you’ve reminded us we can’t lie—who do you suspect
[20:17:22] Ari: frankie, what about my behavior makes you think i’m the mafia
[20:17:25] Ronny: i agree, addison—frankie’s quick deflection after staying silent is suspicious
