[20:16:09] Addison: hey everyone, addison here—any suspects already
[20:16:18] Addison: frankie’s been awfully quiet—maybe we keep an eye on them
[20:16:33] Addison: frankie, who’s your top suspect so far
[20:16:43] Addison: frankie’s silence is too convenient—i’m watching them closely
[20:16:53] Addison: you went from being quiet to quick deflection instead of speaking up about anyone else, and that felt off
[20:17:04] Addison: because their total silence leaves a gap we can’t probe, and that gap could be concealing guilt
[20:18:37] Addison: i’m voting for frankie
