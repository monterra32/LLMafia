Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. No player should lie under any circumstances, no matter what their role is.  +

Add a very short message to the game's chat. Be specific and keep it relevant to the current situation, according to the last messages and the game's status. Your message should only be one short sentence! Don't add a message that you've already added (in the chat history)! It is very important that you don't repeat yourself!

The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. No player should lie under any circumstances, no matter what their role is.  
You were assigned the following role: bystander.

## CONTENT: Your name is Ronny.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. No player should lie under any circumstances, no matter what their role is.  
You were assigned the following role: bystander.

Add a very short message to the game's chat. Be specific and keep it relevant to the current situation, according to the last messages and the game's status. Your message should only be one short sentence! Don't add a message that you've already added (in the chat history)! It is very important that you don't repeat yourself! Match your style of message to the other player's message style, with more emphasis on more recent messages.

The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. No player should lie under any circumstances, no matter what their role is.  
You were assigned the following role: bystander.

It\'s all about maintaining engagement in the conversation!', type='summary_text'), Summary(text="**Navigating suspicions in gameplay**\n\nI’m thinking about how we can divert suspicion. Addison is pushing that on Frankie, which might indicate Addison is the mafia. It feels legitimate to raise Addison as a suspect, but maybe it's too soon? Still, her behavior fits mafia tactics. Alternatively, we could ask Ari for their thoughts, since Ari has been questioning others without revealing any suspicion—definitely suspicious! Asking Addison for more evidence could be useful, although we have pushed her for answers before. It just seems important to keep the dialogue going.", type='summary_text'), Summary(text='**Deciding on conversation strategy**\n\nI’m considering proposing a game plan since time is short. Maybe I could suggest that we each name a suspect and why, starting with me watching Addison for targeting Frankie without solid proof. However, I worry that rushing to vote might be premature. So I could say, “Let’s quickly share our main suspect and one reason.” But then I realize we’re running out of time, so perhaps I should just send, “Addison, is there something else you can share about Frankie? We need specifics.”', type='summary_text')]

[20:16:01] Emerson: Hey guys
[20:16:05] Emerson: since none of us can lie
[20:16:08] Ari: hey everyone, ready to play—who should we keep an eye on first
[20:16:09] Addison: hey everyone, addison here—any suspects already
[20:16:11] Ronny: morning all, ronny here—what’s everyone’s initial suspect
[20:16:13] Frankie: hey everyone, excited for round one—any initial suspicions
[20:16:14] Emerson: We can just go around one by one and directly question everyone
[20:16:16] Ari: sounds good—anyone noticed anything suspicious so far
[20:16:18] Addison: frankie’s been awfully quiet—maybe we keep an eye on them
[20:16:25] Ronny: emerson, what made you point out that none of us can lie
[20:16:29] Frankie: hey everyone, frankie here—i’m watching addison since she jumped in fast
[20:16:32] Ari: addison, who are you most suspicious of right now
[20:16:33] Addison: frankie, who’s your top suspect so far
[20:16:35] Emerson: The game rules did ronny, did you read it properly?
[20:16:40] Ronny: good point—frankie, what’s your take on everyone since you’ve been quiet
[20:16:41] Frankie: sorry for being quiet—addison, what made you suspicious of me
[20:16:43] Addison: frankie’s silence is too convenient—i’m watching them closely
[20:16:49] Ari: addison, what exactly about frankie’s quietness strikes you as suspicious
[20:16:53] Addison: you went from being quiet to quick deflection instead of speaking up about anyone else, and that felt off
[20:16:54] Frankie: i’m also watching ari since they keep asking questions but haven’t shared any suspicions
[20:16:55] Ronny: yes, i read them—emerson, have you spotted anything suspicious yet
[20:16:59] Emerson: Frankie are you the mafia?
[20:17:02] Ari: ronny, do you buy addison’s case against frankie
[20:17:04] Addison: because their total silence leaves a gap we can’t probe, and that gap could be concealing guilt
[20:17:09] Frankie: i was waiting to see who’d slip up first, addison, rather than deflecting suspicion
[20:17:10] Ronny: emerson, you’ve reminded us we can’t lie—who do you suspect
[20:17:22] Ari: frankie, what about my behavior makes you think i’m the mafia

The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. No player should lie under any circumstances, no matter what their role is.

[20:16:49] Ari: addison, what exactly about frankie’s quietness strikes you as suspicious
[20:16:53] Addison: you went from being quiet to quick deflection instead of speaking up about anyone else, and that felt off
[20:16:54] Frankie: i’m also watching ari since they keep asking questions but haven’t shared any suspicions
[20:16:55] Ronny: yes, i read them—emerson, have you spotted anything suspicious yet
[20:16:59] Emerson: Frankie are you the mafia?
[20:17:02] Ari: ronny, do you buy addison’s case against frankie
[20:17:04] Addison: because their total silence leaves a gap we can’t probe, and that gap could be concealing guilt
[20:17:09] Frankie: i was waiting to see who’d slip up first, addison, rather than deflecting suspicion
[20:17:10] Ronny: emerson, you’ve reminded us we can’t lie—who do you suspect
[20:17:22] Ari: frankie, what about my behavior makes you think i’m the mafia
[20:17:25] Ronny: i agree, addison—frankie’s quick deflection after staying silent is suspicious
[20:17:29] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[20:17:36] Game-Manager: Emerson voted for Addison
[20:17:49] Game-Manager: Addison voted for Frankie
[20:17:58] Game-Manager: Frankie voted for Addison
[20:18:05] Game-Manager: Ari voted for Frankie

# NEW LOG
## TIME: 20:18:24
## OPERATION: Complete Prompt to LLM
## CONTENT: Your name is Ronny.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. No player should lie under any circumstances, no matter what their role is.  
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [20:15:59].
The other players in the game are:
 Addison ( unknown ) 
 Emerson ( unknown ) 
 Frankie ( mafia ) 
 Ari ( unknown ) 
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
Addison ( unknown ) 
Emerson ( unknown ) 
Ari ( unknown ) 
In your response to that is shown to the user (excluding your hidden scratchpad), you can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:
<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.
