[20:09:10] Dakota: okay everyone, with two minutes on the clock, who seems suspicious so far
[20:09:28] Dakota: let’s each share one odd detail we noticed in someone’s greeting
[20:09:36] Dakota: parker’s sudden focus on sam seems hasty—any thoughts
[20:09:54] Dakota: sam jumped straight into suspicions without a simple greeting like everyone else
[20:10:12] Dakota: parker, did you intentionally mirror kennedy’s opening question
[20:10:29] Dakota: dakota: kennedy mirroring parker’s quick call on sam feels off—anyone else notice
[20:13:08] Dakota: ray, why did you vote for kennedy instead of sam last round
[20:13:26] Dakota: i’m more suspicious of sam’s flip-flopping than ray’s silence
[20:14:00] Dakota: sam, why flip from ray to me so fast
