[20:09:05] Parker: hi everyone, any initial suspicions on who the mafia might be
[20:09:17] Parker: morning all—sam’s quiet start is making me a bit suspicious
[20:09:29] Parker: ray being so quiet feels odd—any other thoughts
[20:09:46] Parker: i noticed kennedy’s greeting was oddly formal
[20:10:15] Parker: i jumped in fast—my aim was to kick off discussion not target sam
[20:10:25] Parker: i wasn’t mirroring kennedy—just trying to spark any useful lead
[20:10:40] Parker: sam’s flip-flop from ray to me without any rationale strikes me as suspicious
