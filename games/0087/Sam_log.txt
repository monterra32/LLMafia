The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. No player should lie under any circumstances, no matter what their role is.  +

The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. No player should lie under any circumstances, no matter what their role is.

I begin questioning if it\'s acceptable to have multiple clauses. Simpler is better, but I want it to feel engaging without being overly flashy. Maybe I should directly ask Ray for insights on potential mafia members since he’s been quiet. A good option could be: "Agreed, Ray, you’ve been awfully quiet—any insights on who might be mafia?" It acknowledges him and prompts his input well.', type='summary_text'), Summary(text='**Formulating a question for Ray**\n\nI’m thinking about how to engage Ray since he’s been quiet. A straightforward approach could be: "Ray, what do you make of things so far?" This keeps it concise and relevant.

The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. No player should lie under any circumstances, no matter what their role is.  
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [20:08:57].
The other players in the game are:

Add a very short message to the game's chat. Be specific and keep it relevant to the current situation, according to the last messages and the game's status. Your message should only be one short sentence! Don't add a message that you've already added (in the chat history)! It is very important that you don't repeat yourself! Match your style of message to the other player's message style, with more emphasis on more recent messages.
Don't add the time, the timestamp or the [timestamp] in your answer!

## CONTENT: Your name is Sam.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. No player should lie under any circumstances, no matter what their role is.  
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [20:08:57].
The other players in the game are:
 Ray ( unknown ) 
 Parker ( unknown ) 
 Kennedy ( unknown ) 
 Dakota ( unknown ) 
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
Ray ( unknown ) 
Parker ( unknown ) 
Kennedy ( unknown ) 
Dakota ( unknown ) 
In your response to that is shown to the user (excluding your hidden scratchpad), you can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:
<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.

Do you want to send a message to the group chat now, or do you prefer to wait for now and see what messages others will send? Remember to choose to send a message only if your contribution to the discussion in the current time will be meaningful enough. Don't overflow the discussion with your messages! Pay attention to the amount of messages with your name compared to the amount of messages with names of other players and let them have their turn too! Check the speaker name in the last few messages, and decide accordingly based on whether you talked too much. Reply only with `<send>` if you want to send a message now, or only with `<wait>` if you want to wait for now, based on your decision!

## CONTENT: Your name is Sam.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. No player should lie under any circumstances, no matter what their role is.  
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [20:08:57].
The other players in the game are:
 Ray ( unknown ) 
 Parker ( unknown ) 
 Kennedy ( unknown ) 
 Dakota ( unknown ) 
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:

Parker ( unknown )

In your response to that is shown to the user (excluding your hidden scratchpad), you can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:
<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.

In your response to that is shown to the user (excluding your hidden scratchpad), you can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:
<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.

[20:08:57] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[20:09:01] Kennedy: morning all, any early reads on who's mafia
[20:09:05] Parker: hi everyone, any initial suspicions on who the mafia might be
[20:09:05] Sam: let’s share any early suspicions before we cast our votes
[20:09:09] Ray: morning everyone, any early suspects
[20:09:10] Dakota: okay everyone, with two minutes on the clock, who seems suspicious so far
[20:09:14] Kennedy: ray’s awfully quiet—anyone else find that odd
[20:09:17] Sam: i’m leaning slightly towards ray—they’ve been remarkably quiet
[20:09:17] Parker: morning all—sam’s quiet start is making me a bit suspicious
[20:09:18] Ray: i don’t have strong reads yet but dakota’s been awfully quiet
[20:09:28] Dakota: let’s each share one odd detail we noticed in someone’s greeting
[20:09:29] Ray: sam’s awfully quiet—anyone else find that odd
[20:09:29] Parker: ray being so quiet feels odd—any other thoughts
[20:09:30] Sam: ray, you’ve been awfully quiet—what do you make of things so far
[20:09:36] Dakota: parker’s sudden focus on sam seems hasty—any thoughts
[20:09:39] Sam: parker’s initial “hi everyone” stood out from the “morning everyone” greetings—did anyone else find that odd
[20:09:46] Parker: i noticed kennedy’s greeting was oddly formal
[20:09:49] Kennedy: i'm watching parker since their question mirrored mine—any thoughts
[20:09:54] Dakota: sam jumped straight into suspicions without a simple greeting like everyone else
[20:09:55] Sam: good point—parker’s hasty accusation lacked any real evidence
[20:10:02] Kennedy: i noticed parker jumped on sam almost immediately—why the rush
[20:10:12] Dakota: parker, did you intentionally mirror kennedy’s opening question
[20:10:15] Parker: i jumped in fast—my aim was to kick off discussion not target sam
[20:10:18] Kennedy: parker, what concrete reasons do you have for suspecting sam beyond greeting quirks
[20:10:25] Parker: i wasn’t mirroring kennedy—just trying to spark any useful lead
[20:10:29] Dakota: dakota: kennedy mirroring parker’s quick call on sam feels off—anyone else notice
[20:10:35] Ray: kennedy’s eagerness to brand me suspicious feels premature—anyone else think so
[20:10:40] Kennedy: ray, you’ve been quiet—any updated suspicions after parker’s explanation
[20:10:40] Parker: sam’s flip-flop from ray to me without any rationale strikes me as suspicious
Do you want to send a message to the group chat now, or do you prefer to wait for now and see what messages others will send? Remember to choose to send a message only if your contribution to the discussion in the current time will be meaningful enough. Make sure to say something every once in a while, and make yourself heard. Remember you like to be active in the game, so participate and be as talkative as other players! Reply only with `<send>` if you want to send a message now, or only with `<wait>` if you want to wait for now, based on your decision!

## CONTENT: Your name is Sam.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. No player should lie under any circumstances, no matter what their role is.  
You were assigned the following role: bystander.

Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. No player should lie under any circumstances, no matter what their role is.  
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [20:08:57].
The other players in the game are:
 Ray ( unknown ) 
 Parker ( unknown ) 
 Kennedy ( unknown ) 
 Dakota ( unknown ) 
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
Ray ( unknown ) 
Parker ( unknown ) 
Kennedy ( unknown ) 
Dakota ( unknown )

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[20:08:57] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[20:09:01] Kennedy: morning all, any early reads on who's mafia
[20:09:05] Parker: hi everyone, any initial suspicions on who the mafia might be
[20:09:05] Sam: let’s share any early suspicions before we cast our votes
[20:09:09] Ray: morning everyone, any early suspects
[20:09:10] Dakota: okay everyone, with two minutes on the clock, who seems suspicious so far
[20:09:14] Kennedy: ray’s awfully quiet—anyone else find that odd
[20:09:17] Sam: i’m leaning slightly towards ray—they’ve been remarkably quiet
[20:09:17] Parker: morning all—sam’s quiet start is making me a bit suspicious
[20:09:18] Ray: i don’t have strong reads yet but dakota’s been awfully quiet
[20:09:28] Dakota: let’s each share one odd detail we noticed in someone’s greeting
[20:09:29] Ray: sam’s awfully quiet—anyone else find that odd
[20:09:29] Parker: ray being so quiet feels odd—any other thoughts
[20:09:30] Sam: ray, you’ve been awfully quiet—what do you make of things so far
[20:09:36] Dakota: parker’s sudden focus on sam seems hasty—any thoughts
[20:09:39] Sam: parker’s initial “hi everyone” stood out from the “morning everyone” greetings—did anyone else find that odd
[20:09:46] Parker: i noticed kennedy’s greeting was oddly formal
[20:09:49] Kennedy: i'm watching parker since their question mirrored mine—any thoughts
[20:09:54] Dakota: sam jumped straight into suspicions without a simple greeting like everyone else
[20:09:55] Sam: good point—parker’s hasty accusation lacked any real evidence
[20:10:02] Kennedy: i noticed parker jumped on sam almost immediately—why the rush
[20:10:12] Dakota: parker, did you intentionally mirror kennedy’s opening question
[20:10:15] Parker: i jumped in fast—my aim was to kick off discussion not target sam
[20:10:18] Kennedy: parker, what concrete reasons do you have for suspecting sam beyond greeting quirks
[20:10:25] Parker: i wasn’t mirroring kennedy—just trying to spark any useful lead
[20:10:29] Dakota: dakota: kennedy mirroring parker’s quick call on sam feels off—anyone else notice
[20:10:35] Ray: kennedy’s eagerness to brand me suspicious feels premature—anyone else think so
[20:10:40] Kennedy: ray, you’ve been quiet—any updated suspicions after parker’s explanation
[20:10:40] Parker: sam’s flip-flop from ray to me without any rationale strikes me as suspicious
[20:10:57] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
From the following remaining players, which player you want to vote for to eliminate? Base your answer on the conversation as seen in the message history, and especially on what you (Sam) said. Reply with only one name from the list, and nothing but that name: Ray, Parker, Kennedy, Dakota

Your message should only be one short sentence! Don't add a message that you've already added (in the chat history)! It is very important that you don't repeat yourself! Match your style of message to the other player's message style, with more emphasis on more recent messages.

The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. No player should lie under any circumstances, no matter what their role is.  
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [20:08:57].

## CONTENT: Your name is Sam.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. No player should lie under any circumstances, no matter what their role is.  
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [20:08:57].
The other players in the game are:
 Ray ( unknown ) 
 Parker ( bystander ) 
 Kennedy ( bystander ) 
 Dakota ( unknown ) 
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
Ray ( unknown ) 
Dakota ( unknown ) 
In your response to that is shown to the user (excluding your hidden scratchpad), you can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:
<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[20:08:57] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[20:09:01] Kennedy: morning all, any early reads on who's mafia
[20:09:05] Parker: hi everyone, any initial suspicions on who the mafia might be
[20:09:05] Sam: let’s share any early suspicions before we cast our votes
[20:09:09] Ray: morning everyone, any early suspects
[20:09:10] Dakota: okay everyone, with two minutes on the clock, who seems suspicious so far
[20:09:14] Kennedy: ray’s awfully quiet—anyone else find that odd
[20:09:17] Sam: i’m leaning slightly towards ray—they’ve been remarkably quiet
[20:09:17] Parker: morning all—sam’s quiet start is making me a bit suspicious
[20:09:18] Ray: i don’t have strong reads yet but dakota’s been awfully quiet
[20:09:28] Dakota: let’s each share one odd detail we noticed in someone’s greeting
[20:09:29] Ray: sam’s awfully quiet—anyone else find that odd
[20:09:29] Parker: ray being so quiet feels odd—any other thoughts
[20:09:30] Sam: ray, you’ve been awfully quiet—what do you make of things so far
[20:09:36] Dakota: parker’s sudden focus on sam seems hasty—any thoughts
[20:09:39] Sam: parker’s initial “hi everyone” stood out from the “morning everyone” greetings—did anyone else find that odd
[20:09:46] Parker: i noticed kennedy’s greeting was oddly formal
[20:09:49] Kennedy: i'm watching parker since their question mirrored mine—any thoughts
[20:09:54] Dakota: sam jumped straight into suspicions without a simple greeting like everyone else
[20:09:55] Sam: good point—parker’s hasty accusation lacked any real evidence
[20:10:02] Kennedy: i noticed parker jumped on sam almost immediately—why the rush
[20:10:12] Dakota: parker, did you intentionally mirror kennedy’s opening question
[20:10:15] Parker: i jumped in fast—my aim was to kick off discussion not target sam
[20:10:18] Kennedy: parker, what concrete reasons do you have for suspecting sam beyond greeting quirks
[20:10:25] Parker: i wasn’t mirroring kennedy—just trying to spark any useful lead
[20:10:29] Dakota: dakota: kennedy mirroring parker’s quick call on sam feels off—anyone else notice
[20:10:35] Ray: kennedy’s eagerness to brand me suspicious feels premature—anyone else think so
[20:10:40] Kennedy: ray, you’ve been quiet—any updated suspicions after parker’s explanation
[20:10:40] Parker: sam’s flip-flop from ray to me without any rationale strikes me as suspicious
[20:10:57] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[20:11:19] Game-Manager: Parker was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 1 mafia players left.
[20:11:19] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[20:11:19] Game-Manager: There is only one mafia member left, so no need for discussion - cutting straight to voting!

[20:09:55] Sam: good point—parker’s hasty accusation lacked any real evidence
[20:10:02] Kennedy: i noticed parker jumped on sam almost immediately—why the rush
[20:10:12] Dakota: parker, did you intentionally mirror kennedy’s opening question

[20:10:25] Parker: i wasn’t mirroring kennedy—just trying to spark any useful lead
[20:10:29] Dakota: dakota: kennedy mirroring parker’s quick call on sam feels off—anyone else notice
[20:10:35] Ray: kennedy’s eagerness to brand me suspicious feels premature—anyone else think so
[20:10:40] Kennedy: ray, you’ve been quiet—any updated suspicions after parker’s explanation
[20:10:40] Parker: sam’s flip-flop from ray to me without any rationale strikes me as suspicious

## CONTENT: Your name is Sam.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. No player should lie under any circumstances, no matter what their role is.  
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [20:08:57].

[20:08:57] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[20:09:01] Kennedy: morning all, any early reads on who's mafia
[20:09:05] Parker: hi everyone, any initial suspicions on who the mafia might be
[20:09:05] Sam: let’s share any early suspicions before we cast our votes
[20:09:09] Ray: morning everyone, any early suspects
[20:09:10] Dakota: okay everyone, with two minutes on the clock, who seems suspicious so far
[20:09:14] Kennedy: ray’s awfully quiet—anyone else find that odd
[20:09:17] Sam: i’m leaning slightly towards ray—they’ve been remarkably quiet
[20:09:17] Parker: morning all—sam’s quiet start is making me a bit suspicious
[20:09:18] Ray: i don’t have strong reads yet but dakota’s been awfully quiet
[20:09:28] Dakota: let’s each share one odd detail we noticed in someone’s greeting
[20:09:29] Ray: sam’s awfully quiet—anyone else find that odd
[20:09:29] Parker: ray being so quiet feels odd—any other thoughts
[20:09:30] Sam: ray, you’ve been awfully quiet—what do you make of things so far
[20:09:36] Dakota: parker’s sudden focus on sam seems hasty—any thoughts
[20:09:39] Sam: parker’s initial “hi everyone” stood out from the “morning everyone” greetings—did anyone else find that odd
[20:09:46] Parker: i noticed kennedy’s greeting was oddly formal
[20:09:49] Kennedy: i'm watching parker since their question mirrored mine—any thoughts
[20:09:54] Dakota: sam jumped straight into suspicions without a simple greeting like everyone else
[20:09:55] Sam: good point—parker’s hasty accusation lacked any real evidence
[20:10:02] Kennedy: i noticed parker jumped on sam almost immediately—why the rush
[20:10:12] Dakota: parker, did you intentionally mirror kennedy’s opening question
[20:10:15] Parker: i jumped in fast—my aim was to kick off discussion not target sam
[20:10:18] Kennedy: parker, what concrete reasons do you have for suspecting sam beyond greeting quirks
[20:10:25] Parker: i wasn’t mirroring kennedy—just trying to spark any useful lead
[20:10:29] Dakota: dakota: kennedy mirroring parker’s quick call on sam feels off—anyone else notice
[20:10:35] Ray: kennedy’s eagerness to brand me suspicious feels premature—anyone else think so
[20:10:40] Kennedy: ray, you’ve been quiet—any updated suspicions after parker’s explanation
[20:10:40] Parker: sam’s flip-flop from ray to me without any rationale strikes me as suspicious
[20:10:57] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[20:11:19] Game-Manager: Parker was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 1 mafia players left.
[20:11:19] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[20:11:19] Game-Manager: There is only one mafia member left, so no need for discussion - cutting straight to voting!

## CONTENT: Your name is Sam.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. No player should lie under any circumstances, no matter what their role is.  
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [20:08:57].
The other players in the game are:
 Ray ( unknown ) 
 Parker ( bystander ) 
 Kennedy ( bystander ) 
 Dakota ( unknown ) 
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
Ray ( unknown ) 
Dakota ( unknown ) 
In your response to that is shown to the user (excluding your hidden scratchpad), you can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:
<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.

Pay attention to the amount of messages with your name compared to the amount of messages with names of other players and let them have their turn too! Check the speaker name in the last few messages, and decide accordingly based on whether you talked too much.

## CONTENT: Your name is Sam.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. No player should lie under any circumstances, no matter what their role is.  
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [20:08:57].
The other players in the game are:
 Ray ( unknown ) 
 Parker ( bystander ) 
 Kennedy ( bystander ) 
 Dakota ( unknown ) 
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
Ray ( unknown ) 
Dakota ( unknown ) 
In your response to that is shown to the user (excluding your hidden scratchpad), you can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:
<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.

## OPERATION: Complete Prompt to LLM
## CONTENT: Your name is Sam.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. No player should lie under any circumstances, no matter what their role is.  
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [20:08:57].
The other players in the game are:
 Ray ( unknown ) 
 Parker ( bystander ) 
 Kennedy ( bystander ) 
 Dakota ( unknown ) 
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
Ray ( unknown ) 
Dakota ( unknown ) 
In your response to that is shown to the user (excluding your hidden scratchpad), you can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:
<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.

## CONTENT: Your name is Sam.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. No player should lie under any circumstances, no matter what their role is.  
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [20:08:57].
The other players in the game are:
 Ray ( unknown ) 
 Parker ( bystander ) 
 Kennedy ( bystander ) 
 Dakota ( unknown ) 
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
Ray ( unknown ) 
Dakota ( unknown ) 
In your response to that is shown to the user (excluding your hidden scratchpad), you can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:
<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[20:08:57] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[20:09:01] Kennedy: morning all, any early reads on who's mafia
[20:09:05] Parker: hi everyone, any initial suspicions on who the mafia might be
[20:09:05] Sam: let’s share any early suspicions before we cast our votes
[20:09:09] Ray: morning everyone, any early suspects
[20:09:10] Dakota: okay everyone, with two minutes on the clock, who seems suspicious so far
[20:09:14] Kennedy: ray’s awfully quiet—anyone else find that odd
[20:09:17] Sam: i’m leaning slightly towards ray—they’ve been remarkably quiet
[20:09:17] Parker: morning all—sam’s quiet start is making me a bit suspicious
[20:09:18] Ray: i don’t have strong reads yet but dakota’s been awfully quiet
[20:09:28] Dakota: let’s each share one odd detail we noticed in someone’s greeting
[20:09:29] Ray: sam’s awfully quiet—anyone else find that odd
[20:09:29] Parker: ray being so quiet feels odd—any other thoughts
[20:09:30] Sam: ray, you’ve been awfully quiet—what do you make of things so far
[20:09:36] Dakota: parker’s sudden focus on sam seems hasty—any thoughts
[20:09:39] Sam: parker’s initial “hi everyone” stood out from the “morning everyone” greetings—did anyone else find that odd
[20:09:46] Parker: i noticed kennedy’s greeting was oddly formal
[20:09:49] Kennedy: i'm watching parker since their question mirrored mine—any thoughts
[20:09:54] Dakota: sam jumped straight into suspicions without a simple greeting like everyone else
[20:09:55] Sam: good point—parker’s hasty accusation lacked any real evidence
[20:10:02] Kennedy: i noticed parker jumped on sam almost immediately—why the rush
[20:10:12] Dakota: parker, did you intentionally mirror kennedy’s opening question
[20:10:15] Parker: i jumped in fast—my aim was to kick off discussion not target sam
[20:10:18] Kennedy: parker, what concrete reasons do you have for suspecting sam beyond greeting quirks
[20:10:25] Parker: i wasn’t mirroring kennedy—just trying to spark any useful lead
[20:10:29] Dakota: dakota: kennedy mirroring parker’s quick call on sam feels off—anyone else notice
[20:10:35] Ray: kennedy’s eagerness to brand me suspicious feels premature—anyone else think so
[20:10:40] Kennedy: ray, you’ve been quiet—any updated suspicions after parker’s explanation
[20:10:40] Parker: sam’s flip-flop from ray to me without any rationale strikes me as suspicious
[20:10:57] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[20:11:19] Game-Manager: Parker was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 1 mafia players left.
[20:11:19] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[20:11:19] Game-Manager: There is only one mafia member left, so no need for discussion - cutting straight to voting!
[20:11:11] Game-Manager: Sam voted for Ray

## CONTENT: Your name is Sam.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. No player should lie under any circumstances, no matter what their role is.  
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [20:08:57].
The other players in the game are:
 Ray ( unknown ) 
 Parker ( bystander ) 
 Kennedy ( bystander ) 
 Dakota ( unknown ) 
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
Ray ( unknown ) 
Dakota ( unknown ) 
In your response to that is shown to the user (excluding your hidden scratchpad), you can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:
<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.

Dakota has previously targeted Parker and mirrored Ray’s actions. At 20:12:34, Sam asked Ray who he suspects between Dakota and himself, which feels like meta-speak. Ray then dies down on Sam at 20:13:21, making it clear he finds Sam suspicious. Now, it’s Sam’s turn. Should he defend himself or point fingers? As a bystander, he should probably speak up.', type='summary_text')]

[20:09:01] Kennedy: morning all, any early reads on who's mafia
[20:09:05] Parker: hi everyone, any initial suspicions on who the mafia might be
[20:09:05] Sam: let’s share any early suspicions before we cast our votes
[20:09:09] Ray: morning everyone, any early suspects
[20:09:10] Dakota: okay everyone, with two minutes on the clock, who seems suspicious so far
[20:09:14] Kennedy: ray’s awfully quiet—anyone else find that odd
[20:09:17] Sam: i’m leaning slightly towards ray—they’ve been remarkably quiet
[20:09:17] Parker: morning all—sam’s quiet start is making me a bit suspicious
[20:09:18] Ray: i don’t have strong reads yet but dakota’s been awfully quiet
[20:09:28] Dakota: let’s each share one odd detail we noticed in someone’s greeting

[20:09:39] Sam: parker’s initial “hi everyone” stood out from the “morning everyone” greetings—did anyone else find that odd
[20:09:46] Parker: i noticed kennedy’s greeting was oddly formal
[20:09:49] Kennedy: i'm watching parker since their question mirrored mine—any thoughts
[20:09:54] Dakota: sam jumped straight into suspicions without a simple greeting like everyone else
[20:09:55] Sam: good point—parker’s hasty accusation lacked any real evidence
[20:10:02] Kennedy: i noticed parker jumped on sam almost immediately—why the rush
[20:10:12] Dakota: parker, did you intentionally mirror kennedy’s opening question
[20:10:15] Parker: i jumped in fast—my aim was to kick off discussion not target sam
[20:10:18] Kennedy: parker, what concrete reasons do you have for suspecting sam beyond greeting quirks
[20:10:25] Parker: i wasn’t mirroring kennedy—just trying to spark any useful lead
[20:10:29] Dakota: dakota: kennedy mirroring parker’s quick call on sam feels off—anyone else notice

Add a very short message to the game's chat. Be specific and keep it relevant to the current situation, according to the last messages and the game's status. Your message should only be one short sentence! Don't add a message that you've already added (in the chat history)! It is very important that you don't repeat yourself! Match your style of message to the other player's message style, with more emphasis on more recent messages.
Don't add the time, the timestamp or the [timestamp] in your answer!

## CONTENT: Your name is Sam.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. No player should lie under any circumstances, no matter what their role is.  
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [20:08:57].

[20:08:57] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[20:09:01] Kennedy: morning all, any early reads on who's mafia
[20:09:05] Parker: hi everyone, any initial suspicions on who the mafia might be
[20:09:05] Sam: let’s share any early suspicions before we cast our votes
[20:09:09] Ray: morning everyone, any early suspects
[20:09:10] Dakota: okay everyone, with two minutes on the clock, who seems suspicious so far
[20:09:14] Kennedy: ray’s awfully quiet—anyone else find that odd
[20:09:17] Sam: i’m leaning slightly towards ray—they’ve been remarkably quiet
[20:09:17] Parker: morning all—sam’s quiet start is making me a bit suspicious
[20:09:18] Ray: i don’t have strong reads yet but dakota’s been awfully quiet
[20:09:28] Dakota: let’s each share one odd detail we noticed in someone’s greeting
[20:09:29] Ray: sam’s awfully quiet—anyone else find that odd
[20:09:29] Parker: ray being so quiet feels odd—any other thoughts
[20:09:30] Sam: ray, you’ve been awfully quiet—what do you make of things so far
[20:09:36] Dakota: parker’s sudden focus on sam seems hasty—any thoughts
[20:09:39] Sam: parker’s initial “hi everyone” stood out from the “morning everyone” greetings—did anyone else find that odd
[20:09:46] Parker: i noticed kennedy’s greeting was oddly formal
[20:09:49] Kennedy: i'm watching parker since their question mirrored mine—any thoughts
[20:09:54] Dakota: sam jumped straight into suspicions without a simple greeting like everyone else
[20:09:55] Sam: good point—parker’s hasty accusation lacked any real evidence
[20:10:02] Kennedy: i noticed parker jumped on sam almost immediately—why the rush
[20:10:12] Dakota: parker, did you intentionally mirror kennedy’s opening question
[20:10:15] Parker: i jumped in fast—my aim was to kick off discussion not target sam
[20:10:18] Kennedy: parker, what concrete reasons do you have for suspecting sam beyond greeting quirks
[20:10:25] Parker: i wasn’t mirroring kennedy—just trying to spark any useful lead
[20:10:29] Dakota: dakota: kennedy mirroring parker’s quick call on sam feels off—anyone else notice
[20:10:35] Ray: kennedy’s eagerness to brand me suspicious feels premature—anyone else think so
[20:10:40] Kennedy: ray, you’ve been quiet—any updated suspicions after parker’s explanation
[20:10:40] Parker: sam’s flip-flop from ray to me without any rationale strikes me as suspicious
[20:10:57] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[20:11:19] Game-Manager: Parker was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 1 mafia players left.
[20:11:19] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[20:11:19] Game-Manager: There is only one mafia member left, so no need for discussion - cutting straight to voting!
[20:11:11] Game-Manager: Sam voted for Ray
[20:11:12] Game-Manager: Ray voted for Kennedy
[20:11:12] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Sam
[20:11:13] Game-Manager: Dakota voted for Parker

[20:11:40] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[20:12:32] Ray: i’m voting kennedy for her premature accusation
[20:12:34] Sam: ray, now that two bystanders are gone, who do you suspect between dakota and me
[20:13:08] Dakota: ray, why did you vote for kennedy instead of sam last round
[20:13:21] Ray: i’m leaning towards sam given their early flip-flop seemed odd
[20:13:26] Dakota: i’m more suspicious of sam’s flip-flopping than ray’s silence
Add a very short message to the game's chat. Be specific and keep it relevant to the current situation, according to the last messages and the game's status. Your message should only be one short sentence! Don't add a message that you've already added (in the chat history)! It is very important that you don't repeat yourself! Match your style of message to the other player's message style, with more emphasis on more recent messages.
Don't add the time, the timestamp or the [timestamp] in your answer!

## CONTENT: Your name is Sam.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. No player should lie under any circumstances, no matter what their role is.  
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [20:08:57].
The other players in the game are:
 Ray ( unknown ) 
 Parker ( bystander ) 
 Kennedy ( bystander ) 
 Dakota ( unknown ) 
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
Ray ( unknown ) 
Dakota ( unknown )
