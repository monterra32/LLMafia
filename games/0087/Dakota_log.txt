The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. No player should lie under any circumstances, no matter what their role is.  +

The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander.

The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. No player should lie under any circumstances, no matter what their role is.

## CONTENT: Your name is Dakota.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. No player should lie under any circumstances, no matter what their role is.  
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [20:08:57].
The other players in the game are:

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.

Add a very short message to the game's chat. Be specific and keep it relevant to the current situation, according to the last messages and the game's status. Your message should only be one short sentence! Don't add a message that you've already added (in the chat history)! It is very important that you don't repeat yourself! Match your style of message to the other player's message style, with more emphasis on more recent messages.
Don't add the time, the timestamp or the [timestamp] in your answer!

[20:09:14] Kennedy: ray’s awfully quiet—anyone else find that odd
[20:09:17] Sam: i’m leaning slightly towards ray—they’ve been remarkably quiet

Add a very short message to the game's chat. Be specific and keep it relevant to the current situation, according to the last messages and the game's status. Your message should only be one short sentence! Don't add a message that you've already added (in the chat history)! It is very important that you don't repeat yourself! Match your style of message to the other player's message style, with more emphasis on more recent messages.
Don't add the time, the timestamp or the [timestamp] in your answer!

Do you want to send a message to the group chat now, or do you prefer to wait for now and see what messages others will send? Remember to choose to send a message only if your contribution to the discussion in the current time will be meaningful enough. Don't overflow the discussion with your messages! Pay attention to the amount of messages with your name compared to the amount of messages with names of other players and let them have their turn too! Check the speaker name in the last few messages, and decide accordingly based on whether you talked too much. Reply only with `<send>` if you want to send a message now, or only with `<wait>` if you want to wait for now, based on your decision!

## CONTENT: Your name is Dakota.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. No player should lie under any circumstances, no matter what their role is.  
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [20:08:57].
The other players in the game are:
 Ray ( unknown ) 
 Parker ( unknown ) 
 Sam ( unknown ) 
 Kennedy ( unknown ) 
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
Ray ( unknown ) 
Parker ( unknown ) 
Sam ( unknown )

In your response to that is shown to the user (excluding your hidden scratchpad), you can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:
<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.

## CONTENT: [Summary(text="**Analyzing Mafia game dynamics**\n\nThe user is navigating a Mafia game scenario with specific roles and messages from players. Parker just pointed out Sam's inconsistent behavior, which feels suspicious. Now, I’m considering whether to respond immediately or wait based on the recent chat activity.

After Parker’s recent message, Sam hasn’t had a chance to respond, and it's just past that message. If Dakota jumps in again, it could overshadow others since she’s already been quite vocal. Given there's no pressing need to vote or respond, it seems wise to wait. The conclusion, then, is to choose <wait>.", type='summary_text')]

[20:09:01] Kennedy: morning all, any early reads on who's mafia
[20:09:05] Parker: hi everyone, any initial suspicions on who the mafia might be
[20:09:05] Sam: let’s share any early suspicions before we cast our votes
[20:09:09] Ray: morning everyone, any early suspects
[20:09:10] Dakota: okay everyone, with two minutes on the clock, who seems suspicious so far
[20:09:14] Kennedy: ray’s awfully quiet—anyone else find that odd
[20:09:17] Sam: i’m leaning slightly towards ray—they’ve been remarkably quiet
[20:09:17] Parker: morning all—sam’s quiet start is making me a bit suspicious

[20:09:36] Dakota: parker’s sudden focus on sam seems hasty—any thoughts
[20:09:39] Sam: parker’s initial “hi everyone” stood out from the “morning everyone” greetings—did anyone else find that odd
[20:09:46] Parker: i noticed kennedy’s greeting was oddly formal
[20:09:49] Kennedy: i'm watching parker since their question mirrored mine—any thoughts
[20:09:54] Dakota: sam jumped straight into suspicions without a simple greeting like everyone else
[20:09:55] Sam: good point—parker’s hasty accusation lacked any real evidence
[20:10:02] Kennedy: i noticed parker jumped on sam almost immediately—why the rush
[20:10:12] Dakota: parker, did you intentionally mirror kennedy’s opening question
[20:10:15] Parker: i jumped in fast—my aim was to kick off discussion not target sam

[20:10:25] Parker: i wasn’t mirroring kennedy—just trying to spark any useful lead
[20:10:29] Dakota: dakota: kennedy mirroring parker’s quick call on sam feels off—anyone else notice

## CONTENT: Your name is Dakota.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. No player should lie under any circumstances, no matter what their role is.  
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [20:08:57].
The other players in the game are:
 Ray ( unknown ) 
 Parker ( unknown ) 
 Sam ( unknown ) 
 Kennedy ( unknown ) 
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
Ray ( unknown ) 
Parker ( unknown ) 
Sam ( unknown ) 
Kennedy ( unknown ) 
In your response to that is shown to the user (excluding your hidden scratchpad), you can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:
<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.

[20:08:57] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[20:09:01] Kennedy: morning all, any early reads on who's mafia
[20:09:05] Parker: hi everyone, any initial suspicions on who the mafia might be
[20:09:05] Sam: let’s share any early suspicions before we cast our votes
[20:09:09] Ray: morning everyone, any early suspects
[20:09:10] Dakota: okay everyone, with two minutes on the clock, who seems suspicious so far
[20:09:14] Kennedy: ray’s awfully quiet—anyone else find that odd
[20:09:17] Sam: i’m leaning slightly towards ray—they’ve been remarkably quiet
[20:09:17] Parker: morning all—sam’s quiet start is making me a bit suspicious

[20:09:36] Dakota: parker’s sudden focus on sam seems hasty—any thoughts
[20:09:39] Sam: parker’s initial “hi everyone” stood out from the “morning everyone” greetings—did anyone else find that odd
[20:09:46] Parker: i noticed kennedy’s greeting was oddly formal
[20:09:49] Kennedy: i'm watching parker since their question mirrored mine—any thoughts
[20:09:54] Dakota: sam jumped straight into suspicions without a simple greeting like everyone else
[20:09:55] Sam: good point—parker’s hasty accusation lacked any real evidence
[20:10:02] Kennedy: i noticed parker jumped on sam almost immediately—why the rush
[20:10:12] Dakota: parker, did you intentionally mirror kennedy’s opening question
[20:10:15] Parker: i jumped in fast—my aim was to kick off discussion not target sam
[20:10:18] Kennedy: parker, what concrete reasons do you have for suspecting sam beyond greeting quirks
[20:10:25] Parker: i wasn’t mirroring kennedy—just trying to spark any useful lead
[20:10:29] Dakota: dakota: kennedy mirroring parker’s quick call on sam feels off—anyone else notice
[20:10:35] Ray: kennedy’s eagerness to brand me suspicious feels premature—anyone else think so
[20:10:40] Kennedy: ray, you’ve been quiet—any updated suspicions after parker’s explanation
[20:10:40] Parker: sam’s flip-flop from ray to me without any rationale strikes me as suspicious
Do you want to send a message to the group chat now, or do you prefer to wait for now and see what messages others will send? Remember to choose to send a message only if your contribution to the discussion in the current time will be meaningful enough. Don't overflow the discussion with your messages! Pay attention to the amount of messages with your name compared to the amount of messages with names of other players and let them have their turn too! Check the speaker name in the last few messages, and decide accordingly based on whether you talked too much. Reply only with `<send>` if you want to send a message now, or only with `<wait>` if you want to wait for now, based on your decision!

## CONTENT: Your name is Dakota.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. No player should lie under any circumstances, no matter what their role is.  
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [20:08:57].
The other players in the game are:
 Ray ( unknown ) 
 Parker ( unknown ) 
 Sam ( unknown ) 
 Kennedy ( unknown ) 
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
Ray ( unknown ) 
Parker ( unknown ) 
Sam ( unknown ) 
Kennedy ( unknown ) 
In your response to that is shown to the user (excluding your hidden scratchpad), you can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:
<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.

Since both seem suspicious, Dakota needs to decide. They’ve pointed out that Parker's accusations lack evidence and seem ungrounded, while Kennedy’s mirrored questioning raises flags. Voting for either Parker or Kennedy feels prudent based on the observations.", type='summary_text')]

[20:08:57] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[20:09:01] Kennedy: morning all, any early reads on who's mafia
[20:09:05] Parker: hi everyone, any initial suspicions on who the mafia might be
[20:09:05] Sam: let’s share any early suspicions before we cast our votes
[20:09:09] Ray: morning everyone, any early suspects
[20:09:10] Dakota: okay everyone, with two minutes on the clock, who seems suspicious so far
[20:09:14] Kennedy: ray’s awfully quiet—anyone else find that odd
[20:09:17] Sam: i’m leaning slightly towards ray—they’ve been remarkably quiet
[20:09:17] Parker: morning all—sam’s quiet start is making me a bit suspicious
[20:09:18] Ray: i don’t have strong reads yet but dakota’s been awfully quiet
[20:09:28] Dakota: let’s each share one odd detail we noticed in someone’s greeting
[20:09:29] Ray: sam’s awfully quiet—anyone else find that odd
[20:09:29] Parker: ray being so quiet feels odd—any other thoughts
[20:09:30] Sam: ray, you’ve been awfully quiet—what do you make of things so far
[20:09:36] Dakota: parker’s sudden focus on sam seems hasty—any thoughts
[20:09:39] Sam: parker’s initial “hi everyone” stood out from the “morning everyone” greetings—did anyone else find that odd
[20:09:46] Parker: i noticed kennedy’s greeting was oddly formal
[20:09:49] Kennedy: i'm watching parker since their question mirrored mine—any thoughts
[20:09:54] Dakota: sam jumped straight into suspicions without a simple greeting like everyone else
[20:09:55] Sam: good point—parker’s hasty accusation lacked any real evidence
[20:10:02] Kennedy: i noticed parker jumped on sam almost immediately—why the rush
[20:10:12] Dakota: parker, did you intentionally mirror kennedy’s opening question
[20:10:15] Parker: i jumped in fast—my aim was to kick off discussion not target sam
[20:10:18] Kennedy: parker, what concrete reasons do you have for suspecting sam beyond greeting quirks
[20:10:25] Parker: i wasn’t mirroring kennedy—just trying to spark any useful lead
[20:10:29] Dakota: dakota: kennedy mirroring parker’s quick call on sam feels off—anyone else notice
[20:10:35] Ray: kennedy’s eagerness to brand me suspicious feels premature—anyone else think so
[20:10:40] Kennedy: ray, you’ve been quiet—any updated suspicions after parker’s explanation
[20:10:40] Parker: sam’s flip-flop from ray to me without any rationale strikes me as suspicious
[20:10:57] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...

## CONTENT: Your name is Dakota.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. No player should lie under any circumstances, no matter what their role is.  
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [20:08:57].
The other players in the game are:
 Ray ( unknown ) 
 Parker ( bystander ) 
 Sam ( unknown ) 
 Kennedy ( unknown ) 
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
Ray ( unknown ) 
Sam ( unknown ) 
Kennedy ( unknown ) 
In your response to that is shown to the user (excluding your hidden scratchpad), you can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:
<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.

## CONTENT: Your name is Dakota.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. No player should lie under any circumstances, no matter what their role is.  
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [20:08:57].
The other players in the game are:
 Ray ( unknown )

 Sam ( unknown ) 
 Kennedy ( bystander )

[20:09:05] Sam: let’s share any early suspicions before we cast our votes
[20:09:09] Ray: morning everyone, any early suspects
[20:09:10] Dakota: okay everyone, with two minutes on the clock, who seems suspicious so far

[20:09:17] Sam: i’m leaning slightly towards ray—they’ve been remarkably quiet
[20:09:17] Parker: morning all—sam’s quiet start is making me a bit suspicious

[20:09:54] Dakota: sam jumped straight into suspicions without a simple greeting like everyone else
[20:09:55] Sam: good point—parker’s hasty accusation lacked any real evidence
[20:10:02] Kennedy: i noticed parker jumped on sam almost immediately—why the rush
[20:10:12] Dakota: parker, did you intentionally mirror kennedy’s opening question
[20:10:15] Parker: i jumped in fast—my aim was to kick off discussion not target sam

[20:10:29] Dakota: dakota: kennedy mirroring parker’s quick call on sam feels off—anyone else notice

[20:09:05] Sam: let’s share any early suspicions before we cast our votes
[20:09:09] Ray: morning everyone, any early suspects
[20:09:10] Dakota: okay everyone, with two minutes on the clock, who seems suspicious so far
[20:09:14] Kennedy: ray’s awfully quiet—anyone else find that odd
[20:09:17] Sam: i’m leaning slightly towards ray—they’ve been remarkably quiet

[20:09:49] Kennedy: i'm watching parker since their question mirrored mine—any thoughts
[20:09:54] Dakota: sam jumped straight into suspicions without a simple greeting like everyone else
[20:09:55] Sam: good point—parker’s hasty accusation lacked any real evidence
[20:10:02] Kennedy: i noticed parker jumped on sam almost immediately—why the rush
[20:10:12] Dakota: parker, did you intentionally mirror kennedy’s opening question
[20:10:15] Parker: i jumped in fast—my aim was to kick off discussion not target sam
[20:10:18] Kennedy: parker, what concrete reasons do you have for suspecting sam beyond greeting quirks
[20:10:25] Parker: i wasn’t mirroring kennedy—just trying to spark any useful lead
[20:10:29] Dakota: dakota: kennedy mirroring parker’s quick call on sam feels off—anyone else notice
[20:10:35] Ray: kennedy’s eagerness to brand me suspicious feels premature—anyone else think so

## CONTENT: Your name is Dakota.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. No player should lie under any circumstances, no matter what their role is.  
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [20:08:57].
The other players in the game are:
 Ray ( unknown ) 
 Parker ( bystander ) 
 Sam ( unknown ) 
 Kennedy ( bystander ) 
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
Ray ( unknown ) 
Sam ( unknown ) 
In your response to that is shown to the user (excluding your hidden scratchpad), you can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:
<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.

## CONTENT: [Summary(text="**Analyzing game dynamics**\n\nIt seems we're in Day 3 of a game where two bystanders and one mafia are left. Initially, there were four players consisting of two mafia and two bystanders. After removing Parker and Kennedy, we're now at three players: Ray, Sam, and Dakota. To decide on the mafia, we need fresh prompts for our conversation since previous phrases have been overused. We might focus on either Ray, who has been quiet, or Sam, who has shown flip-flopping behavior and voted for Ray earlier.", type='summary_text'), Summary(text='**Reflecting on suspect dynamics**\n\nOnly one mafia is left, and I think targeting either Sam or Ray is ideal. As a bystander, I want to express suspicion. I could ask, "Ray, your vote for Kennedy felt random—what was your reasoning?" But maybe that\'s a bit lengthy. A clearer option is, "Ray, why did you vote for Kennedy instead of Sam last round?" It\'s important to reference the last round without drawing too much attention to ourselves. I might also consider asking Sam about his voting inconsistencies. It’s tricky to balance inquiry with subtlety!', type='summary_text'), Summary(text='**Assessing player dynamics**\n\nParker\'s elimination changed nothing in mafia count since he was a bystander. However, there’s a confusion about roles, as the game manager claims "no one lies." It’s now nighttime, with only one mafia left, which implies they must kill a bystander. Timestamps suggest the votes during Parker\'s elimination were off. The current survivors are Ray, Sam, and Dakota, with one mafia among them. I need to propose a suspicion, and I’m leaning towards Ray due to his quieter behavior, which feels a bit off.', type='summary_text'), Summary(text='**Formulating a question for Ray**\n\nI\'m planning to ask Ray directly: “Ray, why did you vote for Kennedy instead of Sam last round?” It\'s a straightforward question that’s relevant to our current situation. Although it\'s 16 words, it’s still clear and unique enough, not repeating anything I’ve previously mentioned, like how "Ray\'s awfully quiet." I feel confident this is a good choice for prompting the discussion without confusion. So, I’m going to use that exact phrasing.', type='summary_text')]

## CONTENT: Your name is Dakota.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. No player should lie under any circumstances, no matter what their role is.  
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [20:08:57].
The other players in the game are:
 Ray ( unknown ) 
 Parker ( bystander ) 
 Sam ( unknown ) 
 Kennedy ( bystander ) 
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:

Add a very short message to the game's chat. Be specific and keep it relevant to the current situation, according to the last messages and the game's status. Your message should only be one short sentence! Don't add a message that you've already added (in the chat history)! It is very important that you don't repeat yourself! Match your style of message to the other player's message style, with more emphasis on more recent messages.

[20:10:40] Kennedy: ray, you’ve been quiet—any updated suspicions after parker’s explanation
[20:10:40] Parker: sam’s flip-flop from ray to me without any rationale strikes me as suspicious
[20:10:57] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[20:11:19] Game-Manager: Parker was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 1 mafia players left.
[20:11:19] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[20:11:19] Game-Manager: There is only one mafia member left, so no need for discussion - cutting straight to voting!
[20:11:11] Game-Manager: Sam voted for Ray
[20:11:12] Game-Manager: Ray voted for Kennedy

Add a very short message to the game's chat. Be specific and keep it relevant to the current situation, according to the last messages and the game's status. Your message should only be one short sentence! Don't add a message that you've already added (in the chat history)! It is very important that you don't repeat yourself! Match your style of message to the other player's message style, with more emphasis on more recent messages.
Don't add the time, the timestamp or the [timestamp] in your answer!

## CONTENT: Your name is Dakota.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. No player should lie under any circumstances, no matter what their role is.  
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [20:08:57].
The other players in the game are:
 Ray ( unknown ) 
 Parker ( bystander ) 
 Sam ( unknown ) 
 Kennedy ( bystander ) 
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
Ray ( unknown ) 
Sam ( unknown ) 
In your response to that is shown to the user (excluding your hidden scratchpad), you can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:
<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.

## CONTENT: Your name is Dakota.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. No player should lie under any circumstances, no matter what their role is.  
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [20:08:57].
The other players in the game are:
 Ray ( unknown ) 
 Parker ( bystander ) 
 Sam ( unknown ) 
 Kennedy ( bystander ) 
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
Ray ( unknown ) 
Sam ( unknown )

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[20:08:57] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[20:09:01] Kennedy: morning all, any early reads on who's mafia
[20:09:05] Parker: hi everyone, any initial suspicions on who the mafia might be
[20:09:05] Sam: let’s share any early suspicions before we cast our votes
[20:09:09] Ray: morning everyone, any early suspects
[20:09:10] Dakota: okay everyone, with two minutes on the clock, who seems suspicious so far
[20:09:14] Kennedy: ray’s awfully quiet—anyone else find that odd
[20:09:17] Sam: i’m leaning slightly towards ray—they’ve been remarkably quiet
[20:09:17] Parker: morning all—sam’s quiet start is making me a bit suspicious
[20:09:18] Ray: i don’t have strong reads yet but dakota’s been awfully quiet
[20:09:28] Dakota: let’s each share one odd detail we noticed in someone’s greeting
[20:09:29] Ray: sam’s awfully quiet—anyone else find that odd
[20:09:29] Parker: ray being so quiet feels odd—any other thoughts
[20:09:30] Sam: ray, you’ve been awfully quiet—what do you make of things so far
[20:09:36] Dakota: parker’s sudden focus on sam seems hasty—any thoughts
[20:09:39] Sam: parker’s initial “hi everyone” stood out from the “morning everyone” greetings—did anyone else find that odd
[20:09:46] Parker: i noticed kennedy’s greeting was oddly formal
[20:09:49] Kennedy: i'm watching parker since their question mirrored mine—any thoughts
[20:09:54] Dakota: sam jumped straight into suspicions without a simple greeting like everyone else
[20:09:55] Sam: good point—parker’s hasty accusation lacked any real evidence
[20:10:02] Kennedy: i noticed parker jumped on sam almost immediately—why the rush
[20:10:12] Dakota: parker, did you intentionally mirror kennedy’s opening question
[20:10:15] Parker: i jumped in fast—my aim was to kick off discussion not target sam
[20:10:18] Kennedy: parker, what concrete reasons do you have for suspecting sam beyond greeting quirks
[20:10:25] Parker: i wasn’t mirroring kennedy—just trying to spark any useful lead
[20:10:29] Dakota: dakota: kennedy mirroring parker’s quick call on sam feels off—anyone else notice
[20:10:35] Ray: kennedy’s eagerness to brand me suspicious feels premature—anyone else think so
[20:10:40] Kennedy: ray, you’ve been quiet—any updated suspicions after parker’s explanation
[20:10:40] Parker: sam’s flip-flop from ray to me without any rationale strikes me as suspicious
[20:10:57] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[20:11:19] Game-Manager: Parker was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 1 mafia players left.
[20:11:19] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[20:11:19] Game-Manager: There is only one mafia member left, so no need for discussion - cutting straight to voting!
[20:11:11] Game-Manager: Sam voted for Ray
[20:11:12] Game-Manager: Ray voted for Kennedy
[20:11:12] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Sam
