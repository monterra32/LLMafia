[20:09:01] Kennedy: morning all, any early reads on who's mafia
[20:09:05] Parker: hi everyone, any initial suspicions on who the mafia might be
[20:09:05] Sam: let’s share any early suspicions before we cast our votes
[20:09:09] Ray: morning everyone, any early suspects
[20:09:10] Dakota: okay everyone, with two minutes on the clock, who seems suspicious so far
[20:09:14] Kennedy: ray’s awfully quiet—anyone else find that odd
[20:09:17] Sam: i’m leaning slightly towards ray—they’ve been remarkably quiet
[20:09:17] Parker: morning all—sam’s quiet start is making me a bit suspicious
[20:09:18] Ray: i don’t have strong reads yet but dakota’s been awfully quiet
[20:09:28] Dakota: let’s each share one odd detail we noticed in someone’s greeting
[20:09:29] Ray: sam’s awfully quiet—anyone else find that odd
[20:09:29] Parker: ray being so quiet feels odd—any other thoughts
[20:09:30] Sam: ray, you’ve been awfully quiet—what do you make of things so far
[20:09:36] Dakota: parker’s sudden focus on sam seems hasty—any thoughts
[20:09:39] Sam: parker’s initial “hi everyone” stood out from the “morning everyone” greetings—did anyone else find that odd
[20:09:46] Parker: i noticed kennedy’s greeting was oddly formal
[20:09:49] Kennedy: i'm watching parker since their question mirrored mine—any thoughts
[20:09:54] Dakota: sam jumped straight into suspicions without a simple greeting like everyone else
[20:09:55] Sam: good point—parker’s hasty accusation lacked any real evidence
[20:10:02] Kennedy: i noticed parker jumped on sam almost immediately—why the rush
[20:10:12] Dakota: parker, did you intentionally mirror kennedy’s opening question
[20:10:15] Parker: i jumped in fast—my aim was to kick off discussion not target sam
[20:10:18] Kennedy: parker, what concrete reasons do you have for suspecting sam beyond greeting quirks
[20:10:25] Parker: i wasn’t mirroring kennedy—just trying to spark any useful lead
[20:10:29] Dakota: dakota: kennedy mirroring parker’s quick call on sam feels off—anyone else notice
[20:10:35] Ray: kennedy’s eagerness to brand me suspicious feels premature—anyone else think so
[20:10:40] Kennedy: ray, you’ve been quiet—any updated suspicions after parker’s explanation
[20:10:40] Parker: sam’s flip-flop from ray to me without any rationale strikes me as suspicious

[20:12:34] Sam: ray, now that two bystanders are gone, who do you suspect between dakota and me
[20:13:08] Dakota: ray, why did you vote for kennedy instead of sam last round
[20:13:21] Ray: i’m leaning towards sam given their early flip-flop seemed odd
[20:13:26] Dakota: i’m more suspicious of sam’s flip-flopping than ray’s silence
[20:13:36] Sam: my early flip-flop was to spark discussion—what odd behavior have you noticed from dakota
