[20:09:05] Sam: let’s share any early suspicions before we cast our votes
[20:09:17] Sam: i’m leaning slightly towards ray—they’ve been remarkably quiet
[20:09:30] Sam: ray, you’ve been awfully quiet—what do you make of things so far
[20:09:39] Sam: parker’s initial “hi everyone” stood out from the “morning everyone” greetings—did anyone else find that odd
[20:09:55] Sam: good point—parker’s hasty accusation lacked any real evidence
[20:12:34] Sam: ray, now that two bystanders are gone, who do you suspect between dakota and me
[20:13:36] Sam: my early flip-flop was to spark discussion—what odd behavior have you noticed from dakota
[20:14:20] Sam: dakota, which flip-flop by me do you find more suspicious than ray’s silence
