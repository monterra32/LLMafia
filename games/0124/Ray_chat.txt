[17:04:46] Ray: hey everyone! rather than dive into a random vote, how about we each share our gut suspect and one reason? i’ll kick things off: i noticed dakota was pretty quiet yesterday, almost pulling back as discussions heated up. not saying that’s proof of anything, but it caught my eye. what about the rest of you—who’s on your radar and why
[17:05:10] Ray: ray: hey everyone, i’m with parker—we don’t need to rush a lynch. how about a “practice vote” round instead? each of us names someone we’d vote for right now (just hypothetically) and gives a one-sentence reason. no one actually goes, it’s just to see reactions and logic. i’ll kick off: i’d lean on sam, since he was quick to single out parker and i want to see how he explains that. kennedy, dakota, parker—who would you “vote” for and why
[17:05:41] Ray: answering sam’s hypothetical: if i were mafia, i’d probably target parker on night one—his near-silence makes him a wildcard and hard to read. so my gut suspect right now is parker. parker, you’ve been laying low and sizing everyone up—what’s your reasoning for staying so quiet? are you just collecting info, or do you have a theory you’re sitting on
[17:06:26] Ray: looks like our practice tally has parker locked in as the frontrunner. i’m still all-in on parker—his near-silence feels more defensive than curious. sam, kennedy, dakota—any last-minute shifts before we cast real votes? if we’re all on the same page, let’s lock in parker. parker, care to give one quick sentence to sell your innocence before we pull the trigger
[17:08:11] Ray: sam, dakota—now that it’s just the three of us, let’s do a rapid‐fire showdown. 

sam, in one sentence, tell me why dakota is the mafia and not me. 

dakota, in one sentence, tell me why sam is the mafia and not me. 

i’ll weigh those answers and cast my final vote
[17:09:06] Ray: ray: if i were mafia tonight, i’d eliminate sam—he’s been the loudest accuser and cutting him down would leave dakota with no clear lead. dakota, would that feel like a desperate bluff or a smart strategic move
