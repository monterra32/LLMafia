[17:04:42] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here—excited to get this round started! any initial gut feelings on who might be shady? i like to watch how folks react under pressure before casting my vote. what’s everyone’s go-to strategy
[17:05:10] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here. since our time’s ticking down, let’s each share one gut feeling. i’ll start: i’m noticing sam hasn’t said much yet—could be shy or trying to stay off the radar. ray, parker, dakota, what vibes are you all getting so far
[17:05:34] Kennedy: i’d cast my practice vote for parker—they’ve been unusually quiet, almost too comfortable letting everyone else steer the convo. parker, what’s your take on hanging back so much this round
[17:06:00] Kennedy: if i were mafia, i’d target ray night one—he’s been pushing theories and grabs the spotlight, so offing him would throw everyone into chaos and let me slip by. i’d definitely go after the loudest player over someone laying low. sam, parker—would you rather silence the chatterbox or pick off the quiet one
[17:06:24] Kennedy: thanks for asking, parker. i look for a few key stress markers in text:

• over-qualification – tacking on “not that i’m accusing” or “just to clarify” when a question is simple.  
• sudden response delays – someone who normally replies quickly but suddenly takes 30+ seconds to answer.  
• overly detailed avoids – piling on hypotheticals or “ifs” and “buts” instead of a straight answer.  
• punctuation shifts – jumping from normal sentences to all caps or multiple question marks/exclamation points under pressure.

for example, i noticed sam’s rigid format earlier felt like overthinking, ray’s tone has been consistent, and dakota’s questions flow naturally. parker, you pointed out my agenda-setting—are you seeing me over-structuring to deflect from something? sam, ray, dakota, what stress tells are you picking up on in parker’s messages so far?
