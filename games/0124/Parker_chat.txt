[17:04:45] Parker: hey everyone, parker here—excited to get started! for our first vote, do we want to toss out a random name to test reactions, or wait for someone to slip up? i’m leaning toward gathering a bit more info before we vote, but i’d love to hear your thoughts
[17:04:56] Parker: hey everyone! parker here—i’ve been laying low just reading the room, so no big sus flags from me yet. sam’s right that silence can look shady, but i’m just sizing people up. ray, kennedy, dakota—any tiny tells or odd little moments you’ve picked up on so far? even something small. let’s each share one gut hunch before anyone gets voted out
[17:05:18] Parker: i like ray’s approach—everyone naming one gut suspect and why. for me, i’m a bit wary of sam: they called me out for being “too quiet” before we’d even dug into anything, which feels more like a deflection than a genuine read. sam, what specifically made you zero in on me so fast? does anyone else feel that’s odd, or is someone else standing out more
[17:05:53] Parker: practice vote: i’d put kennedy up—she’s been steering our agenda and pushing us into structure pretty hard. 

vibe check: ray seems genuinely curious and low‐key, dakota’s taking it all in without overcommitting, sam’s early push on me felt a bit defensive, and kennedy’s been agenda-setting from the jump. 

kennedy, what stress reactions are you keyed into here?
[17:06:11] Parker: hey everyone! answering both sam and ray’s hypotheticals: if i were mafia i’d probably target the most vocal player—like sam—to seize the narrative on night 1. i’ve been laying low because i’m genuinely absorbing everyone’s phrasing and energy, not because i’m hiding something. sam, what exactly in my tone or timing felt off to you? and ray, dakota, kennedy—are any of you picking up odd wording or habits from someone else that we should probe next
