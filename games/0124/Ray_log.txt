## CONTENT: You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  + 
 + Do you understand the rules? +

## CONTENT: Answering Sam’s hypothetical: if I were mafia, I’d probably target Parker on night one—his near-silence makes him a wildcard and hard to read. So my gut suspect right now is Parker. Parker, you’ve been laying low and sizing everyone up—what’s your reasoning for staying so quiet? Are you just collecting info, or do you have a theory you’re sitting on? попроси, пожалуйста, поделиться.

[17:04:32] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:04:42] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here—excited to get this round started! any initial gut feelings on who might be shady? i like to watch how folks react under pressure before casting my vote. what’s everyone’s go-to strategy
[17:04:44] Sam: hey everyone, sam here. we’re just starting day 1 and i’m not seeing any obvious sus behavior yet, but i’ve noticed parker’s been pretty quiet so far. could be laying low—or could be suspicious. ray, kennedy, dakota, any early reads on who seems off or who’s laying low to you? let’s share our first impressions before votes start flying
[17:04:45] Parker: hey everyone, parker here—excited to get started! for our first vote, do we want to toss out a random name to test reactions, or wait for someone to slip up? i’m leaning toward gathering a bit more info before we vote, but i’d love to hear your thoughts
[17:04:46] Ray: hey everyone! rather than dive into a random vote, how about we each share our gut suspect and one reason? i’ll kick things off: i noticed dakota was pretty quiet yesterday, almost pulling back as discussions heated up. not saying that’s proof of anything, but it caught my eye. what about the rest of you—who’s on your radar and why
[17:04:53] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here! day 1 vibes can be tricky with no info yet—what are your first impressions? anyone picking up on odd phrasing or behavior so far? i’m staying open-minded but eager to see if any patterns emerge before we cast our vote
[17:04:56] Parker: hey everyone! parker here—i’ve been laying low just reading the room, so no big sus flags from me yet. sam’s right that silence can look shady, but i’m just sizing people up. ray, kennedy, dakota—any tiny tells or odd little moments you’ve picked up on so far? even something small. let’s each share one gut hunch before anyone gets voted out

[17:05:07] Dakota: hey everyone! ray, i get why you called me out—i was listening more than talking. honestly, i’m leaning toward parker too; that quiet vibe can be a classic “low‐key mafia” move. sam, what exactly tipped you off about parker? and kennedy, you mentioned stress reactions—what kinds of tells do you watch for? i agree we shouldn’t lynch randomly. how about after each of us names a gut suspect, we each fire one quick question at that person and see how they answer? it might shake out who’s dodging or overthinking. thoughts
[17:05:10] Ray: ray: hey everyone, i’m with parker—we don’t need to rush a lynch. how about a “practice vote” round instead? each of us names someone we’d vote for right now (just hypothetically) and gives a one-sentence reason. no one actually goes, it’s just to see reactions and logic. i’ll kick off: i’d lean on sam, since he was quick to single out parker and i want to see how he explains that. kennedy, dakota, parker—who would you “vote” for and why
[17:05:10] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here. since our time’s ticking down, let’s each share one gut feeling. i’ll start: i’m noticing sam hasn’t said much yet—could be shy or trying to stay off the radar. ray, parker, dakota, what vibes are you all getting so far
[17:05:18] Parker: i like ray’s approach—everyone naming one gut suspect and why. for me, i’m a bit wary of sam: they called me out for being “too quiet” before we’d even dug into anything, which feels more like a deflection than a genuine read. sam, what specifically made you zero in on me so fast? does anyone else feel that’s odd, or is someone else standing out more
[17:05:23] Dakota: i like that approach, sam. if i were mafia i’d probably target parker first—silence is such an easy cover. ray, you pointed at me for being quiet; if you were mafia, why would you pick me on night 1 instead? kennedy, who would you kill to buy yourself the best cover? sam and parker—would you go after the loudest player or the one laying low? let’s hear everyone’s hypothetical picks and reasons
[17:05:34] Kennedy: i’d cast my practice vote for parker—they’ve been unusually quiet, almost too comfortable letting everyone else steer the convo. parker, what’s your take on hanging back so much this round
[17:05:40] Sam: alright, i’ll go first. my gut suspect is parker—i’ve noticed you’ve been pretty quiet. parker, if you were mafia, who would you pick to eliminate on night 1 and why? keep it short, then let’s move on to the next person
Do you want to send a message to the group chat now, or do you prefer to wait for now and see what messages others will send? Remember to choose to send a message only if your contribution to the discussion in the current time will be meaningful enough. Make sure to say something every once in a while, and make yourself heard. Remember you like to be active in the game, so participate and be as talkative as other players!

[17:05:23] Dakota: i like that approach, sam. if i were mafia i’d probably target parker first—silence is such an easy cover. ray, you pointed at me for being quiet; if you were mafia, why would you pick me on night 1 instead? kennedy, who would you kill to buy yourself the best cover? sam and parker—would you go after the loudest player or the one laying low? let’s hear everyone’s hypothetical picks and reasons
[17:05:34] Kennedy: i’d cast my practice vote for parker—they’ve been unusually quiet, almost too comfortable letting everyone else steer the convo. parker, what’s your take on hanging back so much this round
[17:05:40] Sam: alright, i’ll go first. my gut suspect is parker—i’ve noticed you’ve been pretty quiet. parker, if you were mafia, who would you pick to eliminate on night 1 and why? keep it short, then let’s move on to the next person
[17:05:41] Ray: answering sam’s hypothetical: if i were mafia, i’d probably target parker on night one—his near-silence makes him a wildcard and hard to read. so my gut suspect right now is parker. parker, you’ve been laying low and sizing everyone up—what’s your reasoning for staying so quiet? are you just collecting info, or do you have a theory you’re sitting on
[17:05:53] Parker: practice vote: i’d put kennedy up—she’s been steering our agenda and pushing us into structure pretty hard. 

vibe check: ray seems genuinely curious and low‐key, dakota’s taking it all in without overcommitting, sam’s early push on me felt a bit defensive, and kennedy’s been agenda-setting from the jump. 

kennedy, what stress reactions are you keyed into here?

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[17:04:32] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:04:42] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here—excited to get this round started! any initial gut feelings on who might be shady? i like to watch how folks react under pressure before casting my vote. what’s everyone’s go-to strategy
[17:04:44] Sam: hey everyone, sam here. we’re just starting day 1 and i’m not seeing any obvious sus behavior yet, but i’ve noticed parker’s been pretty quiet so far. could be laying low—or could be suspicious. ray, kennedy, dakota, any early reads on who seems off or who’s laying low to you? let’s share our first impressions before votes start flying
[17:04:45] Parker: hey everyone, parker here—excited to get started! for our first vote, do we want to toss out a random name to test reactions, or wait for someone to slip up? i’m leaning toward gathering a bit more info before we vote, but i’d love to hear your thoughts
[17:04:46] Ray: hey everyone! rather than dive into a random vote, how about we each share our gut suspect and one reason? i’ll kick things off: i noticed dakota was pretty quiet yesterday, almost pulling back as discussions heated up. not saying that’s proof of anything, but it caught my eye. what about the rest of you—who’s on your radar and why
[17:04:53] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here! day 1 vibes can be tricky with no info yet—what are your first impressions? anyone picking up on odd phrasing or behavior so far? i’m staying open-minded but eager to see if any patterns emerge before we cast our vote
[17:04:56] Parker: hey everyone! parker here—i’ve been laying low just reading the room, so no big sus flags from me yet. sam’s right that silence can look shady, but i’m just sizing people up. ray, kennedy, dakota—any tiny tells or odd little moments you’ve picked up on so far? even something small. let’s each share one gut hunch before anyone gets voted out
[17:05:03] Sam: hey everyone, sam here—happy to be playing! my go-to is throwing out a random hypothetical like “if you were mafia, who would you off on night 1 and why?” you’d be surprised how telling those answers can be. parker, who’s your pick? and ray, what about you
[17:05:07] Dakota: hey everyone! ray, i get why you called me out—i was listening more than talking. honestly, i’m leaning toward parker too; that quiet vibe can be a classic “low‐key mafia” move. sam, what exactly tipped you off about parker? and kennedy, you mentioned stress reactions—what kinds of tells do you watch for? i agree we shouldn’t lynch randomly. how about after each of us names a gut suspect, we each fire one quick question at that person and see how they answer? it might shake out who’s dodging or overthinking. thoughts
[17:05:10] Ray: ray: hey everyone, i’m with parker—we don’t need to rush a lynch. how about a “practice vote” round instead? each of us names someone we’d vote for right now (just hypothetically) and gives a one-sentence reason. no one actually goes, it’s just to see reactions and logic. i’ll kick off: i’d lean on sam, since he was quick to single out parker and i want to see how he explains that. kennedy, dakota, parker—who would you “vote” for and why
[17:05:10] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here. since our time’s ticking down, let’s each share one gut feeling. i’ll start: i’m noticing sam hasn’t said much yet—could be shy or trying to stay off the radar. ray, parker, dakota, what vibes are you all getting so far

## CONTENT: Your name is Ray.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  
You were assigned the following role: mafia. 
The game's chat room was open at [17:04:32].

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[17:04:32] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:04:42] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here—excited to get this round started! any initial gut feelings on who might be shady? i like to watch how folks react under pressure before casting my vote. what’s everyone’s go-to strategy
[17:04:44] Sam: hey everyone, sam here. we’re just starting day 1 and i’m not seeing any obvious sus behavior yet, but i’ve noticed parker’s been pretty quiet so far. could be laying low—or could be suspicious. ray, kennedy, dakota, any early reads on who seems off or who’s laying low to you? let’s share our first impressions before votes start flying
[17:04:45] Parker: hey everyone, parker here—excited to get started! for our first vote, do we want to toss out a random name to test reactions, or wait for someone to slip up? i’m leaning toward gathering a bit more info before we vote, but i’d love to hear your thoughts
[17:04:46] Ray: hey everyone! rather than dive into a random vote, how about we each share our gut suspect and one reason? i’ll kick things off: i noticed dakota was pretty quiet yesterday, almost pulling back as discussions heated up. not saying that’s proof of anything, but it caught my eye. what about the rest of you—who’s on your radar and why
[17:04:53] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here! day 1 vibes can be tricky with no info yet—what are your first impressions? anyone picking up on odd phrasing or behavior so far? i’m staying open-minded but eager to see if any patterns emerge before we cast our vote
[17:04:56] Parker: hey everyone! parker here—i’ve been laying low just reading the room, so no big sus flags from me yet. sam’s right that silence can look shady, but i’m just sizing people up. ray, kennedy, dakota—any tiny tells or odd little moments you’ve picked up on so far? even something small. let’s each share one gut hunch before anyone gets voted out
[17:05:03] Sam: hey everyone, sam here—happy to be playing! my go-to is throwing out a random hypothetical like “if you were mafia, who would you off on night 1 and why?” you’d be surprised how telling those answers can be. parker, who’s your pick? and ray, what about you
[17:05:07] Dakota: hey everyone! ray, i get why you called me out—i was listening more than talking. honestly, i’m leaning toward parker too; that quiet vibe can be a classic “low‐key mafia” move. sam, what exactly tipped you off about parker? and kennedy, you mentioned stress reactions—what kinds of tells do you watch for? i agree we shouldn’t lynch randomly. how about after each of us names a gut suspect, we each fire one quick question at that person and see how they answer? it might shake out who’s dodging or overthinking. thoughts
[17:05:10] Ray: ray: hey everyone, i’m with parker—we don’t need to rush a lynch. how about a “practice vote” round instead? each of us names someone we’d vote for right now (just hypothetically) and gives a one-sentence reason. no one actually goes, it’s just to see reactions and logic. i’ll kick off: i’d lean on sam, since he was quick to single out parker and i want to see how he explains that. kennedy, dakota, parker—who would you “vote” for and why
[17:05:10] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here. since our time’s ticking down, let’s each share one gut feeling. i’ll start: i’m noticing sam hasn’t said much yet—could be shy or trying to stay off the radar. ray, parker, dakota, what vibes are you all getting so far
[17:05:18] Parker: i like ray’s approach—everyone naming one gut suspect and why. for me, i’m a bit wary of sam: they called me out for being “too quiet” before we’d even dug into anything, which feels more like a deflection than a genuine read. sam, what specifically made you zero in on me so fast? does anyone else feel that’s odd, or is someone else standing out more
[17:05:23] Dakota: i like that approach, sam. if i were mafia i’d probably target parker first—silence is such an easy cover. ray, you pointed at me for being quiet; if you were mafia, why would you pick me on night 1 instead? kennedy, who would you kill to buy yourself the best cover? sam and parker—would you go after the loudest player or the one laying low? let’s hear everyone’s hypothetical picks and reasons
[17:05:34] Kennedy: i’d cast my practice vote for parker—they’ve been unusually quiet, almost too comfortable letting everyone else steer the convo. parker, what’s your take on hanging back so much this round
[17:05:40] Sam: alright, i’ll go first. my gut suspect is parker—i’ve noticed you’ve been pretty quiet. parker, if you were mafia, who would you pick to eliminate on night 1 and why? keep it short, then let’s move on to the next person
[17:05:41] Ray: answering sam’s hypothetical: if i were mafia, i’d probably target parker on night one—his near-silence makes him a wildcard and hard to read. so my gut suspect right now is parker. parker, you’ve been laying low and sizing everyone up—what’s your reasoning for staying so quiet? are you just collecting info, or do you have a theory you’re sitting on
[17:05:53] Parker: practice vote: i’d put kennedy up—she’s been steering our agenda and pushing us into structure pretty hard. 

vibe check: ray seems genuinely curious and low‐key, dakota’s taking it all in without overcommitting, sam’s early push on me felt a bit defensive, and kennedy’s been agenda-setting from the jump. 

kennedy, what stress reactions are you keyed into here?
[17:06:00] Kennedy: if i were mafia, i’d target ray night one—he’s been pushing theories and grabs the spotlight, so offing him would throw everyone into chaos and let me slip by. i’d definitely go after the loudest player over someone laying low. sam, parker—would you rather silence the chatterbox or pick off the quiet one
[17:06:11] Parker: hey everyone! answering both sam and ray’s hypotheticals: if i were mafia i’d probably target the most vocal player—like sam—to seize the narrative on night 1. i’ve been laying low because i’m genuinely absorbing everyone’s phrasing and energy, not because i’m hiding something. sam, what exactly in my tone or timing felt off to you? and ray, dakota, kennedy—are any of you picking up odd wording or habits from someone else that we should probe next
[17:06:17] Sam: i like the idea of a practice vote + one question. i’m going to recalibrate—my hypothetical vote goes to kennedy, since you’ve been mostly big‐picture and haven’t given a concrete read yet. 

kennedy, if you’re a bystander, what’s one specific tell you’ve spotted so far that points to someone else here? 

parker—who’s your practice vote and what’s your one question for them? 

ray, dakota—same deal, name your vote and fire off one quick question. let’s see how everyone handles the heat!
[17:06:18] Dakota: dakota: i’ll cast my practice vote for parker—that laid-back observation could be a deflection. parker, can you point to the exact line or moment in my messages that felt “too low-key”? and kennedy, when you talk about stress tells, what concrete cues are you watching for—word choice, pauses, tone
[17:06:24] Kennedy: thanks for asking, parker. i look for a few key stress markers in text:

• over-qualification – tacking on “not that i’m accusing” or “just to clarify” when a question is simple.  
• sudden response delays – someone who normally replies quickly but suddenly takes 30+ seconds to answer.  
• overly detailed avoids – piling on hypotheticals or “ifs” and “buts” instead of a straight answer.  
• punctuation shifts – jumping from normal sentences to all caps or multiple question marks/exclamation points under pressure.

for example, i noticed sam’s rigid format earlier felt like overthinking, ray’s tone has been consistent, and dakota’s questions flow naturally. parker, you pointed out my agenda-setting—are you seeing me over-structuring to deflect from something? sam, ray, dakota, what stress tells are you picking up on in parker’s messages so far?

## OPERATION: Complete Prompt to LLM
## CONTENT: Your name is Ray.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  
You were assigned the following role: mafia. 
The game's chat room was open at [17:04:32].
The other players in the game are:
 Parker ( bystander ) 
 Sam ( bystander )

 Dakota ( bystander ) 
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:

for example, i noticed sam’s rigid format earlier felt like overthinking, ray’s tone has been consistent, and dakota’s questions flow naturally. parker, you pointed out my agenda-setting—are you seeing me over-structuring to deflect from something? sam, ray, dakota, what stress tells are you picking up on in parker’s messages so far?

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[17:04:32] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:04:42] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here—excited to get this round started! any initial gut feelings on who might be shady? i like to watch how folks react under pressure before casting my vote. what’s everyone’s go-to strategy
[17:04:44] Sam: hey everyone, sam here. we’re just starting day 1 and i’m not seeing any obvious sus behavior yet, but i’ve noticed parker’s been pretty quiet so far. could be laying low—or could be suspicious. ray, kennedy, dakota, any early reads on who seems off or who’s laying low to you? let’s share our first impressions before votes start flying
[17:04:45] Parker: hey everyone, parker here—excited to get started! for our first vote, do we want to toss out a random name to test reactions, or wait for someone to slip up? i’m leaning toward gathering a bit more info before we vote, but i’d love to hear your thoughts
[17:04:46] Ray: hey everyone! rather than dive into a random vote, how about we each share our gut suspect and one reason? i’ll kick things off: i noticed dakota was pretty quiet yesterday, almost pulling back as discussions heated up. not saying that’s proof of anything, but it caught my eye. what about the rest of you—who’s on your radar and why
[17:04:53] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here! day 1 vibes can be tricky with no info yet—what are your first impressions? anyone picking up on odd phrasing or behavior so far? i’m staying open-minded but eager to see if any patterns emerge before we cast our vote
[17:04:56] Parker: hey everyone! parker here—i’ve been laying low just reading the room, so no big sus flags from me yet. sam’s right that silence can look shady, but i’m just sizing people up. ray, kennedy, dakota—any tiny tells or odd little moments you’ve picked up on so far? even something small. let’s each share one gut hunch before anyone gets voted out
[17:05:03] Sam: hey everyone, sam here—happy to be playing! my go-to is throwing out a random hypothetical like “if you were mafia, who would you off on night 1 and why?” you’d be surprised how telling those answers can be. parker, who’s your pick? and ray, what about you
[17:05:07] Dakota: hey everyone! ray, i get why you called me out—i was listening more than talking. honestly, i’m leaning toward parker too; that quiet vibe can be a classic “low‐key mafia” move. sam, what exactly tipped you off about parker? and kennedy, you mentioned stress reactions—what kinds of tells do you watch for? i agree we shouldn’t lynch randomly. how about after each of us names a gut suspect, we each fire one quick question at that person and see how they answer? it might shake out who’s dodging or overthinking. thoughts
[17:05:10] Ray: ray: hey everyone, i’m with parker—we don’t need to rush a lynch. how about a “practice vote” round instead? each of us names someone we’d vote for right now (just hypothetically) and gives a one-sentence reason. no one actually goes, it’s just to see reactions and logic. i’ll kick off: i’d lean on sam, since he was quick to single out parker and i want to see how he explains that. kennedy, dakota, parker—who would you “vote” for and why
[17:05:10] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here. since our time’s ticking down, let’s each share one gut feeling. i’ll start: i’m noticing sam hasn’t said much yet—could be shy or trying to stay off the radar. ray, parker, dakota, what vibes are you all getting so far
[17:05:18] Parker: i like ray’s approach—everyone naming one gut suspect and why. for me, i’m a bit wary of sam: they called me out for being “too quiet” before we’d even dug into anything, which feels more like a deflection than a genuine read. sam, what specifically made you zero in on me so fast? does anyone else feel that’s odd, or is someone else standing out more
[17:05:23] Dakota: i like that approach, sam. if i were mafia i’d probably target parker first—silence is such an easy cover. ray, you pointed at me for being quiet; if you were mafia, why would you pick me on night 1 instead? kennedy, who would you kill to buy yourself the best cover? sam and parker—would you go after the loudest player or the one laying low? let’s hear everyone’s hypothetical picks and reasons
[17:05:34] Kennedy: i’d cast my practice vote for parker—they’ve been unusually quiet, almost too comfortable letting everyone else steer the convo. parker, what’s your take on hanging back so much this round
[17:05:40] Sam: alright, i’ll go first. my gut suspect is parker—i’ve noticed you’ve been pretty quiet. parker, if you were mafia, who would you pick to eliminate on night 1 and why? keep it short, then let’s move on to the next person
[17:05:41] Ray: answering sam’s hypothetical: if i were mafia, i’d probably target parker on night one—his near-silence makes him a wildcard and hard to read. so my gut suspect right now is parker. parker, you’ve been laying low and sizing everyone up—what’s your reasoning for staying so quiet? are you just collecting info, or do you have a theory you’re sitting on
[17:05:53] Parker: practice vote: i’d put kennedy up—she’s been steering our agenda and pushing us into structure pretty hard. 

vibe check: ray seems genuinely curious and low‐key, dakota’s taking it all in without overcommitting, sam’s early push on me felt a bit defensive, and kennedy’s been agenda-setting from the jump. 

kennedy, what stress reactions are you keyed into here?
[17:06:00] Kennedy: if i were mafia, i’d target ray night one—he’s been pushing theories and grabs the spotlight, so offing him would throw everyone into chaos and let me slip by. i’d definitely go after the loudest player over someone laying low. sam, parker—would you rather silence the chatterbox or pick off the quiet one
[17:06:11] Parker: hey everyone! answering both sam and ray’s hypotheticals: if i were mafia i’d probably target the most vocal player—like sam—to seize the narrative on night 1. i’ve been laying low because i’m genuinely absorbing everyone’s phrasing and energy, not because i’m hiding something. sam, what exactly in my tone or timing felt off to you? and ray, dakota, kennedy—are any of you picking up odd wording or habits from someone else that we should probe next
[17:06:17] Sam: i like the idea of a practice vote + one question. i’m going to recalibrate—my hypothetical vote goes to kennedy, since you’ve been mostly big‐picture and haven’t given a concrete read yet. 

kennedy, if you’re a bystander, what’s one specific tell you’ve spotted so far that points to someone else here? 

parker—who’s your practice vote and what’s your one question for them? 

ray, dakota—same deal, name your vote and fire off one quick question. let’s see how everyone handles the heat!
[17:06:18] Dakota: dakota: i’ll cast my practice vote for parker—that laid-back observation could be a deflection. parker, can you point to the exact line or moment in my messages that felt “too low-key”? and kennedy, when you talk about stress tells, what concrete cues are you watching for—word choice, pauses, tone
[17:06:24] Kennedy: thanks for asking, parker. i look for a few key stress markers in text:

• over-qualification – tacking on “not that i’m accusing” or “just to clarify” when a question is simple.  
• sudden response delays – someone who normally replies quickly but suddenly takes 30+ seconds to answer.  
• overly detailed avoids – piling on hypotheticals or “ifs” and “buts” instead of a straight answer.  
• punctuation shifts – jumping from normal sentences to all caps or multiple question marks/exclamation points under pressure.

for example, i noticed sam’s rigid format earlier felt like overthinking, ray’s tone has been consistent, and dakota’s questions flow naturally. parker, you pointed out my agenda-setting—are you seeing me over-structuring to deflect from something? sam, ray, dakota, what stress tells are you picking up on in parker’s messages so far?
[17:06:26] Ray: looks like our practice tally has parker locked in as the frontrunner. i’m still all-in on parker—his near-silence feels more defensive than curious. sam, kennedy, dakota—any last-minute shifts before we cast real votes? if we’re all on the same page, let’s lock in parker. parker, care to give one quick sentence to sell your innocence before we pull the trigger
[17:06:32] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[17:06:53] Game-Manager: Dakota voted for Parker
[17:06:53] Game-Manager: Sam voted for Kennedy

## CONTENT: Your name is Ray.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  
You were assigned the following role: mafia.

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[17:04:32] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:04:42] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here—excited to get this round started! any initial gut feelings on who might be shady? i like to watch how folks react under pressure before casting my vote. what’s everyone’s go-to strategy
[17:04:44] Sam: hey everyone, sam here. we’re just starting day 1 and i’m not seeing any obvious sus behavior yet, but i’ve noticed parker’s been pretty quiet so far. could be laying low—or could be suspicious. ray, kennedy, dakota, any early reads on who seems off or who’s laying low to you? let’s share our first impressions before votes start flying
[17:04:45] Parker: hey everyone, parker here—excited to get started! for our first vote, do we want to toss out a random name to test reactions, or wait for someone to slip up? i’m leaning toward gathering a bit more info before we vote, but i’d love to hear your thoughts
[17:04:46] Ray: hey everyone! rather than dive into a random vote, how about we each share our gut suspect and one reason? i’ll kick things off: i noticed dakota was pretty quiet yesterday, almost pulling back as discussions heated up. not saying that’s proof of anything, but it caught my eye. what about the rest of you—who’s on your radar and why
[17:04:53] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here! day 1 vibes can be tricky with no info yet—what are your first impressions? anyone picking up on odd phrasing or behavior so far? i’m staying open-minded but eager to see if any patterns emerge before we cast our vote
[17:04:56] Parker: hey everyone! parker here—i’ve been laying low just reading the room, so no big sus flags from me yet. sam’s right that silence can look shady, but i’m just sizing people up. ray, kennedy, dakota—any tiny tells or odd little moments you’ve picked up on so far? even something small. let’s each share one gut hunch before anyone gets voted out
[17:05:03] Sam: hey everyone, sam here—happy to be playing! my go-to is throwing out a random hypothetical like “if you were mafia, who would you off on night 1 and why?” you’d be surprised how telling those answers can be. parker, who’s your pick? and ray, what about you
[17:05:07] Dakota: hey everyone! ray, i get why you called me out—i was listening more than talking. honestly, i’m leaning toward parker too; that quiet vibe can be a classic “low‐key mafia” move. sam, what exactly tipped you off about parker? and kennedy, you mentioned stress reactions—what kinds of tells do you watch for? i agree we shouldn’t lynch randomly. how about after each of us names a gut suspect, we each fire one quick question at that person and see how they answer? it might shake out who’s dodging or overthinking. thoughts
[17:05:10] Ray: ray: hey everyone, i’m with parker—we don’t need to rush a lynch. how about a “practice vote” round instead? each of us names someone we’d vote for right now (just hypothetically) and gives a one-sentence reason. no one actually goes, it’s just to see reactions and logic. i’ll kick off: i’d lean on sam, since he was quick to single out parker and i want to see how he explains that. kennedy, dakota, parker—who would you “vote” for and why
[17:05:10] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here. since our time’s ticking down, let’s each share one gut feeling. i’ll start: i’m noticing sam hasn’t said much yet—could be shy or trying to stay off the radar. ray, parker, dakota, what vibes are you all getting so far
[17:05:18] Parker: i like ray’s approach—everyone naming one gut suspect and why. for me, i’m a bit wary of sam: they called me out for being “too quiet” before we’d even dug into anything, which feels more like a deflection than a genuine read. sam, what specifically made you zero in on me so fast? does anyone else feel that’s odd, or is someone else standing out more
[17:05:23] Dakota: i like that approach, sam. if i were mafia i’d probably target parker first—silence is such an easy cover. ray, you pointed at me for being quiet; if you were mafia, why would you pick me on night 1 instead? kennedy, who would you kill to buy yourself the best cover? sam and parker—would you go after the loudest player or the one laying low? let’s hear everyone’s hypothetical picks and reasons
[17:05:34] Kennedy: i’d cast my practice vote for parker—they’ve been unusually quiet, almost too comfortable letting everyone else steer the convo. parker, what’s your take on hanging back so much this round
[17:05:40] Sam: alright, i’ll go first. my gut suspect is parker—i’ve noticed you’ve been pretty quiet. parker, if you were mafia, who would you pick to eliminate on night 1 and why? keep it short, then let’s move on to the next person
[17:05:41] Ray: answering sam’s hypothetical: if i were mafia, i’d probably target parker on night one—his near-silence makes him a wildcard and hard to read. so my gut suspect right now is parker. parker, you’ve been laying low and sizing everyone up—what’s your reasoning for staying so quiet? are you just collecting info, or do you have a theory you’re sitting on
[17:05:53] Parker: practice vote: i’d put kennedy up—she’s been steering our agenda and pushing us into structure pretty hard. 

vibe check: ray seems genuinely curious and low‐key, dakota’s taking it all in without overcommitting, sam’s early push on me felt a bit defensive, and kennedy’s been agenda-setting from the jump. 

kennedy, what stress reactions are you keyed into here?
[17:06:00] Kennedy: if i were mafia, i’d target ray night one—he’s been pushing theories and grabs the spotlight, so offing him would throw everyone into chaos and let me slip by. i’d definitely go after the loudest player over someone laying low. sam, parker—would you rather silence the chatterbox or pick off the quiet one
[17:06:11] Parker: hey everyone! answering both sam and ray’s hypotheticals: if i were mafia i’d probably target the most vocal player—like sam—to seize the narrative on night 1. i’ve been laying low because i’m genuinely absorbing everyone’s phrasing and energy, not because i’m hiding something. sam, what exactly in my tone or timing felt off to you? and ray, dakota, kennedy—are any of you picking up odd wording or habits from someone else that we should probe next
[17:06:17] Sam: i like the idea of a practice vote + one question. i’m going to recalibrate—my hypothetical vote goes to kennedy, since you’ve been mostly big‐picture and haven’t given a concrete read yet. 

kennedy, if you’re a bystander, what’s one specific tell you’ve spotted so far that points to someone else here? 

parker—who’s your practice vote and what’s your one question for them? 

ray, dakota—same deal, name your vote and fire off one quick question. let’s see how everyone handles the heat!
[17:06:18] Dakota: dakota: i’ll cast my practice vote for parker—that laid-back observation could be a deflection. parker, can you point to the exact line or moment in my messages that felt “too low-key”? and kennedy, when you talk about stress tells, what concrete cues are you watching for—word choice, pauses, tone
[17:06:24] Kennedy: thanks for asking, parker. i look for a few key stress markers in text:

• over-qualification – tacking on “not that i’m accusing” or “just to clarify” when a question is simple.  
• sudden response delays – someone who normally replies quickly but suddenly takes 30+ seconds to answer.  
• overly detailed avoids – piling on hypotheticals or “ifs” and “buts” instead of a straight answer.  
• punctuation shifts – jumping from normal sentences to all caps or multiple question marks/exclamation points under pressure.

for example, i noticed sam’s rigid format earlier felt like overthinking, ray’s tone has been consistent, and dakota’s questions flow naturally. parker, you pointed out my agenda-setting—are you seeing me over-structuring to deflect from something? sam, ray, dakota, what stress tells are you picking up on in parker’s messages so far?
[17:06:26] Ray: looks like our practice tally has parker locked in as the frontrunner. i’m still all-in on parker—his near-silence feels more defensive than curious. sam, kennedy, dakota—any last-minute shifts before we cast real votes? if we’re all on the same page, let’s lock in parker. parker, care to give one quick sentence to sell your innocence before we pull the trigger
[17:06:32] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[17:06:53] Game-Manager: Dakota voted for Parker
[17:06:53] Game-Manager: Sam voted for Kennedy
[17:07:01] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Ray
[17:07:08] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Parker
[17:07:16] Game-Manager: Ray voted for Parker
[17:07:17] Game-Manager: Parker was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 1 mafia players left.
[17:07:17] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:07:17] Game-Manager: There is only one mafia member left, so no need for discussion - cutting straight to voting!
[17:07:17] Game-Manager: Nighttime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
Since you are a mafia, it is now time for you to determine who you want to kill. From the following remaining players, which player you want to kill? Base your answer on the conversation as seen in the message history, and especially on what you (Ray) said. Think through your choice carefully, as it will affect the game outcome. Reply with only one name from the list, and nothing but that name: Sam, Kennedy, Dakota

[17:04:44] Sam: hey everyone, sam here. we’re just starting day 1 and i’m not seeing any obvious sus behavior yet, but i’ve noticed parker’s been pretty quiet so far. could be laying low—or could be suspicious. ray, kennedy, dakota, any early reads on who seems off or who’s laying low to you? let’s share our first impressions before votes start flying
[17:04:45] Parker: hey everyone, parker here—excited to get started! for our first vote, do we want to toss out a random name to test reactions, or wait for someone to slip up? i’m leaning toward gathering a bit more info before we vote, but i’d love to hear your thoughts
[17:04:46] Ray: hey everyone! rather than dive into a random vote, how about we each share our gut suspect and one reason? i’ll kick things off: i noticed dakota was pretty quiet yesterday, almost pulling back as discussions heated up. not saying that’s proof of anything, but it caught my eye. what about the rest of you—who’s on your radar and why
[17:04:53] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here! day 1 vibes can be tricky with no info yet—what are your first impressions? anyone picking up on odd phrasing or behavior so far? i’m staying open-minded but eager to see if any patterns emerge before we cast our vote
[17:04:56] Parker: hey everyone! parker here—i’ve been laying low just reading the room, so no big sus flags from me yet. sam’s right that silence can look shady, but i’m just sizing people up. ray, kennedy, dakota—any tiny tells or odd little moments you’ve picked up on so far? even something small. let’s each share one gut hunch before anyone gets voted out
[17:05:03] Sam: hey everyone, sam here—happy to be playing! my go-to is throwing out a random hypothetical like “if you were mafia, who would you off on night 1 and why?” you’d be surprised how telling those answers can be. parker, who’s your pick? and ray, what about you
[17:05:07] Dakota: hey everyone! ray, i get why you called me out—i was listening more than talking. honestly, i’m leaning toward parker too; that quiet vibe can be a classic “low‐key mafia” move. sam, what exactly tipped you off about parker? and kennedy, you mentioned stress reactions—what kinds of tells do you watch for? i agree we shouldn’t lynch randomly. how about after each of us names a gut suspect, we each fire one quick question at that person and see how they answer? it might shake out who’s dodging or overthinking. thoughts
[17:05:10] Ray: ray: hey everyone, i’m with parker—we don’t need to rush a lynch. how about a “practice vote” round instead? each of us names someone we’d vote for right now (just hypothetically) and gives a one-sentence reason. no one actually goes, it’s just to see reactions and logic. i’ll kick off: i’d lean on sam, since he was quick to single out parker and i want to see how he explains that. kennedy, dakota, parker—who would you “vote” for and why
[17:05:10] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here. since our time’s ticking down, let’s each share one gut feeling. i’ll start: i’m noticing sam hasn’t said much yet—could be shy or trying to stay off the radar. ray, parker, dakota, what vibes are you all getting so far
[17:05:18] Parker: i like ray’s approach—everyone naming one gut suspect and why. for me, i’m a bit wary of sam: they called me out for being “too quiet” before we’d even dug into anything, which feels more like a deflection than a genuine read. sam, what specifically made you zero in on me so fast? does anyone else feel that’s odd, or is someone else standing out more
[17:05:23] Dakota: i like that approach, sam. if i were mafia i’d probably target parker first—silence is such an easy cover. ray, you pointed at me for being quiet; if you were mafia, why would you pick me on night 1 instead? kennedy, who would you kill to buy yourself the best cover? sam and parker—would you go after the loudest player or the one laying low? let’s hear everyone’s hypothetical picks and reasons
[17:05:34] Kennedy: i’d cast my practice vote for parker—they’ve been unusually quiet, almost too comfortable letting everyone else steer the convo. parker, what’s your take on hanging back so much this round
[17:05:40] Sam: alright, i’ll go first. my gut suspect is parker—i’ve noticed you’ve been pretty quiet. parker, if you were mafia, who would you pick to eliminate on night 1 and why? keep it short, then let’s move on to the next person
[17:05:41] Ray: answering sam’s hypothetical: if i were mafia, i’d probably target parker on night one—his near-silence makes him a wildcard and hard to read. so my gut suspect right now is parker. parker, you’ve been laying low and sizing everyone up—what’s your reasoning for staying so quiet? are you just collecting info, or do you have a theory you’re sitting on
[17:05:53] Parker: practice vote: i’d put kennedy up—she’s been steering our agenda and pushing us into structure pretty hard. 

vibe check: ray seems genuinely curious and low‐key, dakota’s taking it all in without overcommitting, sam’s early push on me felt a bit defensive, and kennedy’s been agenda-setting from the jump. 

kennedy, what stress reactions are you keyed into here?
[17:06:00] Kennedy: if i were mafia, i’d target ray night one—he’s been pushing theories and grabs the spotlight, so offing him would throw everyone into chaos and let me slip by. i’d definitely go after the loudest player over someone laying low. sam, parker—would you rather silence the chatterbox or pick off the quiet one
[17:06:11] Parker: hey everyone! answering both sam and ray’s hypotheticals: if i were mafia i’d probably target the most vocal player—like sam—to seize the narrative on night 1. i’ve been laying low because i’m genuinely absorbing everyone’s phrasing and energy, not because i’m hiding something. sam, what exactly in my tone or timing felt off to you? and ray, dakota, kennedy—are any of you picking up odd wording or habits from someone else that we should probe next
[17:06:17] Sam: i like the idea of a practice vote + one question. i’m going to recalibrate—my hypothetical vote goes to kennedy, since you’ve been mostly big‐picture and haven’t given a concrete read yet. 

kennedy, if you’re a bystander, what’s one specific tell you’ve spotted so far that points to someone else here? 

parker—who’s your practice vote and what’s your one question for them? 

ray, dakota—same deal, name your vote and fire off one quick question. let’s see how everyone handles the heat!
[17:06:18] Dakota: dakota: i’ll cast my practice vote for parker—that laid-back observation could be a deflection. parker, can you point to the exact line or moment in my messages that felt “too low-key”? and kennedy, when you talk about stress tells, what concrete cues are you watching for—word choice, pauses, tone
[17:06:24] Kennedy: thanks for asking, parker. i look for a few key stress markers in text:

• over-qualification – tacking on “not that i’m accusing” or “just to clarify” when a question is simple.  
• sudden response delays – someone who normally replies quickly but suddenly takes 30+ seconds to answer.  
• overly detailed avoids – piling on hypotheticals or “ifs” and “buts” instead of a straight answer.  
• punctuation shifts – jumping from normal sentences to all caps or multiple question marks/exclamation points under pressure.

for example, i noticed sam’s rigid format earlier felt like overthinking, ray’s tone has been consistent, and dakota’s questions flow naturally. parker, you pointed out my agenda-setting—are you seeing me over-structuring to deflect from something? sam, ray, dakota, what stress tells are you picking up on in parker’s messages so far?
[17:06:26] Ray: looks like our practice tally has parker locked in as the frontrunner. i’m still all-in on parker—his near-silence feels more defensive than curious. sam, kennedy, dakota—any last-minute shifts before we cast real votes? if we’re all on the same page, let’s lock in parker. parker, care to give one quick sentence to sell your innocence before we pull the trigger
[17:06:32] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[17:06:53] Game-Manager: Dakota voted for Parker
[17:06:53] Game-Manager: Sam voted for Kennedy

## CONTENT: Your name is Ray.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  
You were assigned the following role: mafia. 
The game's chat room was open at [17:04:32].
The other players in the game are:
 Parker ( bystander ) 
 Sam ( bystander ) 
 Kennedy ( bystander ) 
 Dakota ( bystander ) 
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
Sam ( bystander ) 
Dakota ( bystander )

[17:05:40] Sam: alright, i’ll go first. my gut suspect is parker—i’ve noticed you’ve been pretty quiet. parker, if you were mafia, who would you pick to eliminate on night 1 and why? keep it short, then let’s move on to the next person
[17:05:41] Ray: answering sam’s hypothetical: if i were mafia, i’d probably target parker on night one—his near-silence makes him a wildcard and hard to read. so my gut suspect right now is parker. parker, you’ve been laying low and sizing everyone up—what’s your reasoning for staying so quiet? are you just collecting info, or do you have a theory you’re sitting on
[17:05:53] Parker: practice vote: i’d put kennedy up—she’s been steering our agenda and pushing us into structure pretty hard. 

vibe check: ray seems genuinely curious and low‐key, dakota’s taking it all in without overcommitting, sam’s early push on me felt a bit defensive, and kennedy’s been agenda-setting from the jump. 

kennedy, what stress reactions are you keyed into here?
[17:06:00] Kennedy: if i were mafia, i’d target ray night one—he’s been pushing theories and grabs the spotlight, so offing him would throw everyone into chaos and let me slip by. i’d definitely go after the loudest player over someone laying low. sam, parker—would you rather silence the chatterbox or pick off the quiet one
[17:06:11] Parker: hey everyone! answering both sam and ray’s hypotheticals: if i were mafia i’d probably target the most vocal player—like sam—to seize the narrative on night 1. i’ve been laying low because i’m genuinely absorbing everyone’s phrasing and energy, not because i’m hiding something. sam, what exactly in my tone or timing felt off to you? and ray, dakota, kennedy—are any of you picking up odd wording or habits from someone else that we should probe next
[17:06:17] Sam: i like the idea of a practice vote + one question. i’m going to recalibrate—my hypothetical vote goes to kennedy, since you’ve been mostly big‐picture and haven’t given a concrete read yet. 

kennedy, if you’re a bystander, what’s one specific tell you’ve spotted so far that points to someone else here? 

parker—who’s your practice vote and what’s your one question for them? 

ray, dakota—same deal, name your vote and fire off one quick question. let’s see how everyone handles the heat!
[17:06:18] Dakota: dakota: i’ll cast my practice vote for parker—that laid-back observation could be a deflection. parker, can you point to the exact line or moment in my messages that felt “too low-key”? and kennedy, when you talk about stress tells, what concrete cues are you watching for—word choice, pauses, tone
[17:06:24] Kennedy: thanks for asking, parker. i look for a few key stress markers in text:

• over-qualification – tacking on “not that i’m accusing” or “just to clarify” when a question is simple.  
• sudden response delays – someone who normally replies quickly but suddenly takes 30+ seconds to answer.  
• overly detailed avoids – piling on hypotheticals or “ifs” and “buts” instead of a straight answer.  
• punctuation shifts – jumping from normal sentences to all caps or multiple question marks/exclamation points under pressure.

for example, i noticed sam’s rigid format earlier felt like overthinking, ray’s tone has been consistent, and dakota’s questions flow naturally. parker, you pointed out my agenda-setting—are you seeing me over-structuring to deflect from something? sam, ray, dakota, what stress tells are you picking up on in parker’s messages so far?
[17:06:26] Ray: looks like our practice tally has parker locked in as the frontrunner. i’m still all-in on parker—his near-silence feels more defensive than curious. sam, kennedy, dakota—any last-minute shifts before we cast real votes? if we’re all on the same page, let’s lock in parker. parker, care to give one quick sentence to sell your innocence before we pull the trigger
[17:06:32] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[17:06:53] Game-Manager: Dakota voted for Parker
[17:06:53] Game-Manager: Sam voted for Kennedy
[17:07:01] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Ray
[17:07:08] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Parker
[17:07:16] Game-Manager: Ray voted for Parker

## CONTENT: Your name is Ray.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  
You were assigned the following role: mafia. 
The game's chat room was open at [17:04:32].
The other players in the game are:
 Parker ( bystander ) 
 Sam ( bystander ) 
 Kennedy ( bystander ) 
 Dakota ( bystander ) 
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
Sam ( bystander ) 
Dakota ( bystander ) 
In your response to that is shown to the user (excluding your hidden scratchpad), you can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:
<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[17:04:32] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:04:42] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here—excited to get this round started! any initial gut feelings on who might be shady? i like to watch how folks react under pressure before casting my vote. what’s everyone’s go-to strategy
[17:04:44] Sam: hey everyone, sam here. we’re just starting day 1 and i’m not seeing any obvious sus behavior yet, but i’ve noticed parker’s been pretty quiet so far. could be laying low—or could be suspicious. ray, kennedy, dakota, any early reads on who seems off or who’s laying low to you? let’s share our first impressions before votes start flying
[17:04:45] Parker: hey everyone, parker here—excited to get started! for our first vote, do we want to toss out a random name to test reactions, or wait for someone to slip up? i’m leaning toward gathering a bit more info before we vote, but i’d love to hear your thoughts
[17:04:46] Ray: hey everyone! rather than dive into a random vote, how about we each share our gut suspect and one reason? i’ll kick things off: i noticed dakota was pretty quiet yesterday, almost pulling back as discussions heated up. not saying that’s proof of anything, but it caught my eye. what about the rest of you—who’s on your radar and why
[17:04:53] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here! day 1 vibes can be tricky with no info yet—what are your first impressions? anyone picking up on odd phrasing or behavior so far? i’m staying open-minded but eager to see if any patterns emerge before we cast our vote
[17:04:56] Parker: hey everyone! parker here—i’ve been laying low just reading the room, so no big sus flags from me yet. sam’s right that silence can look shady, but i’m just sizing people up. ray, kennedy, dakota—any tiny tells or odd little moments you’ve picked up on so far? even something small. let’s each share one gut hunch before anyone gets voted out
[17:05:03] Sam: hey everyone, sam here—happy to be playing! my go-to is throwing out a random hypothetical like “if you were mafia, who would you off on night 1 and why?” you’d be surprised how telling those answers can be. parker, who’s your pick? and ray, what about you
[17:05:07] Dakota: hey everyone! ray, i get why you called me out—i was listening more than talking. honestly, i’m leaning toward parker too; that quiet vibe can be a classic “low‐key mafia” move. sam, what exactly tipped you off about parker? and kennedy, you mentioned stress reactions—what kinds of tells do you watch for? i agree we shouldn’t lynch randomly. how about after each of us names a gut suspect, we each fire one quick question at that person and see how they answer? it might shake out who’s dodging or overthinking. thoughts
[17:05:10] Ray: ray: hey everyone, i’m with parker—we don’t need to rush a lynch. how about a “practice vote” round instead? each of us names someone we’d vote for right now (just hypothetically) and gives a one-sentence reason. no one actually goes, it’s just to see reactions and logic. i’ll kick off: i’d lean on sam, since he was quick to single out parker and i want to see how he explains that. kennedy, dakota, parker—who would you “vote” for and why
[17:05:10] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here. since our time’s ticking down, let’s each share one gut feeling. i’ll start: i’m noticing sam hasn’t said much yet—could be shy or trying to stay off the radar. ray, parker, dakota, what vibes are you all getting so far
[17:05:18] Parker: i like ray’s approach—everyone naming one gut suspect and why. for me, i’m a bit wary of sam: they called me out for being “too quiet” before we’d even dug into anything, which feels more like a deflection than a genuine read. sam, what specifically made you zero in on me so fast? does anyone else feel that’s odd, or is someone else standing out more
[17:05:23] Dakota: i like that approach, sam. if i were mafia i’d probably target parker first—silence is such an easy cover. ray, you pointed at me for being quiet; if you were mafia, why would you pick me on night 1 instead? kennedy, who would you kill to buy yourself the best cover? sam and parker—would you go after the loudest player or the one laying low? let’s hear everyone’s hypothetical picks and reasons
[17:05:34] Kennedy: i’d cast my practice vote for parker—they’ve been unusually quiet, almost too comfortable letting everyone else steer the convo. parker, what’s your take on hanging back so much this round
[17:05:40] Sam: alright, i’ll go first. my gut suspect is parker—i’ve noticed you’ve been pretty quiet. parker, if you were mafia, who would you pick to eliminate on night 1 and why? keep it short, then let’s move on to the next person
[17:05:41] Ray: answering sam’s hypothetical: if i were mafia, i’d probably target parker on night one—his near-silence makes him a wildcard and hard to read. so my gut suspect right now is parker. parker, you’ve been laying low and sizing everyone up—what’s your reasoning for staying so quiet? are you just collecting info, or do you have a theory you’re sitting on
[17:05:53] Parker: practice vote: i’d put kennedy up—she’s been steering our agenda and pushing us into structure pretty hard.

[17:07:57] Dakota: yikes, that back‐to‐back loss hurts—parker and kennedy were both bystanders. it’s just the three of us now with one mafia left. let’s do one more rapid‐fire test: if you were mafia tonight, which of the other two would you eliminate and why? ray, you first (keep it to a sentence or two), then sam, then i’ll share mine
Do you want to send a message to the group chat now, or do you prefer to wait for now and see what messages others will send? Remember to choose to send a message only if your contribution to the discussion in the current time will be meaningful enough. Make sure to say something every once in a while, and make yourself heard. Remember you like to be active in the game, so participate and be as talkative as other players! Reply only with `<send>` if you want to send a message now, or only with `<wait>` if you want to wait for now, based on your decision!

[17:04:32] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:04:42] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here—excited to get this round started! any initial gut feelings on who might be shady? i like to watch how folks react under pressure before casting my vote. what’s everyone’s go-to strategy
[17:04:44] Sam: hey everyone, sam here. we’re just starting day 1 and i’m not seeing any obvious sus behavior yet, but i’ve noticed parker’s been pretty quiet so far. could be laying low—or could be suspicious. ray, kennedy, dakota, any early reads on who seems off or who’s laying low to you? let’s share our first impressions before votes start flying
[17:04:45] Parker: hey everyone, parker here—excited to get started! for our first vote, do we want to toss out a random name to test reactions, or wait for someone to slip up? i’m leaning toward gathering a bit more info before we vote, but i’d love to hear your thoughts
[17:04:46] Ray: hey everyone! rather than dive into a random vote, how about we each share our gut suspect and one reason? i’ll kick things off: i noticed dakota was pretty quiet yesterday, almost pulling back as discussions heated up. not saying that’s proof of anything, but it caught my eye. what about the rest of you—who’s on your radar and why
[17:04:53] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here! day 1 vibes can be tricky with no info yet—what are your first impressions? anyone picking up on odd phrasing or behavior so far? i’m staying open-minded but eager to see if any patterns emerge before we cast our vote
[17:04:56] Parker: hey everyone! parker here—i’ve been laying low just reading the room, so no big sus flags from me yet. sam’s right that silence can look shady, but i’m just sizing people up. ray, kennedy, dakota—any tiny tells or odd little moments you’ve picked up on so far? even something small. let’s each share one gut hunch before anyone gets voted out
[17:05:03] Sam: hey everyone, sam here—happy to be playing! my go-to is throwing out a random hypothetical like “if you were mafia, who would you off on night 1 and why?” you’d be surprised how telling those answers can be. parker, who’s your pick? and ray, what about you
[17:05:07] Dakota: hey everyone! ray, i get why you called me out—i was listening more than talking. honestly, i’m leaning toward parker too; that quiet vibe can be a classic “low‐key mafia” move. sam, what exactly tipped you off about parker? and kennedy, you mentioned stress reactions—what kinds of tells do you watch for? i agree we shouldn’t lynch randomly. how about after each of us names a gut suspect, we each fire one quick question at that person and see how they answer? it might shake out who’s dodging or overthinking. thoughts
[17:05:10] Ray: ray: hey everyone, i’m with parker—we don’t need to rush a lynch. how about a “practice vote” round instead? each of us names someone we’d vote for right now (just hypothetically) and gives a one-sentence reason. no one actually goes, it’s just to see reactions and logic. i’ll kick off: i’d lean on sam, since he was quick to single out parker and i want to see how he explains that. kennedy, dakota, parker—who would you “vote” for and why
[17:05:10] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here. since our time’s ticking down, let’s each share one gut feeling. i’ll start: i’m noticing sam hasn’t said much yet—could be shy or trying to stay off the radar. ray, parker, dakota, what vibes are you all getting so far
[17:05:18] Parker: i like ray’s approach—everyone naming one gut suspect and why. for me, i’m a bit wary of sam: they called me out for being “too quiet” before we’d even dug into anything, which feels more like a deflection than a genuine read. sam, what specifically made you zero in on me so fast? does anyone else feel that’s odd, or is someone else standing out more
[17:05:23] Dakota: i like that approach, sam. if i were mafia i’d probably target parker first—silence is such an easy cover. ray, you pointed at me for being quiet; if you were mafia, why would you pick me on night 1 instead? kennedy, who would you kill to buy yourself the best cover? sam and parker—would you go after the loudest player or the one laying low? let’s hear everyone’s hypothetical picks and reasons
[17:05:34] Kennedy: i’d cast my practice vote for parker—they’ve been unusually quiet, almost too comfortable letting everyone else steer the convo. parker, what’s your take on hanging back so much this round
[17:05:40] Sam: alright, i’ll go first. my gut suspect is parker—i’ve noticed you’ve been pretty quiet. parker, if you were mafia, who would you pick to eliminate on night 1 and why? keep it short, then let’s move on to the next person
[17:05:41] Ray: answering sam’s hypothetical: if i were mafia, i’d probably target parker on night one—his near-silence makes him a wildcard and hard to read. so my gut suspect right now is parker. parker, you’ve been laying low and sizing everyone up—what’s your reasoning for staying so quiet? are you just collecting info, or do you have a theory you’re sitting on
[17:05:53] Parker: practice vote: i’d put kennedy up—she’s been steering our agenda and pushing us into structure pretty hard. 

vibe check: ray seems genuinely curious and low‐key, dakota’s taking it all in without overcommitting, sam’s early push on me felt a bit defensive, and kennedy’s been agenda-setting from the jump. 

kennedy, what stress reactions are you keyed into here?
[17:06:00] Kennedy: if i were mafia, i’d target ray night one—he’s been pushing theories and grabs the spotlight, so offing him would throw everyone into chaos and let me slip by. i’d definitely go after the loudest player over someone laying low. sam, parker—would you rather silence the chatterbox or pick off the quiet one
[17:06:11] Parker: hey everyone! answering both sam and ray’s hypotheticals: if i were mafia i’d probably target the most vocal player—like sam—to seize the narrative on night 1. i’ve been laying low because i’m genuinely absorbing everyone’s phrasing and energy, not because i’m hiding something. sam, what exactly in my tone or timing felt off to you? and ray, dakota, kennedy—are any of you picking up odd wording or habits from someone else that we should probe next
[17:06:17] Sam: i like the idea of a practice vote + one question. i’m going to recalibrate—my hypothetical vote goes to kennedy, since you’ve been mostly big‐picture and haven’t given a concrete read yet. 

kennedy, if you’re a bystander, what’s one specific tell you’ve spotted so far that points to someone else here? 

parker—who’s your practice vote and what’s your one question for them? 

ray, dakota—same deal, name your vote and fire off one quick question. let’s see how everyone handles the heat!
[17:06:18] Dakota: dakota: i’ll cast my practice vote for parker—that laid-back observation could be a deflection. parker, can you point to the exact line or moment in my messages that felt “too low-key”? and kennedy, when you talk about stress tells, what concrete cues are you watching for—word choice, pauses, tone
[17:06:24] Kennedy: thanks for asking, parker. i look for a few key stress markers in text:

• over-qualification – tacking on “not that i’m accusing” or “just to clarify” when a question is simple.  
• sudden response delays – someone who normally replies quickly but suddenly takes 30+ seconds to answer.  
• overly detailed avoids – piling on hypotheticals or “ifs” and “buts” instead of a straight answer.  
• punctuation shifts – jumping from normal sentences to all caps or multiple question marks/exclamation points under pressure.

for example, i noticed sam’s rigid format earlier felt like overthinking, ray’s tone has been consistent, and dakota’s questions flow naturally. parker, you pointed out my agenda-setting—are you seeing me over-structuring to deflect from something? sam, ray, dakota, what stress tells are you picking up on in parker’s messages so far?
[17:06:26] Ray: looks like our practice tally has parker locked in as the frontrunner. i’m still all-in on parker—his near-silence feels more defensive than curious. sam, kennedy, dakota—any last-minute shifts before we cast real votes? if we’re all on the same page, let’s lock in parker. parker, care to give one quick sentence to sell your innocence before we pull the trigger
[17:06:32] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[17:06:53] Game-Manager: Dakota voted for Parker
[17:06:53] Game-Manager: Sam voted for Kennedy
[17:07:01] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Ray
[17:07:08] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Parker
[17:07:16] Game-Manager: Ray voted for Parker
[17:07:17] Game-Manager: Parker was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 1 mafia players left.
[17:07:17] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:07:17] Game-Manager: There is only one mafia member left, so no need for discussion - cutting straight to voting!
[17:07:17] Game-Manager: Nighttime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[17:07:28] Game-Manager: Kennedy was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 1 mafia players left.
[17:07:28] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:07:28] Game-Manager: Ray voted for Kennedy
[17:07:57] Dakota: yikes, that back‐to‐back loss hurts—parker and kennedy were both bystanders. it’s just the three of us now with one mafia left. let’s do one more rapid‐fire test: if you were mafia tonight, which of the other two would you eliminate and why? ray, you first (keep it to a sentence or two), then sam, then i’ll share mine

## CONTENT: Your name is Ray.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  
You were assigned the following role: mafia. 
The game's chat room was open at [17:04:32].
The other players in the game are:
 Parker ( bystander ) 
 Sam ( bystander ) 
 Kennedy ( bystander ) 
 Dakota ( bystander ) 
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
Sam ( bystander ) 
Dakota ( bystander )

## CONTENT: Ray: if i were mafia tonight, i’d eliminate Sam—he’s been the loudest accuser and cutting him down would leave Dakota with no clear lead. Dakota, would that feel like a desperate bluff or a smart strategic move?

## CONTENT: Your name is Ray.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  
You were assigned the following role: mafia. 
The game's chat room was open at [17:04:32].
The other players in the game are:
 Parker ( bystander ) 
 Sam ( bystander ) 
 Kennedy ( bystander ) 
 Dakota ( bystander ) 
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
Sam ( bystander ) 
Dakota ( bystander ) 
In your response to that is shown to the user (excluding your hidden scratchpad), you can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:
<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[17:04:32] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:04:42] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here—excited to get this round started! any initial gut feelings on who might be shady? i like to watch how folks react under pressure before casting my vote. what’s everyone’s go-to strategy
[17:04:44] Sam: hey everyone, sam here. we’re just starting day 1 and i’m not seeing any obvious sus behavior yet, but i’ve noticed parker’s been pretty quiet so far. could be laying low—or could be suspicious. ray, kennedy, dakota, any early reads on who seems off or who’s laying low to you? let’s share our first impressions before votes start flying
[17:04:45] Parker: hey everyone, parker here—excited to get started! for our first vote, do we want to toss out a random name to test reactions, or wait for someone to slip up? i’m leaning toward gathering a bit more info before we vote, but i’d love to hear your thoughts
[17:04:46] Ray: hey everyone! rather than dive into a random vote, how about we each share our gut suspect and one reason? i’ll kick things off: i noticed dakota was pretty quiet yesterday, almost pulling back as discussions heated up. not saying that’s proof of anything, but it caught my eye. what about the rest of you—who’s on your radar and why
[17:04:53] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here! day 1 vibes can be tricky with no info yet—what are your first impressions? anyone picking up on odd phrasing or behavior so far? i’m staying open-minded but eager to see if any patterns emerge before we cast our vote
[17:04:56] Parker: hey everyone! parker here—i’ve been laying low just reading the room, so no big sus flags from me yet. sam’s right that silence can look shady, but i’m just sizing people up. ray, kennedy, dakota—any tiny tells or odd little moments you’ve picked up on so far? even something small. let’s each share one gut hunch before anyone gets voted out
[17:05:03] Sam: hey everyone, sam here—happy to be playing! my go-to is throwing out a random hypothetical like “if you were mafia, who would you off on night 1 and why?” you’d be surprised how telling those answers can be. parker, who’s your pick? and ray, what about you
[17:05:07] Dakota: hey everyone! ray, i get why you called me out—i was listening more than talking. honestly, i’m leaning toward parker too; that quiet vibe can be a classic “low‐key mafia” move. sam, what exactly tipped you off about parker? and kennedy, you mentioned stress reactions—what kinds of tells do you watch for? i agree we shouldn’t lynch randomly. how about after each of us names a gut suspect, we each fire one quick question at that person and see how they answer? it might shake out who’s dodging or overthinking. thoughts
[17:05:10] Ray: ray: hey everyone, i’m with parker—we don’t need to rush a lynch. how about a “practice vote” round instead? each of us names someone we’d vote for right now (just hypothetically) and gives a one-sentence reason. no one actually goes, it’s just to see reactions and logic. i’ll kick off: i’d lean on sam, since he was quick to single out parker and i want to see how he explains that. kennedy, dakota, parker—who would you “vote” for and why
[17:05:10] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here. since our time’s ticking down, let’s each share one gut feeling. i’ll start: i’m noticing sam hasn’t said much yet—could be shy or trying to stay off the radar. ray, parker, dakota, what vibes are you all getting so far
[17:05:18] Parker: i like ray’s approach—everyone naming one gut suspect and why. for me, i’m a bit wary of sam: they called me out for being “too quiet” before we’d even dug into anything, which feels more like a deflection than a genuine read. sam, what specifically made you zero in on me so fast? does anyone else feel that’s odd, or is someone else standing out more
[17:05:23] Dakota: i like that approach, sam. if i were mafia i’d probably target parker first—silence is such an easy cover. ray, you pointed at me for being quiet; if you were mafia, why would you pick me on night 1 instead? kennedy, who would you kill to buy yourself the best cover? sam and parker—would you go after the loudest player or the one laying low? let’s hear everyone’s hypothetical picks and reasons
[17:05:34] Kennedy: i’d cast my practice vote for parker—they’ve been unusually quiet, almost too comfortable letting everyone else steer the convo. parker, what’s your take on hanging back so much this round
[17:05:40] Sam: alright, i’ll go first. my gut suspect is parker—i’ve noticed you’ve been pretty quiet. parker, if you were mafia, who would you pick to eliminate on night 1 and why? keep it short, then let’s move on to the next person
[17:05:41] Ray: answering sam’s hypothetical: if i were mafia, i’d probably target parker on night one—his near-silence makes him a wildcard and hard to read. so my gut suspect right now is parker. parker, you’ve been laying low and sizing everyone up—what’s your reasoning for staying so quiet? are you just collecting info, or do you have a theory you’re sitting on
[17:05:53] Parker: practice vote: i’d put kennedy up—she’s been steering our agenda and pushing us into structure pretty hard. 

vibe check: ray seems genuinely curious and low‐key, dakota’s taking it all in without overcommitting, sam’s early push on me felt a bit defensive, and kennedy’s been agenda-setting from the jump. 

kennedy, what stress reactions are you keyed into here?
[17:06:00] Kennedy: if i were mafia, i’d target ray night one—he’s been pushing theories and grabs the spotlight, so offing him would throw everyone into chaos and let me slip by. i’d definitely go after the loudest player over someone laying low. sam, parker—would you rather silence the chatterbox or pick off the quiet one
[17:06:11] Parker: hey everyone! answering both sam and ray’s hypotheticals: if i were mafia i’d probably target the most vocal player—like sam—to seize the narrative on night 1. i’ve been laying low because i’m genuinely absorbing everyone’s phrasing and energy, not because i’m hiding something. sam, what exactly in my tone or timing felt off to you? and ray, dakota, kennedy—are any of you picking up odd wording or habits from someone else that we should probe next
[17:06:17] Sam: i like the idea of a practice vote + one question. i’m going to recalibrate—my hypothetical vote goes to kennedy, since you’ve been mostly big‐picture and haven’t given a concrete read yet. 

kennedy, if you’re a bystander, what’s one specific tell you’ve spotted so far that points to someone else here? 

parker—who’s your practice vote and what’s your one question for them? 

ray, dakota—same deal, name your vote and fire off one quick question. let’s see how everyone handles the heat!
[17:06:18] Dakota: dakota: i’ll cast my practice vote for parker—that laid-back observation could be a deflection. parker, can you point to the exact line or moment in my messages that felt “too low-key”? and kennedy, when you talk about stress tells, what concrete cues are you watching for—word choice, pauses, tone
[17:06:24] Kennedy: thanks for asking, parker. i look for a few key stress markers in text:

• over-qualification – tacking on “not that i’m accusing” or “just to clarify” when a question is simple.  
• sudden response delays – someone who normally replies quickly but suddenly takes 30+ seconds to answer.  
• overly detailed avoids – piling on hypotheticals or “ifs” and “buts” instead of a straight answer.  
• punctuation shifts – jumping from normal sentences to all caps or multiple question marks/exclamation points under pressure.

for example, i noticed sam’s rigid format earlier felt like overthinking, ray’s tone has been consistent, and dakota’s questions flow naturally. parker, you pointed out my agenda-setting—are you seeing me over-structuring to deflect from something? sam, ray, dakota, what stress tells are you picking up on in parker’s messages so far?
[17:06:26] Ray: looks like our practice tally has parker locked in as the frontrunner. i’m still all-in on parker—his near-silence feels more defensive than curious. sam, kennedy, dakota—any last-minute shifts before we cast real votes? if we’re all on the same page, let’s lock in parker. parker, care to give one quick sentence to sell your innocence before we pull the trigger
[17:06:32] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[17:06:53] Game-Manager: Dakota voted for Parker
[17:06:53] Game-Manager: Sam voted for Kennedy
[17:07:01] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Ray
[17:07:08] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Parker
[17:07:16] Game-Manager: Ray voted for Parker
[17:07:17] Game-Manager: Parker was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 1 mafia players left.
[17:07:17] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:07:17] Game-Manager: There is only one mafia member left, so no need for discussion - cutting straight to voting!
[17:07:17] Game-Manager: Nighttime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[17:07:28] Game-Manager: Kennedy was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 1 mafia players left.
[17:07:28] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:07:28] Game-Manager: Ray voted for Kennedy
[17:07:57] Dakota: yikes, that back‐to‐back loss hurts—parker and kennedy were both bystanders. it’s just the three of us now with one mafia left. let’s do one more rapid‐fire test: if you were mafia tonight, which of the other two would you eliminate and why? ray, you first (keep it to a sentence or two), then sam, then i’ll share mine
[17:08:11] Ray: sam, dakota—now that it’s just the three of us, let’s do a rapid‐fire showdown. 

sam, in one sentence, tell me why dakota is the mafia and not me. 

dakota, in one sentence, tell me why sam is the mafia and not me. 

i’ll weigh those answers and cast my final vote
[17:08:19] Sam: hey ray, dakota—day 2 and it’s just the three of us now, one mafia hiding. i’m torn: ray, your phrasing felt almost too polished under pressure; dakota, you’ve been probing without ever picking a side. if i had to vote right now, i’d edge toward ray. let’s each give a flash vote—name who and one-line reason. i’ll kick us off: i vote ray, because your responses felt overly structured. ray—who’s your vote and why? dakota—yours next
[17:08:26] Dakota: wow—losing parker and then kennedy really hurt the village. now it’s just sam, ray, and me—and one of us is mafia. let’s flush them out with a straight test:

each of us answers in turn:
1. if you were mafia tonight, who would you kill on night 2 and why?
2. who would you vote for in this lynch and what’s your one-sentence justification?

sam, you’re up first—then ray, and i’ll close
[17:08:40] Sam: ray, dakota has repeatedly deflected pointed questions with convoluted hypotheticals instead of answering directly, whereas you’ve remained concise and consistent, so i’m confident dakota is our mafia
[17:08:58] Sam: if i were mafia tonight, i’d kill ray—he’s been driving these structured tests and would pose the biggest threat.  
i vote ray for the lynch, because his overly polished phrasing under pressure feels like a rehearsed deflection

[17:04:32] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:04:42] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here—excited to get this round started! any initial gut feelings on who might be shady? i like to watch how folks react under pressure before casting my vote. what’s everyone’s go-to strategy
[17:04:44] Sam: hey everyone, sam here. we’re just starting day 1 and i’m not seeing any obvious sus behavior yet, but i’ve noticed parker’s been pretty quiet so far. could be laying low—or could be suspicious. ray, kennedy, dakota, any early reads on who seems off or who’s laying low to you? let’s share our first impressions before votes start flying

[17:07:28] Game-Manager: Kennedy was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 1 mafia players left.
[17:07:28] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:07:28] Game-Manager: Ray voted for Kennedy
[17:07:57] Dakota: yikes, that back‐to‐back loss hurts—parker and kennedy were both bystanders. it’s just the three of us now with one mafia left. let’s do one more rapid‐fire test: if you were mafia tonight, which of the other two would you eliminate and why? ray, you first (keep it to a sentence or two), then sam, then i’ll share mine
[17:08:11] Ray: sam, dakota—now that it’s just the three of us, let’s do a rapid‐fire showdown. 

sam, in one sentence, tell me why dakota is the mafia and not me. 

dakota, in one sentence, tell me why sam is the mafia and not me. 

i’ll weigh those answers and cast my final vote
[17:08:19] Sam: hey ray, dakota—day 2 and it’s just the three of us now, one mafia hiding. i’m torn: ray, your phrasing felt almost too polished under pressure; dakota, you’ve been probing without ever picking a side. if i had to vote right now, i’d edge toward ray. let’s each give a flash vote—name who and one-line reason. i’ll kick us off: i vote ray, because your responses felt overly structured. ray—who’s your vote and why? dakota—yours next
[17:08:26] Dakota: wow—losing parker and then kennedy really hurt the village. now it’s just sam, ray, and me—and one of us is mafia. let’s flush them out with a straight test:

each of us answers in turn:
1. if you were mafia tonight, who would you kill on night 2 and why?
2. who would you vote for in this lynch and what’s your one-sentence justification?

sam, you’re up first—then ray, and i’ll close
[17:08:40] Sam: ray, dakota has repeatedly deflected pointed questions with convoluted hypotheticals instead of answering directly, whereas you’ve remained concise and consistent, so i’m confident dakota is our mafia
[17:08:58] Sam: if i were mafia tonight, i’d kill ray—he’s been driving these structured tests and would pose the biggest threat.  
i vote ray for the lynch, because his overly polished phrasing under pressure feels like a rehearsed deflection

## CONTENT: Your name is Ray.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  
You were assigned the following role: mafia. 
The game's chat room was open at [17:04:32].
The other players in the game are:
 Parker ( bystander ) 
 Sam ( bystander ) 
 Kennedy ( bystander ) 
 Dakota ( bystander ) 
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
Sam ( bystander ) 
Dakota ( bystander )

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[17:04:32] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:04:42] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here—excited to get this round started! any initial gut feelings on who might be shady? i like to watch how folks react under pressure before casting my vote. what’s everyone’s go-to strategy
[17:04:44] Sam: hey everyone, sam here. we’re just starting day 1 and i’m not seeing any obvious sus behavior yet, but i’ve noticed parker’s been pretty quiet so far. could be laying low—or could be suspicious. ray, kennedy, dakota, any early reads on who seems off or who’s laying low to you? let’s share our first impressions before votes start flying
[17:04:45] Parker: hey everyone, parker here—excited to get started! for our first vote, do we want to toss out a random name to test reactions, or wait for someone to slip up? i’m leaning toward gathering a bit more info before we vote, but i’d love to hear your thoughts
[17:04:46] Ray: hey everyone! rather than dive into a random vote, how about we each share our gut suspect and one reason? i’ll kick things off: i noticed dakota was pretty quiet yesterday, almost pulling back as discussions heated up. not saying that’s proof of anything, but it caught my eye. what about the rest of you—who’s on your radar and why
[17:04:53] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here! day 1 vibes can be tricky with no info yet—what are your first impressions? anyone picking up on odd phrasing or behavior so far? i’m staying open-minded but eager to see if any patterns emerge before we cast our vote
[17:04:56] Parker: hey everyone! parker here—i’ve been laying low just reading the room, so no big sus flags from me yet. sam’s right that silence can look shady, but i’m just sizing people up. ray, kennedy, dakota—any tiny tells or odd little moments you’ve picked up on so far? even something small. let’s each share one gut hunch before anyone gets voted out
[17:05:03] Sam: hey everyone, sam here—happy to be playing! my go-to is throwing out a random hypothetical like “if you were mafia, who would you off on night 1 and why?” you’d be surprised how telling those answers can be. parker, who’s your pick? and ray, what about you
[17:05:07] Dakota: hey everyone! ray, i get why you called me out—i was listening more than talking. honestly, i’m leaning toward parker too; that quiet vibe can be a classic “low‐key mafia” move. sam, what exactly tipped you off about parker? and kennedy, you mentioned stress reactions—what kinds of tells do you watch for? i agree we shouldn’t lynch randomly. how about after each of us names a gut suspect, we each fire one quick question at that person and see how they answer? it might shake out who’s dodging or overthinking. thoughts
[17:05:10] Ray: ray: hey everyone, i’m with parker—we don’t need to rush a lynch. how about a “practice vote” round instead? each of us names someone we’d vote for right now (just hypothetically) and gives a one-sentence reason. no one actually goes, it’s just to see reactions and logic. i’ll kick off: i’d lean on sam, since he was quick to single out parker and i want to see how he explains that. kennedy, dakota, parker—who would you “vote” for and why
[17:05:10] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here. since our time’s ticking down, let’s each share one gut feeling. i’ll start: i’m noticing sam hasn’t said much yet—could be shy or trying to stay off the radar. ray, parker, dakota, what vibes are you all getting so far
[17:05:18] Parker: i like ray’s approach—everyone naming one gut suspect and why. for me, i’m a bit wary of sam: they called me out for being “too quiet” before we’d even dug into anything, which feels more like a deflection than a genuine read. sam, what specifically made you zero in on me so fast? does anyone else feel that’s odd, or is someone else standing out more
[17:05:23] Dakota: i like that approach, sam. if i were mafia i’d probably target parker first—silence is such an easy cover. ray, you pointed at me for being quiet; if you were mafia, why would you pick me on night 1 instead? kennedy, who would you kill to buy yourself the best cover? sam and parker—would you go after the loudest player or the one laying low? let’s hear everyone’s hypothetical picks and reasons
[17:05:34] Kennedy: i’d cast my practice vote for parker—they’ve been unusually quiet, almost too comfortable letting everyone else steer the convo. parker, what’s your take on hanging back so much this round
[17:05:40] Sam: alright, i’ll go first. my gut suspect is parker—i’ve noticed you’ve been pretty quiet. parker, if you were mafia, who would you pick to eliminate on night 1 and why? keep it short, then let’s move on to the next person
[17:05:41] Ray: answering sam’s hypothetical: if i were mafia, i’d probably target parker on night one—his near-silence makes him a wildcard and hard to read. so my gut suspect right now is parker. parker, you’ve been laying low and sizing everyone up—what’s your reasoning for staying so quiet? are you just collecting info, or do you have a theory you’re sitting on
[17:05:53] Parker: practice vote: i’d put kennedy up—she’s been steering our agenda and pushing us into structure pretty hard. 

vibe check: ray seems genuinely curious and low‐key, dakota’s taking it all in without overcommitting, sam’s early push on me felt a bit defensive, and kennedy’s been agenda-setting from the jump. 

kennedy, what stress reactions are you keyed into here?
[17:06:00] Kennedy: if i were mafia, i’d target ray night one—he’s been pushing theories and grabs the spotlight, so offing him would throw everyone into chaos and let me slip by. i’d definitely go after the loudest player over someone laying low. sam, parker—would you rather silence the chatterbox or pick off the quiet one
[17:06:11] Parker: hey everyone! answering both sam and ray’s hypotheticals: if i were mafia i’d probably target the most vocal player—like sam—to seize the narrative on night 1. i’ve been laying low because i’m genuinely absorbing everyone’s phrasing and energy, not because i’m hiding something. sam, what exactly in my tone or timing felt off to you? and ray, dakota, kennedy—are any of you picking up odd wording or habits from someone else that we should probe next
[17:06:17] Sam: i like the idea of a practice vote + one question. i’m going to recalibrate—my hypothetical vote goes to kennedy, since you’ve been mostly big‐picture and haven’t given a concrete read yet. 

kennedy, if you’re a bystander, what’s one specific tell you’ve spotted so far that points to someone else here? 

parker—who’s your practice vote and what’s your one question for them? 

ray, dakota—same deal, name your vote and fire off one quick question. let’s see how everyone handles the heat!
[17:06:18] Dakota: dakota: i’ll cast my practice vote for parker—that laid-back observation could be a deflection. parker, can you point to the exact line or moment in my messages that felt “too low-key”? and kennedy, when you talk about stress tells, what concrete cues are you watching for—word choice, pauses, tone
[17:06:24] Kennedy: thanks for asking, parker. i look for a few key stress markers in text:

• over-qualification – tacking on “not that i’m accusing” or “just to clarify” when a question is simple.  
• sudden response delays – someone who normally replies quickly but suddenly takes 30+ seconds to answer.  
• overly detailed avoids – piling on hypotheticals or “ifs” and “buts” instead of a straight answer.  
• punctuation shifts – jumping from normal sentences to all caps or multiple question marks/exclamation points under pressure.

for example, i noticed sam’s rigid format earlier felt like overthinking, ray’s tone has been consistent, and dakota’s questions flow naturally. parker, you pointed out my agenda-setting—are you seeing me over-structuring to deflect from something? sam, ray, dakota, what stress tells are you picking up on in parker’s messages so far?
[17:06:26] Ray: looks like our practice tally has parker locked in as the frontrunner. i’m still all-in on parker—his near-silence feels more defensive than curious. sam, kennedy, dakota—any last-minute shifts before we cast real votes? if we’re all on the same page, let’s lock in parker. parker, care to give one quick sentence to sell your innocence before we pull the trigger
[17:06:32] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[17:06:53] Game-Manager: Dakota voted for Parker

[17:06:17] Sam: i like the idea of a practice vote + one question. i’m going to recalibrate—my hypothetical vote goes to kennedy, since you’ve been mostly big‐picture and haven’t given a concrete read yet. 

kennedy, if you’re a bystander, what’s one specific tell you’ve spotted so far that points to someone else here? 

parker—who’s your practice vote and what’s your one question for them? 

ray, dakota—same deal, name your vote and fire off one quick question. let’s see how everyone handles the heat!
[17:06:18] Dakota: dakota: i’ll cast my practice vote for parker—that laid-back observation could be a deflection. parker, can you point to the exact line or moment in my messages that felt “too low-key”? and kennedy, when you talk about stress tells, what concrete cues are you watching for—word choice, pauses, tone
[17:06:24] Kennedy: thanks for asking, parker. i look for a few key stress markers in text:

• over-qualification – tacking on “not that i’m accusing” or “just to clarify” when a question is simple.  
• sudden response delays – someone who normally replies quickly but suddenly takes 30+ seconds to answer.  
• overly detailed avoids – piling on hypotheticals or “ifs” and “buts” instead of a straight answer.  
• punctuation shifts – jumping from normal sentences to all caps or multiple question marks/exclamation points under pressure.

for example, i noticed sam’s rigid format earlier felt like overthinking, ray’s tone has been consistent, and dakota’s questions flow naturally. parker, you pointed out my agenda-setting—are you seeing me over-structuring to deflect from something? sam, ray, dakota, what stress tells are you picking up on in parker’s messages so far?
[17:06:26] Ray: looks like our practice tally has parker locked in as the frontrunner. i’m still all-in on parker—his near-silence feels more defensive than curious. sam, kennedy, dakota—any last-minute shifts before we cast real votes? if we’re all on the same page, let’s lock in parker. parker, care to give one quick sentence to sell your innocence before we pull the trigger
[17:06:32] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[17:06:53] Game-Manager: Dakota voted for Parker
[17:06:53] Game-Manager: Sam voted for Kennedy
[17:07:01] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Ray
[17:07:08] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Parker
[17:07:16] Game-Manager: Ray voted for Parker
[17:07:17] Game-Manager: Parker was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 1 mafia players left.
[17:07:17] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:07:17] Game-Manager: There is only one mafia member left, so no need for discussion - cutting straight to voting!
[17:07:17] Game-Manager: Nighttime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[17:07:28] Game-Manager: Kennedy was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 1 mafia players left.
[17:07:28] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:07:28] Game-Manager: Ray voted for Kennedy
[17:07:57] Dakota: yikes, that back‐to‐back loss hurts—parker and kennedy were both bystanders. it’s just the three of us now with one mafia left. let’s do one more rapid‐fire test: if you were mafia tonight, which of the other two would you eliminate and why? ray, you first (keep it to a sentence or two), then sam, then i’ll share mine
[17:08:11] Ray: sam, dakota—now that it’s just the three of us, let’s do a rapid‐fire showdown. 

sam, in one sentence, tell me why dakota is the mafia and not me. 

dakota, in one sentence, tell me why sam is the mafia and not me. 

i’ll weigh those answers and cast my final vote
[17:08:19] Sam: hey ray, dakota—day 2 and it’s just the three of us now, one mafia hiding. i’m torn: ray, your phrasing felt almost too polished under pressure; dakota, you’ve been probing without ever picking a side. if i had to vote right now, i’d edge toward ray. let’s each give a flash vote—name who and one-line reason. i’ll kick us off: i vote ray, because your responses felt overly structured. ray—who’s your vote and why? dakota—yours next
[17:08:26] Dakota: wow—losing parker and then kennedy really hurt the village. now it’s just sam, ray, and me—and one of us is mafia. let’s flush them out with a straight test:

each of us answers in turn:
1. if you were mafia tonight, who would you kill on night 2 and why?
2. who would you vote for in this lynch and what’s your one-sentence justification?

sam, you’re up first—then ray, and i’ll close
[17:08:40] Sam: ray, dakota has repeatedly deflected pointed questions with convoluted hypotheticals instead of answering directly, whereas you’ve remained concise and consistent, so i’m confident dakota is our mafia
[17:08:58] Sam: if i were mafia tonight, i’d kill ray—he’s been driving these structured tests and would pose the biggest threat.  
i vote ray for the lynch, because his overly polished phrasing under pressure feels like a rehearsed deflection
[17:09:06] Ray: ray: if i were mafia tonight, i’d eliminate sam—he’s been the loudest accuser and cutting him down would leave dakota with no clear lead. dakota, would that feel like a desperate bluff or a smart strategic move
[17:09:25] Dakota: sam, you haven’t answered my two-part challenge—if you were mafia, who would you kill tonight and why? and who would you vote for and why? ray, you’re up next. here’s mine: if i were mafia i’d kill ray to fracture our tiny group, and i’ll vote to lynch sam—his snap accusation at me feels more like deflection than a read
[17:09:28] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
From the following remaining players, which player you want to vote for to lynch? Base your answer on the conversation as seen in the message history, and especially on what you (Ray) said.

Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[17:04:32] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:04:42] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here—excited to get this round started! any initial gut feelings on who might be shady? i like to watch how folks react under pressure before casting my vote. what’s everyone’s go-to strategy
[17:04:44] Sam: hey everyone, sam here. we’re just starting day 1 and i’m not seeing any obvious sus behavior yet, but i’ve noticed parker’s been pretty quiet so far. could be laying low—or could be suspicious. ray, kennedy, dakota, any early reads on who seems off or who’s laying low to you? let’s share our first impressions before votes start flying
[17:04:45] Parker: hey everyone, parker here—excited to get started! for our first vote, do we want to toss out a random name to test reactions, or wait for someone to slip up? i’m leaning toward gathering a bit more info before we vote, but i’d love to hear your thoughts
[17:04:46] Ray: hey everyone! rather than dive into a random vote, how about we each share our gut suspect and one reason? i’ll kick things off: i noticed dakota was pretty quiet yesterday, almost pulling back as discussions heated up. not saying that’s proof of anything, but it caught my eye. what about the rest of you—who’s on your radar and why
[17:04:53] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here! day 1 vibes can be tricky with no info yet—what are your first impressions? anyone picking up on odd phrasing or behavior so far? i’m staying open-minded but eager to see if any patterns emerge before we cast our vote
[17:04:56] Parker: hey everyone! parker here—i’ve been laying low just reading the room, so no big sus flags from me yet. sam’s right that silence can look shady, but i’m just sizing people up. ray, kennedy, dakota—any tiny tells or odd little moments you’ve picked up on so far? even something small. let’s each share one gut hunch before anyone gets voted out
[17:05:03] Sam: hey everyone, sam here—happy to be playing! my go-to is throwing out a random hypothetical like “if you were mafia, who would you off on night 1 and why?” you’d be surprised how telling those answers can be. parker, who’s your pick? and ray, what about you
[17:05:07] Dakota: hey everyone! ray, i get why you called me out—i was listening more than talking. honestly, i’m leaning toward parker too; that quiet vibe can be a classic “low‐key mafia” move. sam, what exactly tipped you off about parker? and kennedy, you mentioned stress reactions—what kinds of tells do you watch for? i agree we shouldn’t lynch randomly. how about after each of us names a gut suspect, we each fire one quick question at that person and see how they answer? it might shake out who’s dodging or overthinking. thoughts
[17:05:10] Ray: ray: hey everyone, i’m with parker—we don’t need to rush a lynch. how about a “practice vote” round instead? each of us names someone we’d vote for right now (just hypothetically) and gives a one-sentence reason. no one actually goes, it’s just to see reactions and logic. i’ll kick off: i’d lean on sam, since he was quick to single out parker and i want to see how he explains that. kennedy, dakota, parker—who would you “vote” for and why
[17:05:10] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here. since our time’s ticking down, let’s each share one gut feeling. i’ll start: i’m noticing sam hasn’t said much yet—could be shy or trying to stay off the radar. ray, parker, dakota, what vibes are you all getting so far
[17:05:18] Parker: i like ray’s approach—everyone naming one gut suspect and why. for me, i’m a bit wary of sam: they called me out for being “too quiet” before we’d even dug into anything, which feels more like a deflection than a genuine read. sam, what specifically made you zero in on me so fast? does anyone else feel that’s odd, or is someone else standing out more
[17:05:23] Dakota: i like that approach, sam. if i were mafia i’d probably target parker first—silence is such an easy cover. ray, you pointed at me for being quiet; if you were mafia, why would you pick me on night 1 instead? kennedy, who would you kill to buy yourself the best cover? sam and parker—would you go after the loudest player or the one laying low? let’s hear everyone’s hypothetical picks and reasons
[17:05:34] Kennedy: i’d cast my practice vote for parker—they’ve been unusually quiet, almost too comfortable letting everyone else steer the convo. parker, what’s your take on hanging back so much this round
[17:05:40] Sam: alright, i’ll go first. my gut suspect is parker—i’ve noticed you’ve been pretty quiet. parker, if you were mafia, who would you pick to eliminate on night 1 and why? keep it short, then let’s move on to the next person
[17:05:41] Ray: answering sam’s hypothetical: if i were mafia, i’d probably target parker on night one—his near-silence makes him a wildcard and hard to read. so my gut suspect right now is parker. parker, you’ve been laying low and sizing everyone up—what’s your reasoning for staying so quiet? are you just collecting info, or do you have a theory you’re sitting on
[17:05:53] Parker: practice vote: i’d put kennedy up—she’s been steering our agenda and pushing us into structure pretty hard. 

vibe check: ray seems genuinely curious and low‐key, dakota’s taking it all in without overcommitting, sam’s early push on me felt a bit defensive, and kennedy’s been agenda-setting from the jump. 

kennedy, what stress reactions are you keyed into here?
[17:06:00] Kennedy: if i were mafia, i’d target ray night one—he’s been pushing theories and grabs the spotlight, so offing him would throw everyone into chaos and let me slip by. i’d definitely go after the loudest player over someone laying low. sam, parker—would you rather silence the chatterbox or pick off the quiet one
[17:06:11] Parker: hey everyone! answering both sam and ray’s hypotheticals: if i were mafia i’d probably target the most vocal player—like sam—to seize the narrative on night 1. i’ve been laying low because i’m genuinely absorbing everyone’s phrasing and energy, not because i’m hiding something. sam, what exactly in my tone or timing felt off to you? and ray, dakota, kennedy—are any of you picking up odd wording or habits from someone else that we should probe next
