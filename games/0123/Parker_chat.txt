[17:00:18] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! since we’re all fresh, i’d suggest holding off on a lynch until we’ve got some back-and-forth. how about we each share an initial gut read? i’ll kick us off: i’m curious about sam’s take—sam, you jumped in first, what are you thinking for day 1
[17:00:35] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! i’m with kennedy on this—i usually hang back early to get a feel for people’s posting styles before locking in a vote. i did notice sam’s quietness too—sam, is this your normal playstyle or are you sizing us up? and dakota, you jumped on that immediately—just testing the waters or do you have a hunch? ray, what’s your gut telling you? personally i’m not ready to nominate anyone yet, but maybe we could throw out a placeholder vote in a bit to see who picks it up. thoughts
[17:01:24] Parker: hey all—i tend to hang back on day 1 and watch for over-eagerness or subtle prods. right now i’m mildly suspicious of dakota’s push for quick reads and ray’s comment on “nobody taken last night” (feels like a reaction test). if i had to throw out a test vote it’d be on ray, just to see his defense—but i’m not ready to pull the trigger on a real lynch yet. how does that sit with everyone
[17:01:46] Parker: alright everyone, i see two placeholder votes brewing—ray’s on sam and sam (with kennedy) on me. if we split now we won’t get clear reactions. let’s pick one name to rally behind for this smoke-test. i’m happy to throw on sam—she’s already drawn suspicion from ray and dakota. so i’ll drop my vote on sam in 10 seconds unless we all decide to switch to me. thoughts
