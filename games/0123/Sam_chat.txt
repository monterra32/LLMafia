[17:00:09] Sam: hey everyone, sam here—excited to get started! since it’s day 1 and we’ve all just logged on, how about we go around and share our initial gut feelings? i don’t have any strong reads yet, but i’m curious to see who wants to jump in first. ray, parker, kennedy, dakota—who’s up
[17:00:30] Sam: hey everyone! sam here—sorry for the quiet start, just taking it all in. i did notice parker and ray haven’t chimed in yet… could be laying low or just watching. ray, kennedy, what are your initial thoughts on that? if you had to pick one person to target first, who would it be and why? and do we want to pull the trigger early on a vote, or wait to gather more info? excited to hear everyone’s gut feelings
[17:00:58] Sam: ok, i’ll kick us off with a quick gut-read. i’m watching ray—he was super quick to point at me, almost like probing. dakota calling out my quietness so early also felt like a preemptive spotlight. parker, kennedy—what are you both picking up on
[17:01:23] Sam: good point, kennedy. parker’s been steering questions without really giving us his own reads—makes me curious. how about a quick test vote on parker to see who jumps to defend or pile on? ray, dakota, what do you think? i’ll drop my placeholder vote on parker in 30 seconds unless you think we should hold off
