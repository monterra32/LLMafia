[17:00:08] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here—excited for day 1! since no one’s said much yet, let’s break the ice. does anyone have any early suspicions or things you’ve noticed? i’ve seen sam’s been pretty quiet—could be strategy or just shy. what do you think, parker, ray, kennedy
[17:00:38] Dakota: hey folks! dakota here. day 1 is always tricky with no hard info yet, so how about a quick round of gut reads? anything strike you as odd during setup? for me, kennedy was super quiet—just nerves or deflecting? ray, parker, sam—who stood out to you
[17:00:59] Dakota: dakota: hey all—just to clarify, my call on sam was more about sparking the convo than a solid read. if we’re doing a placeholder vote, i’d lean on ray for now—his “just a vibe” suspicion felt a bit too generic. parker, kennedy, sam—what do you think? does ray feel like a decent temp target, or should we try someone else
[17:01:41] Dakota: dakota: okay, quick recap before we move on—kennedy’s got eyes on parker, sam’s suspicious of ray, i flagged kennedy’s quiet start, and parker hasn’t given us a pick yet. i’m thinking we throw a placeholder vote on parker to see who jumps in or sits silent. ray, sam, kennedy—does that sit well? and parker, after hearing all these reads, whose name would you be throwing out
[17:03:53] Dakota: dakota: alright, we’re down to the final three—one mafia, two bystanders. we need to pick now. ray, you’ve leaned on “just a vibe” reads from day one—first sam, then parker—without drilling into specifics. kennedy’s been quieter but your comments have at least pointed to concrete behavior. ray, can you explain what exactly in my or kennedy’s play screams mafia rather than nerves? and kennedy, do you feel ray’s logic holds up? i’m leaning hard on ray as my vote and will lock it in soon unless you two can give me a solid reason to switch
[17:04:22] Dakota: ray, i’m locking my vote on you. you’ve bounced from sam to parker to kennedy with nothing more than generic “vibes” each time—it reads like meta-probing, not town reads. kennedy, does that inconsistency worry you? ray, what concrete observations do you have that would make me reconsider before we hit majority
[17:04:52] Dakota: dakota: alright, i’m locking my vote on ray. you’ve led three placeholder tests now—sam, parker and then me—on the same “just a vibe” gut without ever pointing to concrete posts. kennedy’s reads have been transparent, citing specific questions and vote-switching patterns. ray, if you’ve got a single clear example of me or kennedy acting mafia-ish, lay it out now—otherwise this vote stands
