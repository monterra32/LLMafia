[17:00:13] Kennedy: hey everyone! kennedy here—happy to be playing with you all. since it’s day 1 and we don’t have anything concrete yet, i’m curious how you like to approach these opening hours. do you prefer to throw out a random vote to see reactions, or hang back and gather more info before deciding? i tend to listen first and see who jumps on or hesitates. what’s your usual day 1 strategy (or any initial gut reads
[17:00:32] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here—dakota, good call pointing out sam’s quietness. that could be a mafia play or just day 1 nerves. ray and parker have barely spoken so far—curious if that’s strategy or just chill. i’m not ready to vote yet, but i’d love to hear initial gut reads from ray and parker before we all pile on someone. what are you both thinking
[17:00:51] Kennedy: hey everyone, interesting points so far—i’m more of a wait-and-see player, but since we’re kicking things off i’ll share a quick gut: i’m a bit curious about parker. he’s steered the convo by asking others for reads but hasn’t really given us his own beyond pointing at sam. could be strategic or just cautious. personally i’m not ready to lock in a vote yet—i’d rather get another round of thoughts. if we did test the waters with an early vote, i’d throw parker’s name out there to see who jumps on or defends him. what do you all think? how about dakota and sam—any fresh takes before we decide whether to pull the trigger
[17:01:38] Kennedy: i’m good with throwing ray’s name into our placeholder vote—his “just a vibe” felt pretty generic, and nominating him will let us see who jumps to defend or pile on. unless someone strongly objects, let’s put ray up and watch the reactions. parker, sam—what do you think? if you’d rather test someone else (like parker), speak now
[17:03:45] Kennedy: wow, sam’s gone too—so it’s just ray, dakota and me, and one mafia. i’m narrowing in on dakota: her early “sparking the convo” reads felt more like steering us than genuine logic, and she hasn’t given any detailed observations. ray, what are you seeing? and dakota, why should i swap to ray instead? let’s get our final thoughts before we vote
[17:04:04] Kennedy: ray, before you lock that in, let’s break down what happened so far. on day 1 you led the charge on sam with almost no evidence, then flipped to target parker seconds later. now you’re pointing at me based on my “generic” day 1 gut read—but my approach has been consistent: gather info, ask questions, then test with placeholder votes. your voting swings look more like forced deflection than genuine suspicion.  

dakota, you’ve watched all of this—whose pattern feels more mafia-ish? my reads have been consistent and transparent. ray’s have been reactive and all over the place. ray, can you point to one concrete behavior of mine that still worries you, instead of re-using your day 1 “vibe”? i think that clarity will help dakota—and all of us—cast the right deciding vote
[17:04:57] Kennedy: i’m locking my vote on dakota. she’s led every test‐vote with flimsy “sparking the convo” or “just a vibe” reasons—first sam’s quietness, then parker’s generic hunch, and now she’s flipping again to deflect on me. that pattern of steering the house each round reads like mafia pushing the narrative. dakota, can you explain how your constant flip-flops aren’t just you orchestrating the day? ray, will you join me on dakota or are you sticking with vibes? let’s decide now
