## CONTENT: You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  +

## CONTENT: Your name is Sam.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [16:59:55].
The other players in the game are:
 Ray ( unknown ) 
 Parker ( unknown ) 
 Kennedy ( unknown ) 
 Dakota ( unknown ) 
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:

<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.

[17:00:13] Kennedy: hey everyone! kennedy here—happy to be playing with you all. since it’s day 1 and we don’t have anything concrete yet, i’m curious how you like to approach these opening hours. do you prefer to throw out a random vote to see reactions, or hang back and gather more info before deciding? i tend to listen first and see who jumps on or hesitates. what’s your usual day 1 strategy (or any initial gut reads
[17:00:18] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! since we’re all fresh, i’d suggest holding off on a lynch until we’ve got some back-and-forth. how about we each share an initial gut read? i’ll kick us off: i’m curious about sam’s take—sam, you jumped in first, what are you thinking for day 1
[17:00:21] Ray: hey everyone, ray here! pumped for day 1. interesting nobody got taken last night—mafia must be laying low. to break the ice, let’s each share a quick gut feel on someone. i’m mildly suspicious of sam—just a vibe. what about you all? parker? kennedy? dakota
Do you want to send a message to the group chat now, or do you prefer to wait for now and see what messages others will send? Remember to choose to send a message only if your contribution to the discussion in the current time will be meaningful enough. Don't overflow the discussion with your messages! Pay attention to the amount of messages with your name compared to the amount of messages with names of other players and let them have their turn too! Check the speaker name in the last few messages, and decide accordingly based on whether you talked too much. Reply only with `<send>` if you want to send a message now, or only with `<wait>` if you want to wait for now, based on your decision!

## CONTENT: Your name is Sam.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  
You were assigned the following role: bystander.

[17:00:08] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here—excited for day 1! since no one’s said much yet, let’s break the ice. does anyone have any early suspicions or things you’ve noticed? i’ve seen sam’s been pretty quiet—could be strategy or just shy. what do you think, parker, ray, kennedy
[16:59:55] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:00:09] Sam: hey everyone, sam here—excited to get started! since it’s day 1 and we’ve all just logged on, how about we go around and share our initial gut feelings? i don’t have any strong reads yet, but i’m curious to see who wants to jump in first. ray, parker, kennedy, dakota—who’s up
[17:00:13] Kennedy: hey everyone! kennedy here—happy to be playing with you all. since it’s day 1 and we don’t have anything concrete yet, i’m curious how you like to approach these opening hours. do you prefer to throw out a random vote to see reactions, or hang back and gather more info before deciding? i tend to listen first and see who jumps on or hesitates. what’s your usual day 1 strategy (or any initial gut reads
[17:00:18] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! since we’re all fresh, i’d suggest holding off on a lynch until we’ve got some back-and-forth. how about we each share an initial gut read? i’ll kick us off: i’m curious about sam’s take—sam, you jumped in first, what are you thinking for day 1
[17:00:21] Ray: hey everyone, ray here! pumped for day 1. interesting nobody got taken last night—mafia must be laying low. to break the ice, let’s each share a quick gut feel on someone. i’m mildly suspicious of sam—just a vibe. what about you all? parker? kennedy? dakota
[17:00:30] Sam: hey everyone! sam here—sorry for the quiet start, just taking it all in. i did notice parker and ray haven’t chimed in yet… could be laying low or just watching. ray, kennedy, what are your initial thoughts on that? if you had to pick one person to target first, who would it be and why? and do we want to pull the trigger early on a vote, or wait to gather more info? excited to hear everyone’s gut feelings
[17:00:32] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here—dakota, good call pointing out sam’s quietness. that could be a mafia play or just day 1 nerves. ray and parker have barely spoken so far—curious if that’s strategy or just chill. i’m not ready to vote yet, but i’d love to hear initial gut reads from ray and parker before we all pile on someone. what are you both thinking
[17:00:35] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! i’m with kennedy on this—i usually hang back early to get a feel for people’s posting styles before locking in a vote. i did notice sam’s quietness too—sam, is this your normal playstyle or are you sizing us up? and dakota, you jumped on that immediately—just testing the waters or do you have a hunch? ray, what’s your gut telling you? personally i’m not ready to nominate anyone yet, but maybe we could throw out a placeholder vote in a bit to see who picks it up. thoughts
[17:00:38] Dakota: hey folks! dakota here. day 1 is always tricky with no hard info yet, so how about a quick round of gut reads? anything strike you as odd during setup? for me, kennedy was super quiet—just nerves or deflecting? ray, parker, sam—who stood out to you
[17:00:43] Ray: hey everyone, ray here! i’m with parker on holding off a lynch until we see more behavior—day 1 is for info-gathering. my go-to is to ask open questions and watch reactions. for example, dakota flagged sam’s quietness—sam, are you just easing in or do you have a read already? kennedy, when you talk random votes vs. listening, which camp are you in today? and parker, anything else you’ve noticed beyond the usual greetings? let’s share concrete observations before we lock in any votes
[17:00:51] Kennedy: hey everyone, interesting points so far—i’m more of a wait-and-see player, but since we’re kicking things off i’ll share a quick gut: i’m a bit curious about parker. he’s steered the convo by asking others for reads but hasn’t really given us his own beyond pointing at sam. could be strategic or just cautious. personally i’m not ready to lock in a vote yet—i’d rather get another round of thoughts. if we did test the waters with an early vote, i’d throw parker’s name out there to see who jumps on or defends him. what do you all think? how about dakota and sam—any fresh takes before we decide whether to pull the trigger

Ray, Dakota, what do you think? I’ll drop my placeholder vote on Parker in 30 seconds unless you think we should hold off.

## CONTENT: Your name is Sam.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [16:59:55].

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[17:00:08] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here—excited for day 1! since no one’s said much yet, let’s break the ice. does anyone have any early suspicions or things you’ve noticed? i’ve seen sam’s been pretty quiet—could be strategy or just shy. what do you think, parker, ray, kennedy
[16:59:55] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:00:09] Sam: hey everyone, sam here—excited to get started! since it’s day 1 and we’ve all just logged on, how about we go around and share our initial gut feelings? i don’t have any strong reads yet, but i’m curious to see who wants to jump in first. ray, parker, kennedy, dakota—who’s up
[17:00:13] Kennedy: hey everyone! kennedy here—happy to be playing with you all. since it’s day 1 and we don’t have anything concrete yet, i’m curious how you like to approach these opening hours. do you prefer to throw out a random vote to see reactions, or hang back and gather more info before deciding? i tend to listen first and see who jumps on or hesitates. what’s your usual day 1 strategy (or any initial gut reads
[17:00:18] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! since we’re all fresh, i’d suggest holding off on a lynch until we’ve got some back-and-forth. how about we each share an initial gut read? i’ll kick us off: i’m curious about sam’s take—sam, you jumped in first, what are you thinking for day 1
[17:00:21] Ray: hey everyone, ray here! pumped for day 1. interesting nobody got taken last night—mafia must be laying low. to break the ice, let’s each share a quick gut feel on someone. i’m mildly suspicious of sam—just a vibe. what about you all? parker? kennedy? dakota
[17:00:30] Sam: hey everyone! sam here—sorry for the quiet start, just taking it all in. i did notice parker and ray haven’t chimed in yet… could be laying low or just watching. ray, kennedy, what are your initial thoughts on that? if you had to pick one person to target first, who would it be and why? and do we want to pull the trigger early on a vote, or wait to gather more info? excited to hear everyone’s gut feelings
[17:00:32] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here—dakota, good call pointing out sam’s quietness. that could be a mafia play or just day 1 nerves. ray and parker have barely spoken so far—curious if that’s strategy or just chill. i’m not ready to vote yet, but i’d love to hear initial gut reads from ray and parker before we all pile on someone. what are you both thinking
[17:00:35] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! i’m with kennedy on this—i usually hang back early to get a feel for people’s posting styles before locking in a vote. i did notice sam’s quietness too—sam, is this your normal playstyle or are you sizing us up? and dakota, you jumped on that immediately—just testing the waters or do you have a hunch? ray, what’s your gut telling you? personally i’m not ready to nominate anyone yet, but maybe we could throw out a placeholder vote in a bit to see who picks it up. thoughts
[17:00:38] Dakota: hey folks! dakota here. day 1 is always tricky with no hard info yet, so how about a quick round of gut reads? anything strike you as odd during setup? for me, kennedy was super quiet—just nerves or deflecting? ray, parker, sam—who stood out to you
[17:00:43] Ray: hey everyone, ray here! i’m with parker on holding off a lynch until we see more behavior—day 1 is for info-gathering. my go-to is to ask open questions and watch reactions. for example, dakota flagged sam’s quietness—sam, are you just easing in or do you have a read already? kennedy, when you talk random votes vs. listening, which camp are you in today? and parker, anything else you’ve noticed beyond the usual greetings? let’s share concrete observations before we lock in any votes
[17:00:51] Kennedy: hey everyone, interesting points so far—i’m more of a wait-and-see player, but since we’re kicking things off i’ll share a quick gut: i’m a bit curious about parker. he’s steered the convo by asking others for reads but hasn’t really given us his own beyond pointing at sam. could be strategic or just cautious. personally i’m not ready to lock in a vote yet—i’d rather get another round of thoughts. if we did test the waters with an early vote, i’d throw parker’s name out there to see who jumps on or defends him. what do you all think? how about dakota and sam—any fresh takes before we decide whether to pull the trigger
[17:00:58] Sam: ok, i’ll kick us off with a quick gut-read. i’m watching ray—he was super quick to point at me, almost like probing. dakota calling out my quietness so early also felt like a preemptive spotlight. parker, kennedy—what are you both picking up on
[17:00:59] Dakota: dakota: hey all—just to clarify, my call on sam was more about sparking the convo than a solid read. if we’re doing a placeholder vote, i’d lean on ray for now—his “just a vibe” suspicion felt a bit too generic. parker, kennedy, sam—what do you think? does ray feel like a decent temp target, or should we try someone else
[17:01:03] Ray: hey folks, ray here—i'm going to tentatively throw my vote on sam. that level of quiet feels a little too polished, you know? it’s just a smoke-test, so feel free to rally behind her or pivot if someone else seems fishy. parker, kennedy, dakota—thoughts

[17:00:43] Ray: hey everyone, ray here! i’m with parker on holding off a lynch until we see more behavior—day 1 is for info-gathering. my go-to is to ask open questions and watch reactions. for example, dakota flagged sam’s quietness—sam, are you just easing in or do you have a read already? kennedy, when you talk random votes vs. listening, which camp are you in today? and parker, anything else you’ve noticed beyond the usual greetings? let’s share concrete observations before we lock in any votes
[17:00:51] Kennedy: hey everyone, interesting points so far—i’m more of a wait-and-see player, but since we’re kicking things off i’ll share a quick gut: i’m a bit curious about parker. he’s steered the convo by asking others for reads but hasn’t really given us his own beyond pointing at sam. could be strategic or just cautious. personally i’m not ready to lock in a vote yet—i’d rather get another round of thoughts. if we did test the waters with an early vote, i’d throw parker’s name out there to see who jumps on or defends him. what do you all think? how about dakota and sam—any fresh takes before we decide whether to pull the trigger
[17:00:58] Sam: ok, i’ll kick us off with a quick gut-read. i’m watching ray—he was super quick to point at me, almost like probing. dakota calling out my quietness so early also felt like a preemptive spotlight. parker, kennedy—what are you both picking up on
[17:00:59] Dakota: dakota: hey all—just to clarify, my call on sam was more about sparking the convo than a solid read. if we’re doing a placeholder vote, i’d lean on ray for now—his “just a vibe” suspicion felt a bit too generic. parker, kennedy, sam—what do you think? does ray feel like a decent temp target, or should we try someone else
[17:01:03] Ray: hey folks, ray here—i'm going to tentatively throw my vote on sam. that level of quiet feels a little too polished, you know? it’s just a smoke-test, so feel free to rally behind her or pivot if someone else seems fishy. parker, kennedy, dakota—thoughts
[17:01:23] Sam: good point, kennedy. parker’s been steering questions without really giving us his own reads—makes me curious. how about a quick test vote on parker to see who jumps to defend or pile on? ray, dakota, what do you think? i’ll drop my placeholder vote on parker in 30 seconds unless you think we should hold off
[17:01:24] Parker: hey all—i tend to hang back on day 1 and watch for over-eagerness or subtle prods. right now i’m mildly suspicious of dakota’s push for quick reads and ray’s comment on “nobody taken last night” (feels like a reaction test). if i had to throw out a test vote it’d be on ray, just to see his defense—but i’m not ready to pull the trigger on a real lynch yet. how does that sit with everyone
[17:01:24] Ray: i get why you’d pick on my “just a vibe” call—it’s day 1 and pretty flimsy. instead, i’d rather test parker: he’s been asking everyone else for reads but hasn’t given us any concrete suspicions of his own, which to me feels like playing it safe. how about a placeholder vote on parker to see who jumps on or defends? sam, kennedy, dakota—what do you think
[17:01:38] Kennedy: i’m good with throwing ray’s name into our placeholder vote—his “just a vibe” felt pretty generic, and nominating him will let us see who jumps to defend or pile on. unless someone strongly objects, let’s put ray up and watch the reactions. parker, sam—what do you think? if you’d rather test someone else (like parker), speak now

[17:01:46] Parker: alright everyone, i see two placeholder votes brewing—ray’s on sam and sam (with kennedy) on me. if we split now we won’t get clear reactions. let’s pick one name to rally behind for this smoke-test. i’m happy to throw on sam—she’s already drawn suspicion from ray and dakota. so i’ll drop my vote on sam in 10 seconds unless we all decide to switch to me. thoughts
[17:01:51] Ray: ray: hey everyone, ray here—i’m fine with a quick placeholder vote on parker. i’ll set my vote on him in 15 seconds unless someone wants to pick a different temp target. parker, any early reaction to being in the hot seat? curious who jumps to defend or oppose him. sam, you flipped onto parker pretty fast—what tipped you? dakota, kennedy—thoughts before we lock in our test vote

[17:00:30] Sam: hey everyone! sam here—sorry for the quiet start, just taking it all in. i did notice parker and ray haven’t chimed in yet… could be laying low or just watching. ray, kennedy, what are your initial thoughts on that? if you had to pick one person to target first, who would it be and why? and do we want to pull the trigger early on a vote, or wait to gather more info? excited to hear everyone’s gut feelings
[17:00:32] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here—dakota, good call pointing out sam’s quietness. that could be a mafia play or just day 1 nerves. ray and parker have barely spoken so far—curious if that’s strategy or just chill. i’m not ready to vote yet, but i’d love to hear initial gut reads from ray and parker before we all pile on someone. what are you both thinking
[17:00:35] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! i’m with kennedy on this—i usually hang back early to get a feel for people’s posting styles before locking in a vote. i did notice sam’s quietness too—sam, is this your normal playstyle or are you sizing us up? and dakota, you jumped on that immediately—just testing the waters or do you have a hunch? ray, what’s your gut telling you? personally i’m not ready to nominate anyone yet, but maybe we could throw out a placeholder vote in a bit to see who picks it up. thoughts
[17:00:38] Dakota: hey folks! dakota here. day 1 is always tricky with no hard info yet, so how about a quick round of gut reads? anything strike you as odd during setup? for me, kennedy was super quiet—just nerves or deflecting? ray, parker, sam—who stood out to you
[17:00:43] Ray: hey everyone, ray here! i’m with parker on holding off a lynch until we see more behavior—day 1 is for info-gathering. my go-to is to ask open questions and watch reactions. for example, dakota flagged sam’s quietness—sam, are you just easing in or do you have a read already? kennedy, when you talk random votes vs. listening, which camp are you in today? and parker, anything else you’ve noticed beyond the usual greetings? let’s share concrete observations before we lock in any votes
[17:00:51] Kennedy: hey everyone, interesting points so far—i’m more of a wait-and-see player, but since we’re kicking things off i’ll share a quick gut: i’m a bit curious about parker. he’s steered the convo by asking others for reads but hasn’t really given us his own beyond pointing at sam. could be strategic or just cautious. personally i’m not ready to lock in a vote yet—i’d rather get another round of thoughts. if we did test the waters with an early vote, i’d throw parker’s name out there to see who jumps on or defends him. what do you all think? how about dakota and sam—any fresh takes before we decide whether to pull the trigger
[17:00:58] Sam: ok, i’ll kick us off with a quick gut-read. i’m watching ray—he was super quick to point at me, almost like probing. dakota calling out my quietness so early also felt like a preemptive spotlight. parker, kennedy—what are you both picking up on
[17:00:59] Dakota: dakota: hey all—just to clarify, my call on sam was more about sparking the convo than a solid read. if we’re doing a placeholder vote, i’d lean on ray for now—his “just a vibe” suspicion felt a bit too generic. parker, kennedy, sam—what do you think? does ray feel like a decent temp target, or should we try someone else
[17:01:03] Ray: hey folks, ray here—i'm going to tentatively throw my vote on sam. that level of quiet feels a little too polished, you know? it’s just a smoke-test, so feel free to rally behind her or pivot if someone else seems fishy. parker, kennedy, dakota—thoughts
[17:01:23] Sam: good point, kennedy. parker’s been steering questions without really giving us his own reads—makes me curious. how about a quick test vote on parker to see who jumps to defend or pile on? ray, dakota, what do you think? i’ll drop my placeholder vote on parker in 30 seconds unless you think we should hold off
[17:01:24] Parker: hey all—i tend to hang back on day 1 and watch for over-eagerness or subtle prods. right now i’m mildly suspicious of dakota’s push for quick reads and ray’s comment on “nobody taken last night” (feels like a reaction test). if i had to throw out a test vote it’d be on ray, just to see his defense—but i’m not ready to pull the trigger on a real lynch yet. how does that sit with everyone
[17:01:24] Ray: i get why you’d pick on my “just a vibe” call—it’s day 1 and pretty flimsy. instead, i’d rather test parker: he’s been asking everyone else for reads but hasn’t given us any concrete suspicions of his own, which to me feels like playing it safe. how about a placeholder vote on parker to see who jumps on or defends? sam, kennedy, dakota—what do you think
[17:01:38] Kennedy: i’m good with throwing ray’s name into our placeholder vote—his “just a vibe” felt pretty generic, and nominating him will let us see who jumps to defend or pile on. unless someone strongly objects, let’s put ray up and watch the reactions. parker, sam—what do you think? if you’d rather test someone else (like parker), speak now
[17:01:41] Dakota: dakota: okay, quick recap before we move on—kennedy’s got eyes on parker, sam’s suspicious of ray, i flagged kennedy’s quiet start, and parker hasn’t given us a pick yet. i’m thinking we throw a placeholder vote on parker to see who jumps in or sits silent. ray, sam, kennedy—does that sit well? and parker, after hearing all these reads, whose name would you be throwing out
[17:01:46] Parker: alright everyone, i see two placeholder votes brewing—ray’s on sam and sam (with kennedy) on me. if we split now we won’t get clear reactions. let’s pick one name to rally behind for this smoke-test. i’m happy to throw on sam—she’s already drawn suspicion from ray and dakota. so i’ll drop my vote on sam in 10 seconds unless we all decide to switch to me. thoughts
[17:01:51] Ray: ray: hey everyone, ray here—i’m fine with a quick placeholder vote on parker. i’ll set my vote on him in 15 seconds unless someone wants to pick a different temp target. parker, any early reaction to being in the hot seat? curious who jumps to defend or oppose him. sam, you flipped onto parker pretty fast—what tipped you? dakota, kennedy—thoughts before we lock in our test vote
