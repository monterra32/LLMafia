[17:00:21] Ray: hey everyone, ray here! pumped for day 1. interesting nobody got taken last night—mafia must be laying low. to break the ice, let’s each share a quick gut feel on someone. i’m mildly suspicious of sam—just a vibe. what about you all? parker? kennedy? dakota
[17:00:43] Ray: hey everyone, ray here! i’m with parker on holding off a lynch until we see more behavior—day 1 is for info-gathering. my go-to is to ask open questions and watch reactions. for example, dakota flagged sam’s quietness—sam, are you just easing in or do you have a read already? kennedy, when you talk random votes vs. listening, which camp are you in today? and parker, anything else you’ve noticed beyond the usual greetings? let’s share concrete observations before we lock in any votes
[17:01:03] Ray: hey folks, ray here—i'm going to tentatively throw my vote on sam. that level of quiet feels a little too polished, you know? it’s just a smoke-test, so feel free to rally behind her or pivot if someone else seems fishy. parker, kennedy, dakota—thoughts
[17:01:24] Ray: i get why you’d pick on my “just a vibe” call—it’s day 1 and pretty flimsy. instead, i’d rather test parker: he’s been asking everyone else for reads but hasn’t given us any concrete suspicions of his own, which to me feels like playing it safe. how about a placeholder vote on parker to see who jumps on or defends? sam, kennedy, dakota—what do you think
[17:01:51] Ray: ray: hey everyone, ray here—i’m fine with a quick placeholder vote on parker. i’ll set my vote on him in 15 seconds unless someone wants to pick a different temp target. parker, any early reaction to being in the hot seat? curious who jumps to defend or oppose him. sam, you flipped onto parker pretty fast—what tipped you? dakota, kennedy—thoughts before we lock in our test vote
[17:03:44] Ray: alright, only dakota, kennedy and me left—let’s get concrete reads. i’m still a bit wary of kennedy: you flagged me on day 1 with that “just a vibe” line and then quieted right up. dakota, you’ve been chatty but curious—if you had to vote right now, who would you pick? kennedy, same to you. i’m going to tentatively vote kennedy to see how she defends. kennedy, anything you want to say before i lock that in? dakota, where are you leaning
[17:04:14] Ray: alright, quick recap: parker was lynched and sam went last night, so it’s down to you two. i’m still uneasy about dakota’s early push for those quick gut reads—they felt strategic and didn’t really hold up under questioning. unless i hear a compelling defense, i’m casting my vote for dakota. kennedy, where do you stand on this, and dakota, how do you explain your day 1 tactics
[17:05:11] Ray: kennedy, you’ve criticized my “generic vibes,” but you haven’t pointed to a single concrete slip—no timeline inconsistency, no logical misstep—in my play. that’s because you’re spinning suspicion out of thin air. dakota’s observations, by contrast, have been clear and evidence-based: quiet reads, placeholder tests, genuine follow-ups. that’s how bystanders investigate—test, observe, adapt. my smoke-tests on sam then parker were exactly that. kennedy, last chance to produce any tangible evidence of my guilt or accept this vote. i’m locking in on you. dakota, you ready to finish this
