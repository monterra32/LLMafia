[12:27:35] Peyton: hey everyone—peyton here! we made it through night one unscathed, which probably means the mafia are lying low. who’s struck you as either a bit too eager to point fingers or unusually quiet? i’d love to hear everyone’s gut feelings before we start throwing out names
[12:28:07] Peyton: hey everyone, peyton here—super excited for day 1! i totally agree it’s way too early to lock in a lynch with zero solid info. i’d rather hear more voices before we vote. so far we’ve only heard from angel and river, so i’d love to get a quick gut hunch from someone quieter—anyone? even a one-word vibe is fine! let’s get those early instincts on the table
[12:28:31] Peyton: hey everyone—just taking stock of the hunch list and noticing three names popping up more than once: kai, rowan, and gray. to help us dig a bit deeper, could each of you share one specific moment or line that set off your sus radar? that way we’ll know if there’s real weight behind these early vibes before we start voting
[12:29:19] Peyton: hey everyone—tons of good but tangled threads here. to clear things up, can kai, rowan, gray and ziggy each drop one quick line on the exact moment or wording that set off your sus radar? once we’ve got that, let’s run a fast straw-poll to see if any name really sticks. i’m happy to tally the results and will share my read after you all. sound like a plan
[12:29:46] Peyton: hey all—wanted to clear up exactly what i wrote so we’re not working off vague vibes:

1) “we made it through night one unscathed, which probably means the mafia are lying low.”  
2) “who’s struck you as either a bit too eager to point fingers or unusually quiet? i’d love to hear everyone’s gut feelings before we start throwing out names.”

river, your “would love to hear your thoughts before we start voting” is pretty similar—was that echo intentional or just coincidence? logan, you flagged me for “not chiming in yet” even though i replied right after angel—what exact line did you see? 

i’m also seeing kai, logan and rowan each pop up multiple times across lists—could the three of you share the exact snippet that put you on someone’s radar? let’s get those side by side so we can tighten up our top sus picks before we vote
[12:30:25] Peyton: hey everyone—just to be crystal clear, here are my two original lines:

1) “we made it through night one unscathed, which probably means the mafia are lying low.”  
2) “who’s struck you as either a bit too eager to point fingers or unusually quiet? i’d love to hear everyone’s gut feelings before we start throwing out names.”

river, that echo was pure coincidence—i always open that way. logan, you flagged me for “not chiming in yet” in your post at 12:27:36, but i’d already replied at 12:27:35—easy timestamp mix. kai, could you paste the exact wording where you spotted my slip so we can all see it?

with that cleared up, here are my top two day-1 suspects:  
1. kai  
2. rowan
[12:30:50] Peyton: hey everyone—i see the votes piling on me, so let me be crystal clear: my “mafia are lying low” line was pure speculation, not some secret collusion with river (that phrasing is literally her go-to opener). i’ve answered every request for clarification, while kai has been flagged by quinn, winter, river and others for radio silence and hasn’t offered a real defense. i’m a bystander who wants to find the real scum, so unless you have concrete proof against me, please consider redirecting your vote to kai or holding until we dig up something stronger. a day 1 mislynch on a fellow bystander would hurt us all
[12:31:15] Peyton: peyton: vote 1. kai – radio silence plus no clear defense when called out on logan’s slip feels far more telling than my phrasing; 2. rowan – that sudden swipe at gray was a knee-jerk pivot with no fresh evidence. let’s lock in kai and move this lynch forward
