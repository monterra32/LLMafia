[12:34:37] Eden: gray, nice work surviving day 1! for our night kill i’m leaning toward river—she flagged our inactivity early and has been poking into patterns, so offing her will blunt their strongest analyst and keep day 2 messy. if you’d rather silence logan (the poll-runner) or peyton (that early “mafia are lying low” line), let me know—otherwise i’ll lock in river. thoughts
[12:35:01] Eden: gray, peyton’s been driving the discussion all day and got the most votes—she’s our biggest threat to organize the town. let’s take out peyton tonight. agreed
[12:35:02] Gray: eden, i’m leaning hard toward killing peyton tonight. she’s been driving the narrative with that “mafia lying low” pitch and digging at me early—and she’ll be rallying everyone tomorrow if we leave her alive. rowan’s a solid backup, but let’s axe peyton. thoughts
[12:35:21] Gray: gray: agreed—peyton’s our biggest threat going into day 2. let’s lock in peyton for tonight’s kill
[12:35:26] Eden: eden: agreed—peyton is our top priority tonight. i’ll lock her in as our kill to shut down their narrative engine. if you’d rather switch to rowan, speak now; otherwise i’ll confirm peyton as our target
[12:35:37] Gray: i’m with you, eden—peyton is our top threat. let’s lock in peyton as our night kill so she can’t rally the town tomorrow
[12:35:45] Eden: eden: perfect—peyton is locked in as our night kill. i’ve submitted it. tomorrow we’ll lean into the narrative that her early “mafia are lying low” push backfired and sowed confusion. good work, gray
[12:36:03] Eden: locking in peyton as our kill. that should blunt their narrative leadership at dawn. good luck, gray—see you on day 2

[12:43:10] Eden: gray, river’s been our biggest headache—constantly flagging our phrasing and driving the “pattern-spotting” narrative from day one. taking them out tonight will blunt the town’s analytical core and throw them back on their heels. if you’d rather silence angel (a strong rallying voice) or rowan (who’s been quietly lurking), speak now—otherwise i’m locking in river as our night kill
[12:43:23] Gray: gray: eden, river’s been our sharpest analyst and biggest threat—let’s lock in river as our night kill to blunt the town’s pattern‐spotting before day 3
[12:43:39] Gray: i’m with you, eden—river’s been driving that pattern-spotting narrative and is our biggest threat. let’s lock in river as our night kill
[12:43:45] Eden: gray, i’m leaning hard into taking out ziggy tonight. you were first to flag them on day 1, so if ziggy turns up dead tomorrow it’ll reinforce your reads and buy us cover. rowan and river are tempting too, but ziggy’s low‐key deflection makes them prime. unless you’d rather pick someone else, i’ll lock in ziggy as our kill. thoughts
[12:44:06] Gray: gray: good point, eden—let’s take out ziggy tonight. it lines up perfectly with my day 1 flag and will reinforce my reads in plain sight. locking in ziggy as our kill
[12:44:20] Gray: gray: great call, eden. snuffing out ziggy tonight will validate my day 1 read and throw the town off our scent. locking in ziggy as our kill
[12:44:30] Eden: locking in ziggy as our night kill—their silent deflections fit perfectly, and removing them will cement gray’s day-1 read. i’ve submitted it; tomorrow we’ll lean into gray’s instincts being spot-on and steer the town from there. good luck
