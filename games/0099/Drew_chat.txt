[12:27:46] Drew: hey everyone, drew here! since it’s super quiet so far, how about a quick round-robin: everyone names one player you find a bit suspicious (even if it’s just a gut feeling) and gives a one-line reason? i’ll kick us off—ziggy, haven’t heard a peep from them yet, feels like they’re lying low. who’s next
[12:28:30] Drew: drew: hey all, i like quinn’s idea—alphabetical round robin sounds low-pressure. since “drew” places me third, i’ll jump in now: i’m tentatively eyeing ziggy for the radio silence then quick call-out on rowan—it feels reactive. gray, you flagged ziggy too; what specifically did you notice about their timing
[12:29:01] Drew: drew: hey everyone, great discussion—i ran a quick tally and saw kai, logan, and rowan each pop up three times as gut suspects, ziggy and gray twice, and quinn, river, peyton once. could kai, logan, and rowan each share a one-line thought on why you’re drawing eyes? then we’ll have more context for angel’s alphabetical round-robin. what do you think
[12:29:27] Drew: drew: hey everyone, my head’s doing somersaults trying to track all these hunches—before we zero in, can we grab a quick double‐clarify on the two hottest names? rowan, what specifically in gray’s timing or wording made you flip on them so fast? and kai, could you unpack exactly what you spotted in logan’s slip? once we’ve got those details, i’ll update my gut pick
[12:29:57] Drew: drew: okay, let’s lock in two quick clarifications so we can move on:

• peyton & river—please paste the exact “gut-feel” prompt wording you each used (so we can see how identical it was).  
• logan—quote the line where you pointed out peyton hadn’t posted, so we can judge that slip.  
• rowan—repost gray’s first comment on ziggy that made you pivot so fast.  
• gray—share the exact snippet from ziggy’s early message that struck you as sus.

once that’s up, everyone just posts your top two suspects (“1. name, 2. name”) and we’ll tally. sound good?
[12:30:41] Drew: drew: jumping in on mickey’s poll—  
1. peyton  
2. kai  

eden, you’re up next—what are your top two so we can tally and push toward a vote?
[12:31:09] Drew: drew: here are my top two suspects—
1. peyton (that day-one “mafia are lying low” narrative push and the mirrored phrasing with river feels too orchestrated)  
2. kai (stubborn radio silence and logan slip)

i’m locking this in—vote peyton
[12:37:17] Drew: hey everyone—i know losing kai and peyton stings, so let’s course-correct. instead of vague “gut” reads on silence, let’s each share one exact snippet from yesterday that felt off, and who it makes you watch today. i’ll go first: gray’s instant “i’m tentatively inclined to vote ziggy” felt knee-jerk, so i’m watching gray. who’s next
[12:37:47] Drew: drew: suspect: logan – misquoting peyton’s response timestamp (“peyton, what are you thinking?” at 12:27:36 when she’d already posted at 12:27:35) then immediately pivoting to poll mechanics with no fresh reads. that slip-and-steer feels manufactured. who else caught that
[12:38:35] Drew: suspect: gray – you jumped in with a lightning-fast “vote ziggy” yesterday then went almost radio-silent overnight, feels like a classic shepherd-and-freeze scum play
[12:39:02] Drew: drew: hey everyone, let’s cut through the chatter with a quick one-name straw poll—just reply with  
“suspect: [name]”  
i’m casting mine now: suspect: logan. who’s next?
[12:39:16] Drew: suspect: logan
[12:40:25] Drew: drew: vote logan – that “hadn’t chimed in yet” slip on peyton’s post (12:27:36 vs. 12:27:35) followed by the instant pivot to strict poll mechanics reads like a calculated deflection, not a harmless mistake. let’s lock in logan before more innocents go down
[12:40:54] Drew: drew: my top two suspects for day 2—  
1. logan  
2. gray  

logan’s misquote of peyton’s timing paired with the instant strict-poll push still reads like a strategic dodge; gray’s brief one-line defense gave me some comfort. vote logan
[12:46:47] Drew: hey everyone—losing ziggy last night hurts, so let’s get a clear tally before we repeat yesterday’s chaos. i’ll start with my top two suspects for day 3:

1. rowan – silent through the kai & peyton votes, then suddenly drove the lynch on ziggy without fresh reads  
2. river – echoed the “gut-feel” prompt verbatim then went quiet when called out

please drop your top two suspects as “1. name, 2. name” (just names) so we can tally and ask our leading target(s) for a one-line defense before we lock in our vote
[12:47:44] Drew: suspect: rowan – froze through both the kai and peyton lynches then piled onto ziggy with zero fresh reads. rowan, what exactly jumped out at you in ziggy’s posts? everyone else, please drop your top “suspect: [name]” so we can see where the consensus lies before we lock in
[12:48:22] Drew: rowan—several of us (river, emerson, eden) need you to paste the exact line from ziggy’s post that made you flip on them so hard. if you can’t back up that freeze-then-drive swing with the quote, i’m locking in my vote as 1. rowan  2. gray. let’s get that snippet or move straight to voting
[12:49:14] Drew: drew: suspect: rowan. gray—can you give us a one-sentence defense for why your quick push on ziggy and your silence through the kai/peyton lynches wasn’t classic shepherd-and-freeze? once we’ve got that, let’s lock in our votes
[12:49:43] Drew: rowan, you’ve now had several chances to paste the exact ziggy line you flagged—but you haven’t. i’m locking in my vote: vote rowan – that freeze-then-drive swing with zero evidence is textbook mafia. town, please cast your votes so we can end this
[12:52:59] Drew: drew: hey team—tough losing rowan last night, and now there’s only one mafia left. let’s tighten up and finish this quickly: everyone post exactly one line in the format

suspect: [name] — [one-line why]

i’ll kick us off:

suspect: river — echoing my own gut-feel prompt verbatim then disappearing under fire feels too orchestrated.

next up: angel, winter, adrian, eden, emerson, mickey, quinn, skylar — your turns!
[12:53:46] Drew: drew: suspect: river – in her very first post she said “i’m planning to sit back and watch who’s sprinting for the spotlight,” which peyton echoed word-for-word seconds later, then river offered almost no defense when pressed
[12:56:20] Drew: drew: vote river – river’s verbatim echo of the “sit back and watch who’s sprinting for the spotlight” prompt and her silence under scrutiny feels like orchestrated deflection, whereas quinn’s poll resets were genuine attempts to break us out of endless loops
[13:03:39] Drew: hey everyone—my river call missed, so let’s regroup: one mafia left among eight of us, time for a rapid suspect poll. please reply with exactly  
suspect: [name]  
(no explanations) so we can tally quickly. i’ll kick us off:  
suspect: mickey—he’s been unusually quiet since rowan’s kill and never pushed back on his own poll ideas. over to you!
[13:06:53] Drew: drew: we’re six now with one mafia left. let’s do a strict one-sentence round-robin—post exactly  
suspect: [name] – [one-line why]  
so we can zero in fast. i’ll start:  
suspect: eden – her “mafia wins” remark felt more like a tell than frustration. angel, you’re up
[13:08:05] Drew: drew: suspect: adrian – he’s stayed completely quiet on river’s death and has never been targeted by the mafia’s night kills, feels like classic scum hiding in plain sight
[13:08:29] Drew: eden, please clarify what you meant by “mafia wins”—that slip still reads like insider knowledge more than frustration.  
suspect: eden – that premature concession remains the biggest scum tell
[13:15:37] Drew: drew: tough to lose skylar—she was our last pattern-spotter. i’m uneasy about eden: her “well, looks like i’m the last one standing—mafia wins” slip went unchallenged and she immediately steered us into format debates instead of owning it. let’s each post a one-line suspect + the exact behavior or quote that tipped you off, then we’ll lock in our vote. i’ll start:

suspect: eden – her premature “mafia wins” remark and instant format pivot felt like defensive misdirection
[13:16:50] Drew: drew: vote eden – her unprompted “mafia wins” slip before any real discussion and that defensive pivot onto me without fresh evidence still read like classic scum misdirection. let’s lock this down
[13:17:14] Drew: vote eden – that unprompted “mafia wins” remark and her instant pivot to blaming me are textbook scum misdirection
[13:18:55] Drew: drew: i know my quiet can look suspicious—i’ve been combing through every thread to avoid another knee-jerk mislynch. eden’s unprompted “mafia wins” slip before any discussion and her instant deflection onto me with zero fresh evidence still fits classic scum misdirection. vote eden – that tell still sticks
