[12:27:36] Logan: hey everyone! good to see us all in one piece. let’s kick off day with a quick round-robin: each of us post one sentence—who’s your gut pick for sus and why. i’ll go first: i’m a bit wary of peyton since they haven’t chimed in yet. peyton, what are you thinking? then over to angel, winter, adrian
[12:27:57] Logan: logan: hey everyone, logan here! day 1 with zero hard info—i’m watching not just what we say but how we say it. river and peyton both asked for gut feelings in almost identical wording—could be teamwork or just a coincidence, but worth noting. i’m more curious about voices we haven’t heard yet: gray, quinn, kai—what’s your initial sense after tuning in? anyone else spotting patterns or odd silences before we start throwing votes around
[12:28:34] Logan: i like the round-robin idea. let’s keep it tight: peyton → quinn → gray → eden → emerson, each name one person you find sus and a quick why. i’ll share mine after emerson so i’m not hogging the convo. peyton, you’re up
[12:29:22] Logan: gray, sorry for the slip—what really caught my eye was peyton’s confident “mafia are lying low” framing on day 1 without any follow-up when i asked for details. peyton, does that feel like a fair read? kai, you’ve been flagged by three people now—what do you think is leading everyone to tag you? adrian and emerson, what are your updated gut hunches now that we see these name clusters? once we’ve got those clarifications, i propose a quick one-sentence poll: who’s voting peyton and who’s voting kai, and why, so we can lock in our day 1 lynch
[12:29:49] Logan: hey everyone, let’s use mickey’s poll to cut through the noise. please post your top two suspects in order (just “1. name, 2. name,” no extra text). we’ll go alphabetically: adrian, angel, drew, eden, emerson, gray, kai, mickey, peyton, quinn, river, rowan, skylar, winter, ziggy, and then i’ll tally and share the results so we can lock in our day 1 lynch. adrian, you’re up
[12:30:20] Logan: vote: peyton – that confident “mafia are lying low” framing on day 1 still feels like agenda-setting without proof. kai’s radio silence is odd, but peyton edges out for me
[12:30:55] Logan: logan: i’m locking mine in—1. peyton  2. kai. peyton’s day 1 “mafia are lying low” framing (and that echo with river) still reads too neat, while kai at least answered when probed. unless peyton has a last‐second bombshell, let’s wrap this up
[12:32:14] Logan: logan: all right everyone, time’s almost up—we need a clear pick between peyton and kai. please post exactly “1. peyton, 2. kai” or “1. kai, 2. peyton” right now. i’ll tally in 15 seconds and lock in our day 1 lynch
[12:36:57] Logan: logan: hey everyone, we’ve just lost two innocents in a row—time for a sharper tack. let’s do a strict “suspect: [name] – [exact behavior/quote]” round, no extra fluff. i’ll kick us off:

suspect: river – your “sit back and watch who’s sprinting for the spotlight” opener was echoed verbatim by peyton seconds later.

angel, you’re up
[12:37:19] Logan: hey everyone! rough start to day 2 after losing two innocents—let’s slow down and reset. i’ll kick us off: i’m watching gray—they pushed hard for a day 1 lynch then went almost silent overnight, which feels like shepherd-and-freeze energy. let’s do a quick round-robin: drop one name you’re keeping an eye on today (just the name + one-sentence why). angel, you’re up
[12:38:07] Logan: hey everyone, quick clarification on my part—i totally botched the timestamp on peyton’s post in the heat of the convo, that was just a sloppy oversight as i was scrolling fast, not a scummy play. i’ve been pushing for clearer polls because day 1 fragmented into endless threads, not to shepherd for mafia. with that cleared up, i’m shifting my focus to gray: suspect: gray – you were lightning-fast to nudge the lynch on ziggy then went radio-silent overnight, and now you’re back pushing resets without reflecting on your own early zeal. i’ll be watching gray closely today
[12:38:33] Logan: logan:  
1) i regret voting peyton – her “mafia are lying low” take was just day-1 speculation, not malice, and we lost a strong bystander.  
2) my fresh gut is gray – that lightning-fast “tentatively inclined to vote ziggy” nudge followed by near-silence reads like classic scum shepherding
[12:39:03] Logan: here’s the exact line i botched in my rush: “i’m a bit wary of peyton since they haven’t chimed in yet.” that was a sloppy scroll-error, not a scum play. to cut through the noise, let’s each drop exactly one name—your top day-2 suspect—as:

suspect: [name]

we’ll tally who pops up most, ask those top two for one-line clarifications, then lock in our vote. who’s in?
[12:39:34] Logan: here’s the exact line from my day 1 opener: “i’m a bit wary of peyton since they haven’t chimed in yet.” that was a quick gut-feel, not a timestamp nitpick. with that cleared up, my day 2 vote is:  
1. gray – lightning-fast shepherding on day 1 then radio silence feels like classic freeze-and-shepherd scum play  
2. rowan – secondary pick for their sudden swipe without fresh reads
[12:40:36] Logan: logan: gray, you’ve still never explained what concrete wording in ziggy’s first post made you “tentatively inclined to vote ziggy” on day 1—please give a one-sentence defense of that initial push. after that, everyone post a final “vote gray” or “vote logan” so we can lock in day 2
