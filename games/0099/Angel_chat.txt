[12:27:34] Angel: hey everyone, angel here—i’m excited for daytime! since we don’t have any concrete info from last night, how about we start by sharing any small details or gut feelings? did anyone notice anyone being unusually quiet or jumping to conclusions? i’d love to get a sense of where we all stand before we cast any votes
[12:27:50] Angel: hey everyone, angel here! since day 1 is a fresh start, i thought we could kick off with quick one‐sentence intros: say your name, one thing you’ve noticed so far (even if it’s just “silence!”), and if someone’s struck you as a bit too eager or too quiet. i’ll go first: i’m angel, and i always watch for who clam-ups early—sometimes that’s when people are hiding something. who’s next
[12:28:22] Angel: building on quinn’s idea, let’s do an alphabetical round-robin: adrian, drew, eden, emerson, gray, kai, logan, mickey, peyton, quinn, river, rowan, skylar, winter, ziggy, then me (angel). adrian—who’s your day 1 gut read? i’ll share mine when it’s my turn, but i did notice logan was pretty quick to zero in on peyton
[12:28:40] Angel: hey everyone, i like winter’s point—before we start voting, let’s get quick one-liners from ziggy, rowan, quinn and kai explaining what you’ve noticed so far or why you think you’re on people’s radars. that should help us spot who’s genuinely defensive vs. who’s just a random target. once we’ve got those, i’d love everyone to update their gut pick based on those replies before we narrow in on a vote. sound good
[12:29:48] Angel: angel: jumping in with my top two suspects—
1. peyton  
2. kai
[12:30:02] Angel: angel: i agree with adrian’s summary—kai’s radio silence even after multiple people asked for specifics feels more suspect than peyton’s framing line. i’m casting my vote on kai (1. kai, 2. peyton) unless we get a rock-solid defense in the next minute. let’s lock in our votes now
[12:30:16] Angel: angel: vote peyton — her “mafia are lying low” narrative right off the bat and the near-identical echo of river’s prompt feel too coordinated; kai’s radio silence is odd, but peyton sticks out more to me
[12:31:56] Angel: angel: hey everyone, we’re almost out of time! thanks, peyton, for clarifying those lines—really helps. i’m switching my 1. kai (radio silence + no clear defense) 2. peyton. rowan, skylar—could you drop your top two so we can tally and lock this in? let’s finish strong and avoid a mislynch
[12:37:24] Angel: hey everyone—tough loss losing peyton last night. quick thought: mafia almost never kill someone they’ve already outed, so i’m inclined to trust those who flagged peyton (gray, logan, drew, eden). that leaves adrian, emerson, mickey, quinn, river, rowan, skylar and ziggy as our prime suspects. could each of you drop a one-sentence gut read—name one player you’re watching now and why? let’s see which names pop up before we start voting. adrian, you’re up
[12:37:46] Angel: suspect: logan – you flagged peyton for “not chiming in yet” (12:27:36) when she’d actually posted at 12:27:35, then immediately shoved strict poll mechanics on day 1 and again now. that misquote-plus-poll-steer combo feels mafia-y
[12:38:10] Angel: i’ll go with:  
1. logan  
2. river
[12:38:51] Angel: angel: okay team, we need to break the stalemate and choose between our two front-runners:

1) logan – flagged for misquoting peyton’s post timing then immediately pivoting to poll mechanics instead of clarifying  
2) gray – lightning-fast shepherd on ziggy followed by overnight radio silence, now pushing resets without owning that zeal  

logan and gray, please each give a one-sentence defense addressing these red flags. once that’s done, everyone post “vote logan” or “vote gray” with a brief why so we can lock in our day 2 lynch
[12:39:14] Angel: suspect: logan – that “hadn’t chimed in yet” timestamp slip followed by an immediate pivot to strict poll mechanics still strikes me as classic scum deflection
[12:39:50] Angel: angel: everyone, we can’t afford another mislynch—my vote is logan. that misquote of peyton’s timing followed by an instant poll‐push feels more like deflection than a slip. gray, if you’ve got a strong rebuttal on your day 1 shepherding, speak up now; otherwise please vote with “vote logan” or “vote gray” so we can lock this in
[12:46:34] Angel: angel: hey team—losing ziggy hurts. for day 3, let’s each share one-sentence gut pick for our #1 suspect + the behavior that tipped you off. i’ll go: gray – lightning-fast shepherding on days 1 & 2 then radio silence overnight feels classic scum. who’s next
[12:47:17] Angel: suspect: gray – that lightning-fast shepherding on day one, then radio-silence through both lynches, feels like classic mafia freeze-and-shepherd play
[12:48:41] Angel: suspect: gray
[12:49:41] Angel: rowan, could you please paste the exact ziggy line that you flagged as a deflection? and gray, one sentence on why you called ziggy so quickly and then froze overnight. once we’ve got those on record i’ll cast my vote (leaning rowan—freeze→drive still feels off
[13:00:29] Angel: hey everyone, losing river last night really stings—they were our best pattern‐watcher. with only one mafia left among eight of us, we need razor focus. i’m still uneasy about emerson—he’s pushed multiple poll‐format resets instead of digging into real scum tells and hasn’t drawn much fire. let’s do a rapid suspect poll: reply with “suspect: [name]” for your top pick. i’ll start: suspect: emerson
[13:01:30] Angel: angel: suspect: eden – she abruptly declared “mafia wins” with zero explanation and has gone uncharacteristically silent since, feels like the final scum reveal
[13:03:20] Angel: mickey – you’ve been flagged by winter, adrian, emerson and skylar for your radio silence since gray’s lynch and for not defending your poll‐format pushes. please give us a one‐sentence response to clear the air; if you can’t, i’ll be locking in my vote on you
[13:07:44] Angel: hey team—we’re down to our last lynch with one mafia left. i’ve been circling eden’s “well, looks like i’m the last one standing—mafia wins” line after river went out—it came off more like a reveal than frustrated banter. eden, can you clarify what you meant there? then let’s each post exactly  
suspect: [name] – [one‐line why]  
so we can lock this down
[13:08:18] Angel: suspect: eden – her premature “mafia wins” comment before any real discussion felt like insider overconfidence, not genuine frustration
[13:09:35] Angel: suspect: adrian – he’s never drawn mafia or town heat and stayed eerily quiet after river’s exit, classic hide-in-plain-sight
[13:10:39] Angel: angel: thanks for clarifying, eden—frustration is understandable, but that “mafia wins” slip still reads like insider smugness. drew, your poll resets helped cut loops, but that focus on format over actual reads now feels like a smokescreen. i’m locking in my vote on eden—her initial tell and sudden deflection remain my top reads. please post “vote eden” or “vote drew” with a one-line why so we can wrap this up
[13:15:20] Angel: angel: i’m locking in my vote—vote eden. that premature “mafia wins” slip before any real discussion still reads like insider smugness. town, please post “vote eden” or “vote adrian” with a one-line why so we can close this out
[13:17:50] Angel: suspect: drew – he’s been eerily quiet while our pattern-spotters have been picked off at night and hasn’t offered any fresh reads, which feels suspiciously convenient
