[12:27:35] River: hey everyone, river here! day 1 is always tough with zero info, so i’m planning to sit back and watch who’s sprinting for the spotlight—sometimes that eagerness is a great distraction. what are your gut feelings after last night? anyone notice odd silence or a push to lynch someone early? would love to hear your thoughts before we start voting
[12:27:51] River: hey angel (and everyone)! river here. i haven’t spotted anyone super quiet yet, but i did notice kai hasn’t said much—could be deep in thought or laying low. and winter seemed quick to agree with angel—genuine or just bandwagoning, who knows? just early vibes from me. what are you all picking up so far
[12:28:14] River: river here—day 1 gut: logan was super quick to zero in on peyton without much reasoning, so i’m watching logan’s moves. on the flip side, ziggy and rowan have been almost radio-silent, which also strikes me as odd. that’s where i’m at for now—keen to see what others pick up on
[12:28:46] River: just to clear the air, i promise there’s no secret dodge in hanging back; i’m watching how names inevitably cluster. for example, kai’s been flagged by skylar, quinn, and winter—that’s more hits than anyone else so far. gray, you mentioned logan—logan, can you expand on what set off your alarm? peyton, does that sit right with you? and adrian or emerson, what are your gut hunches now that patterns are emerging
[12:29:58] River: hey team—just to clear the air on the “gut feelings” phrasing, peyton and i weren’t coordinating; that’s literally my go-to opener and i’m guessing peyton’s too. peyton, can you confirm that—and also walk us through what made you frame “mafia are lying low” so strongly on day 1? once we’ve got that quick clarification, let’s run a fast straw poll: peyton vs kai for our lynch. i’m leaning toward kai if peyton’s narrative doesn’t hold up, but i’ll adjust based on what she shares
[12:30:26] River: here’s my original wording:

“day 1 is always tough with zero info, so i’m planning to sit back and watch who’s sprinting for the spotlight—sometimes that eagerness is a great distraction. what are your gut feelings after last night? anyone notice odd silence or a push to lynch someone early? would love to hear your thoughts before we start voting.”

i’ll share my top two suspects once we’ve got everyone’s snippets side by side
[12:31:04] River: hey everyone, thanks for clarifying, peyton—that makes sense. kai, could you paste the exact logan slip you flagged so we can see it in context? once we’ve got that, i’m ready to lock in my vote:  
1. kai  
2. rowan  

and if anyone else hasn’t posted your top two suspects yet, please drop them now so we can wrap up this straw poll
[12:31:29] River: here’s my original “gut-feel” prompt pasted in full:

“day 1 is always tough with zero info, so i’m planning to sit back and watch who’s sprinting for the spotlight—sometimes that eagerness is a great distraction. what are your gut feelings after last night? anyone notice odd silence or a push to lynch someone early? would love to hear your thoughts before we start voting.”

with that clear, my top two suspects are:  
1. kai  
2. rowan  

casting my vote on kai unless someone drops a game-changing detail right now
[12:31:59] River: river: i’ve locked in mine as  
1. kai  
2. rowan  

adrian, rowan and skylar—please drop your top-two suspects in “1. name, 2. name” format asap so we can tally. kai, could you also paste the exact logan slip you flagged? once we’ve got those, we can finalize our day 1 lynch
[12:37:14] River: river: rough go yesterday—mislynched kai then lost peyton overnight. my day 2 gut is gray: driving votes early then dropping radio-silent feels like classic scum shepherding. angel, adrian, drew—what’s your top pick and why
[12:37:58] River: river: i like skylar’s rapid hunch poll to keep things moving. i’m most suspicious of logan—misquoting peyton’s post timing (“hadn’t chimed in yet”) felt like a deflection. now let’s each drop one name you’re eyeing right now (no why) and i’ll tally the top suspects for quick one-line defenses before we vote
[12:38:19] River: suspect: gray
[12:38:43] River: river: 1. gray, 2. logan
[12:39:03] River: logan, could you please paste the exact line where you flagged peyton for “not chiming in”? we need to see it in context. once that’s up, let’s settle our day 2 lynch—please reply “1. logan” to vote you out or “2. gray” to vote gray. i’ll tally immediately
[12:40:11] River: i’m casting my vote for logan—his “hadn’t chimed in yet” timestamp slip followed by that instant poll-steer still reads like deliberate deflection, not an honest mistake. let’s lock this in and move forward
[12:40:35] River: river: vote logan – that slip accusing peyton of “not chiming in yet” paired with an instant push for strict poll mechanics still reads like a calculated deflection; gray’s early “vote ziggy” shepherd-and-freeze was sketchy, but logan’s play sticks out more
[12:46:47] River: suspect: rowan – you were radio-silent through the kai and peyton lynches, then popped up to push ziggy with no fresh reads; that freeze-then-drive swing feels like classic scum play
[12:47:09] River: river: 1. gray  
2. rowan
[12:48:06] River: suspect: rowan
[12:49:33] River: vote rowan – your silence through the kai and peyton lynches followed by a sudden spearhead on ziggy with no fresh reads is textbook scum shepherd-and-freeze behavior
[12:50:12] River: hey team—rowan, you’ve still not pasted the exact ziggy line you flagged, and without that proof your sudden freeze→drive swing looks like deflection. i’m locking in my vote: 1. rowan, 2. gray. if you agree, please vote rowan now so we can wrap this up before another innocent falls
[12:52:42] River: let’s cut the chatter and lock this down—everyone drop exactly one suspect as:

suspect: [name]

(no extras). i’ll go first:

suspect: quinn
[12:53:23] River: river: thanks for kicking off the poll, emerson. i’ve been fully transparent—dropping quotes and clarifications on demand—so it makes sense the mafia would try to frame me first. suspect: emerson – he’s been driving rapid format resets and pointed the finger at me right out of the gate
[12:54:15] River: defense – that “sit back and watch who’s sprinting for the spotlight” opener is literally my go-to day 1 icebreaker, not a coded mafia cue.  
suspect: quinn – he’s been more obsessed with poll mechanics than digging into evidence and went eerily quiet when ziggy was flagged, textbook scum freeze-and-shepherd
[12:54:59] River: hey team—addressing eden’s point, that “sit back and watch who’s sprinting for the spotlight” line is literally my go-to icebreaker every game, so peyton echoing it was pure coincidence, not a secret code. now, my fresh gut pick is quinn—pushing this suspect-quote format feels more like controlling the convo than genuine reads. quinn, what behavior drove you to propose that round-robin? and does anyone else have a top hunch to share before we vote
[12:55:51] River: quinn, please give us a one-sentence defense for why you steered us into suspect-quote polls and then went eerily quiet when ziggy’s echo was exposed. after that, i’m casting my vote:  
vote quinn – hyper-focus on process over proof reads like classic scum behavior
