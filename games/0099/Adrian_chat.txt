[12:27:51] Adrian: hey everyone! adrian here. day 1 has just kicked off and with zero clues on the table it’s tough to narrow anyone down. how about we each toss out one quick gut feel—name someone you find a bit fishy so far and a brief why (no need for deep analysis yet). i’ll start: i don’t have a real read yet, but i’ll be watching for anyone who’s over-eager to follow the crowd later on. peyton, quinn—what are your gut reads
[12:28:07] Adrian: adrian: hey everyone, adrian here! i don’t have a rock-solid read yet but i did notice gray was quick to call out ziggy—feels a bit rushed for day 1. i’ll keep my eye on that. who’s next
[12:28:30] Adrian: i’m noticing both kai and rowan have picked up multiple mentions so far. rowan at least gave a reason for eyeing gray, but kai’s only said logan slipped up—no follow-up. kai, can you expand on what you saw there? and rowan, what do you make of all these other names getting tossed around? i’m slightly leaning toward kai right now, but want to hear your takes before we lock anything in
[12:28:55] Adrian: hey everyone, adrian here. for my day 1 gut pick i’m watching gray—they were quick to zero in on ziggy without much explanation, then pivoted over to logan with no fresh reasoning. gray, could you unpack what tipped you on ziggy’s timing and phrasing, and what made you switch targets? drew, you’re up next
[12:29:18] Adrian: adrian: i’m still torn between rowan, peyton and kai—those threads keep looping back. gray, can you point to the exact phrasing in ziggy’s first post that struck you as reflexively sus? and peyton, what made you lead with the “mafia lying low” narrative so early? once we have those specifics, i’ll lock in my gut pick
[12:29:48] Adrian: i think logan’s right that we’ve boiled this down to peyton vs. kai. here’s where i stand:

• peyton’s “mafia are lying low” framing felt like agenda-setting, but they’ve at least engaged with follow-ups.  
• kai’s been flagged three times for radio silence and hasn’t given us much beyond “i’m watching.”  

i’m tentatively voting kai unless we get a strong last-minute defense. peyton and kai—one quick line each to clarify your reads or explain any misfires—then everyone please post your vote (kai or peyton) with a one-line why. let’s lock this in
[12:30:56] Adrian: okay, let’s lock down the exact quotes before we vote:

1. peyton—paste your “we made it through night one unscathed…” line and your gut-feel prompt.  
2. river—paste your original gut-feel prompt wording.  
3. logan—quote where you said peyton hadn’t chimed in yet.  
4. rowan—repost gray’s very first comment on ziggy.  
5. gray—share the snippet from ziggy’s first post that struck you as knee-jerk.

once those are side-by-side, everyone post your top two suspects (“1. name, 2. name”). i’m currently at 1. kai, 2. peyton, but i’ll adjust if these quotes don’t support our suspicions
[12:31:30] Adrian: adrian:  
1. kai  
2. peyton  

river, rowan, skylar and mickey—please drop your top two suspects so we can tally and lock in our day 1 lynch
[12:31:49] Adrian: adrian:  
1. kai – still waiting on that exact logan slip and the radio-silence feels more telling than peyton’s framing  
2. peyton – her “mafia are lying low” push was bold but she’s at least clarified it, so she drops to #2
[12:37:06] Adrian: adrian: tough break losing peyton—she had great instincts. let’s regroup: can everyone drop a one-sentence gut hunch on who you’re watching now and why? i’ll go first: i’m still watching logan for that early slip on peyton’s timing. over to you all
[12:37:43] Adrian: adrian: i’m with eden—my day-2 gut pick is logan. that misquote of peyton’s post (claiming she hadn’t chimed in when she did) felt like a deliberate steer, and he immediately pivoted us to poll mechanics instead of unpacking it. gray’s shepherding is still on my radar as a close second. drew, angel—what’s your read
[12:37:56] Adrian: 1. gray  
2. logan
[12:38:38] Adrian: adrian:  
1) i regret voting out kai — she was picking up on patterns and could’ve helped us course-correct on day 1.  
2) suspect: logan — misquoting peyton’s post timing then instantly shoving us into strict poll mechanics feels like a deliberate deflection
[12:40:20] Adrian: suspect: gray  – that lightning-fast “tentatively inclined to vote ziggy” push followed by near-total silence overnight still reads like classic shepherd-and-freeze. gray, can you give a one-sentence defense of your early zeal and subsequent radio-silence before i lock in my vote
[12:40:42] Adrian: gray, i’d still like that one‐sentence defense you promised for your lightning‐fast day 1 shepherding (“tentatively inclined to vote ziggy”) and subsequent radio silence—if it doesn’t land, i’m locking in logan. his “hadn’t chimed in yet” slip and instant poll–push remain the clearest tell for me
[12:41:14] Adrian: adrian: vote logan – that “haven’t chimed in yet” slip paired with the instant pivot to strict poll mechanics still reads like calculated deflection, not an honest mistake
[12:46:58] Adrian: adrian: hey everyone, rough losing ziggy overnight—let’s keep this fast and focused. i’m on board with gray and mickey’s suspect‐poll: just reply  
suspect: [name]  
(one name only) and we’ll tally who pops up most, then ask the top two for one‐sentence defenses before we vote. i’ll kick us off:  
suspect: rowan — silent through kai and peyton votes, then resurfaced hard on ziggy. your turn!
[12:47:33] Adrian: 1. rowan, 2. river
[12:48:25] Adrian: hey team—thanks for all the rapid hunches. it looks like rowan (4 flags) and gray (3 flags) are our top suspects. rowan, you were silent through kai’s and peyton’s lynches then jumped on ziggy—can you give us one sentence explaining that swing? gray, you led the lightning-fast ziggy push then stayed quiet overnight—one sentence on your reasoning there? once we’ve got those, let’s each post “vote rowan” or “vote gray” with a one-line why so we can lock in our day 3 lynch
[12:48:50] Adrian: rowan, could you please paste the exact ziggy line you referenced—word-for-word—that echoed river’s gut-feel prompt? i’m not seeing the match in the posts. unless we get that snippet now, i’m ready to vote 1. rowan  2. gray to keep us from stalling
[12:49:46] Adrian: vote rowan – that freeze-then-drive on ziggy with no concrete quote to back it up is a classic scum shepherd-and-freeze play, and rowan hasn’t provided the exact line they claimed
[12:52:59] Adrian: hey everyone—losing rowan last night really stings, but we know there’s only one mafia left among us. let’s keep this tight: please each post exactly  
suspect: [name]  
(just the name, no why). we’ll tally the top two picks, ask each for a one-sentence defense, then lock in our lynch. sound good?
[12:53:44] Adrian: suspect: river — echoing the “sit back and watch who’s sprinting for the spotlight” prompt verbatim then vanishing under pressure reads like a scripted deflection
[12:55:53] Adrian: vote quinn – hyper-focused on poll mechanics over actual evidence and eerily silent when ziggy’s echo was flagged, feels like a classic deflection
[12:57:05] Adrian: adrian: vote quinn – river’s go-to icebreaker line and detailed defense check out, whereas quinn’s poll-first push and silence under fire still read like a classic scum misdirection
[12:59:30] Adrian: hey everyone, losing river stings but we’ve got one mafia left—time to finish strong. let’s do a lightning-fast hunch poll: everyone post exactly

suspect: [name]

(just the name). i’ll start:  
suspect: mickey—he’s been unusually quiet since ziggy’s lynch and hasn’t defended his own poll proposals. go!
[13:00:31] Adrian: 1. mickey  
2. river
[13:01:51] Adrian: suspect: mickey
[13:02:24] Adrian: suspect: mickey – he’s been conspicuously quiet through the last few lynches and keeps pivoting us into format debates instead of digging into real scum tells
[13:07:05] Adrian: hey everyone—now that mickey’s out and only one mafia remains, we need to zero in fast. eden, you said “mafia wins” before the game even ended—can you clarify what you meant by that? while we wait, let’s each post exactly one line in this format:

suspect: [name] – [one-line why]

i’ll start:  
suspect: eden – that premature concession felt more like an insider slip than just frustration. who’s next?
[13:07:35] Adrian: suspect: eden – her “mafia wins” comment came off like scummy overconfidence rather than genuine frustration, making it feel more like a tell than a slip of a bystander
[13:09:20] Adrian: adrian: i’m still convinced eden is our mafia—that unprompted “mafia wins” remark before any real discussion felt like insider gloating, not frustration. eden, please explain what you meant by that; otherwise i’m locking in vote eden to avoid another overnight kill
