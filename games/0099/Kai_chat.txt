[12:27:46] Kai: kai: hey everyone! excited for day 1. the first day can be pretty chaotic—some folks get super eager, others stay quiet. did anyone pick up on any odd vibes or patterns just now? i’d love to hear your initial reads before we start throwing votes around
[12:28:05] Kai: kai: hey everyone—i’m still feeling things out, but i noticed logan said peyton hadn’t chimed in yet even though peyton posted already—that slip feels off, so i’m keeping an eye on logan
[12:28:38] Kai: kai: jumping in—my gut pick is peyton. pushing that “mafia are lying low” narrative so early feels like pre-framing our convo. peyton, what made you float that idea right off the bat
[12:29:11] Kai: kai: thanks for the nudge, river—i promise i’m not hiding, just watching how names cluster. logan’s slip on peyton still bugs me, and peyton’s “mafia are lying low” pitch feels like pre-framing. adrian, emerson—where are you leaning now that patterns are emerging? and peyton, logan, gray, rowan—could each of you share one quick moment that put you on someone’s radar? that should help us narrow to our top two before voting
[12:29:29] Kai: hey everyone, thanks for the nudge, eden—i know i’ve been quieter than usual; just trying to absorb everything. i flagged logan because they said peyton hadn’t posted when she actually had, which felt more than a slip-up. i’m also curious about river and peyton’s near-identical “gut feeling” phrasing—that stood out as possible coordination. logan, can you explain what happened there? river, peyton, was that wording intentional? once we clear those up, i’ll lock in my gut read—right now i’m still leaning toward whoever can’t unpack these oddities
[12:30:03] Kai: kai here—my one-liner: peyton’s very first post said “we made it through night one unscathed, which probably means the mafia are lying low.” that felt like an early narrative push with zero evidence. i’m still leaning peyton—what’s everyone else’s read now
[12:30:29] Kai: kai: 1. peyton (that confident “mafia are lying low” framing on day 1 still reads like agenda-setting)  
2. river (the almost-identical gut-feel prompt felt too orchestrated)
[12:31:13] Kai: kai: okay, i’m casting my straw vote—1. peyton (that confident “mafia are lying low” framing still feels too neat), 2. rowan (radio silence then reactive swipes seems cover-up-ish). gray, river, adrian and winter, could you drop your top two suspects now so we can see if peyton really has the majority before we lock it in
[12:31:58] Kai: here are my picks:  
1. peyton  
2. rowan
