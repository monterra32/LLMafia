[11:43:10] Parker: i’m a bit suspicious of sam’s quick question—anyone else pick up on that
[11:43:13] Kennedy: parker’s been awfully quiet—what’s your top suspect so far

[11:43:21] Kennedy: sam’s quick suspicion of parker feels like a convenient distraction
[11:43:21] Sam: parker, care to explain why you’ve been so quiet
[11:43:25] Parker: ray and dakota, what exactly did i say that’s more suspicious than anyone else
[11:43:33] Kennedy: parker, what about sam’s quick question makes you suspect them
[11:43:41] Ray: sam, why are you so quick to accuse parker
[11:43:42] Parker: i’m curious why kennedy’s just echoing everyone else instead of offering her own suspect
[11:43:53] Parker: sam, you jumped on me first—why aren’t you questioning your own quick suspicion
[11:44:05] Sam: hold up—ray’s eagerness to pin this on parker feels too convenient
[11:44:05] Ray: parker, instead of deflecting explain why you’ve been so quiet
[11:44:08] Kennedy: i’m more suspicious of ray’s quick push to vote out parker than parker’s quietness
[11:44:13] Dakota: kennedy, if not parker who’s on your suspect list
[11:44:17] Sam: fair point—kennedy, do you see anything in parker’s silence that points to them being mafia
[11:44:22] Ray: fair enough—who do you think we should target, sam
[11:44:24] Dakota: ray, what about parker’s quietness screams mafia to you
