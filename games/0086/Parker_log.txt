The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. +

Maybe something like, "It’s a tough call; I\'m leaning towards Sam since they responded quickly." But that might just show eagerness. Ray has been quiet in the past, making it tricky to judge. The main choice is whether to send a message or wait. Since Parker prefers to be proactive, I\'m leaning towards sending it. So, I’ll go with: <send>.', type='summary_text')]

The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander.

[11:43:21] Kennedy: sam’s quick suspicion of parker feels like a convenient distraction
[11:43:21] Sam: parker, care to explain why you’ve been so quiet
Do you want to send a message to the group chat now, or do you prefer to wait for now and see what messages others will send? Remember to choose to send a message only if your contribution to the discussion in the current time will be meaningful enough. Make sure to say something every once in a while, and make yourself heard. Remember you like to be active in the game, so participate and be as talkative as other players! Reply only with `<send>` if you want to send a message now, or only with `<wait>` if you want to wait for now, based on your decision!

Add a very short message to the game's chat. Be specific and keep it relevant to the current situation, according to the last messages and the game's status. Your message should only be one short sentence! Don't add a message that you've already added (in the chat history)! It is very important that you don't repeat yourself! Match your style of message to the other player's message style, with more emphasis on more recent messages.
Don't add the time, the timestamp or the [timestamp] in your answer!

Add a very short message to the game's chat. Be specific and keep it relevant to the current situation, according to the last messages and the game's status. Your message should only be one short sentence! Don't add a message that you've already added (in the chat history)! It is very important that you don't repeat yourself! Match your style of message to the other player's message style, with more emphasis on more recent messages.
Don't add the time, the timestamp or the [timestamp] in your answer!

The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander.

The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.

## CONTENT: Your name is Parker.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [11:42:39].
The other players in the game are:
 Ray ( unknown ) 
 Sam ( unknown ) 
 Kennedy ( unknown ) 
 Dakota ( unknown ) 
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
Ray ( unknown ) 
Sam ( unknown ) 
Kennedy ( unknown ) 
Dakota ( unknown ) 
In your response to that is shown to the user (excluding your hidden scratchpad), you can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:
<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.

The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander.

The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander.

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[11:42:39] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[11:42:47] Sam: hey everyone, who’s first on your suspect list
[11:42:53] Ray: alright everyone, any initial suspicions on who we should vote out first
[11:42:56] Dakota: morning everyone—anyone looking suspicious already
[11:42:57] Kennedy: morning everyone—who’s your first suspect
[11:42:57] Parker: anyone have any initial suspicions before we cast votes
[11:43:03] Ray: i’m suspicious of parker since they’ve been super quiet
[11:43:03] Sam: anyone got a hunch who the mafia might be
[11:43:04] Dakota: parker’s awfully quiet—could be hiding something
[11:43:10] Parker: i’m a bit suspicious of sam’s quick question—anyone else pick up on that
[11:43:13] Kennedy: parker’s been awfully quiet—what’s your top suspect so far
[11:43:15] Dakota: ray makes a good point about parker—anyone else feel the same
[11:43:21] Kennedy: sam’s quick suspicion of parker feels like a convenient distraction
[11:43:21] Sam: parker, care to explain why you’ve been so quiet
[11:43:25] Parker: ray and dakota, what exactly did i say that’s more suspicious than anyone else
[11:43:33] Kennedy: parker, what about sam’s quick question makes you suspect them
[11:43:41] Ray: sam, why are you so quick to accuse parker
[11:43:42] Parker: i’m curious why kennedy’s just echoing everyone else instead of offering her own suspect
[11:43:53] Parker: sam, you jumped on me first—why aren’t you questioning your own quick suspicion
[11:44:05] Sam: hold up—ray’s eagerness to pin this on parker feels too convenient
[11:44:05] Ray: parker, instead of deflecting explain why you’ve been so quiet
[11:44:08] Kennedy: i’m more suspicious of ray’s quick push to vote out parker than parker’s quietness
[11:44:13] Dakota: kennedy, if not parker who’s on your suspect list
[11:44:17] Sam: fair point—kennedy, do you see anything in parker’s silence that points to them being mafia
[11:44:22] Ray: fair enough—who do you think we should target, sam
[11:44:24] Dakota: ray, what about parker’s quietness screams mafia to you
[11:44:32] Kennedy: sam’s rush to accuse parker feels off—they’re top of my suspect list now
[11:44:39] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[11:44:52] Game-Manager: Dakota voted for Parker
[11:45:03] Game-Manager: Sam voted for Ray
