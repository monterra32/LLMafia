## CONTENT: You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. + 
 + Do you understand the rules? +

The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [11:42:39].
The other players in the game are:
 Ray ( unknown )

In your response to that is shown to the user (excluding your hidden scratchpad), you can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:
<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.

Add a very short message to the game's chat. Be specific and keep it relevant to the current situation, according to the last messages and the game's status. Your message should only be one short sentence! Don't add a message that you've already added (in the chat history)! It is very important that you don't repeat yourself! Match your style of message to the other player's message style, with more emphasis on more recent messages.
Don't add the time, the timestamp or the [timestamp] in your answer!

## CONTENT: Your name is Sam.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [11:42:39].
The other players in the game are:
 Ray ( unknown ) 
 Parker ( unknown ) 
 Kennedy ( unknown ) 
 Dakota ( unknown ) 
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
Ray ( unknown ) 
Parker ( unknown ) 
Kennedy ( unknown ) 
Dakota ( unknown ) 
In your response to that is shown to the user (excluding your hidden scratchpad), you can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:
<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.

## CONTENT: [Summary(text='**Crafting a game response**\n\nThe user wants me to create a unique, short message for Sam in the game\'s chat, considering the current accusations amongst players. Sam should weigh in without repeating previous statements, so I\'ll say something like, "I think Ray\'s the one we should be looking at." This aligns well with the ongoing discussions while maintaining the flow of the chat. I\'ll ensure it reflects the players\' style and emphasis on recent messages.', type='summary_text'), Summary(text='**Formulating Sam\'s response**\n\nI need to create a message for Sam that fits within the current game conversation while avoiding repetition. Earlier, Sam noted Ray\'s eagerness to blame Parker, so rather than restating that, I could say something like, "Let\'s consider Kennedy—they\'re just echoing others and not bringing any new ideas." This keeps it fresh and matches the style of the ongoing discussion without rehashing previous points about Ray or Parker. It also introduces doubt about Kennedy in a clever way.', type='summary_text'), Summary(text='**Formulating Sam\'s Inquiry**\n\nI need to craft a short question for Sam to ask Dakota. The question should be concise and relevant to the ongoing conversation. I decided on: "Dakota, why so quick to back Ray’s take on Parker?" This keeps it straight to the point, maintaining a good flow while remaining under 15 words. It doesn’t repeat anything Sam has already said, and it subtly challenges Dakota’s stance. I think this works perfectly for the chat’s style!', type='summary_text')]

[11:42:57] Kennedy: morning everyone—who’s your first suspect
[11:42:57] Parker: anyone have any initial suspicions before we cast votes
[11:43:03] Ray: i’m suspicious of parker since they’ve been super quiet
[11:43:03] Sam: anyone got a hunch who the mafia might be
[11:43:04] Dakota: parker’s awfully quiet—could be hiding something
[11:43:10] Parker: i’m a bit suspicious of sam’s quick question—anyone else pick up on that
[11:43:13] Kennedy: parker’s been awfully quiet—what’s your top suspect so far
[11:43:15] Dakota: ray makes a good point about parker—anyone else feel the same
[11:43:21] Kennedy: sam’s quick suspicion of parker feels like a convenient distraction
[11:43:21] Sam: parker, care to explain why you’ve been so quiet
[11:43:25] Parker: ray and dakota, what exactly did i say that’s more suspicious than anyone else
[11:43:33] Kennedy: parker, what about sam’s quick question makes you suspect them
[11:43:41] Ray: sam, why are you so quick to accuse parker
[11:43:42] Parker: i’m curious why kennedy’s just echoing everyone else instead of offering her own suspect
[11:43:53] Parker: sam, you jumped on me first—why aren’t you questioning your own quick suspicion
[11:44:05] Sam: hold up—ray’s eagerness to pin this on parker feels too convenient
[11:44:05] Ray: parker, instead of deflecting explain why you’ve been so quiet
[11:44:08] Kennedy: i’m more suspicious of ray’s quick push to vote out parker than parker’s quietness

[11:44:17] Sam: fair point—kennedy, do you see anything in parker’s silence that points to them being mafia
[11:44:22] Ray: fair enough—who do you think we should target, sam
[11:44:24] Dakota: ray, what about parker’s quietness screams mafia to you
[11:44:32] Kennedy: sam’s rush to accuse parker feels off—they’re top of my suspect list now

## CONTENT: Your name is Sam.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [11:42:39].
