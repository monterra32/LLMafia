[17:26:11] Ray: hey everyone, ray here! excited to get started. since it’s day 1 and we’re all “clean” in our own minds, i’m curious—any gut feelings on who might be acting off? has anyone noticed someone being unusually quiet or maybe a bit too eager to point fingers? let’s hear your first impressions
[17:26:34] Ray: hey everyone! ray here—glad to be playing with you all. day 1 can be tricky since we haven’t seen much yet. i think it might help to throw out a trial vote just to see who jumps to defend. how about nominating sam as a placeholder—no hard feelings, sam, just curious how everyone reacts. thoughts
[17:26:55] Ray: nice point, kennedy—let’s put sam and parker in the hot seat. sam, parker, you’ve both been on listen-only mode so far: if you had to cast a vote right this second, who would it be and what’s your gut reasoning? let’s hear a quick reaction
[17:30:00] Ray: all right, sam and kennedy—day 2 begins and we’ve got to pick someone. i’m still hung up on sam’s lightning-fast pivot to parker at the end—that could be a bystander play, or classic misdirection. sam, what exactly were you reading when you flipped your vote? and kennedy, you caught that live—did anything about sam’s tone or reasoning strike you as off? let’s hash that out before we lock in our ballots
[17:30:37] Ray: wow, that was rough losing dakota—now it’s just the three of us. two back-to-back kills on folks who hung back (parker then dakota) makes me think the killer’s targeting quieter players. if that’s the pattern, i can’t imagine they’d come for someone who’s been pretty active in chat. 

sam, what’s your gut on that?  
kennedy, do you see the same pattern—or something else jumping out at you?  

let’s hear your reads before we lock in any votes
[17:31:08] Ray: vote: kennedy — her rapid timeline dissection seems too neat and rehearsed for genuine doubt, whereas sam’s reads have felt more organic. sam, you with me on this
