The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  +

## CONTENT: Your name is Ray.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  
You were assigned the following role: mafia. 
The game's chat room was open at [17:25:52].
The other players in the game are:
 Parker ( bystander ) 
 Sam ( bystander ) 
 Kennedy ( bystander ) 
 Dakota ( bystander ) 
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
Parker ( bystander ) 
Sam ( bystander ) 
Kennedy ( bystander ) 
Dakota ( bystander ) 
In your response to that is shown to the user (excluding your hidden scratchpad), you can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:
<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.

[17:26:16] Dakota: hi everyone, i’m dakota! just gearing up for day 1—i’m pretty new to mafia so i’ll likely hang back until i get a feel for everyone. early on i tend to watch for folks who suddenly dominate the convo or stay way too quiet. how about you? who’s played before, and what tells are you looking for today
[17:26:18] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! ready for day 1. with no prior rounds to go on, i’m going to watch who’s too quick to point fingers and who’s laying low. both can be red flags. so—ray, parker, sam, dakota—any gut instincts or odd vibes already? let’s get the ball rolling
[17:26:23] Sam: hey everyone, sam here. excited to kick off day 1—since nothing’s happened yet, i’m curious who you’re all eyeing. i haven’t spotted any big tells, but something about kennedy’s eagerness to dive in felt a bit off (could be nothing!). ray, parker, dakota—what stood out to you so far? let’s share before we lock in a vote
[17:26:24] Parker: hey everyone! now that day has started, how about quick first impressions? i’ve noticed ray’s been awfully quiet—could just be nerves, but it stood out to me. not saying he’s guilty, just something to flag. what are your gut feelings so far
[17:26:31] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! nice to meet you all. i’m with dakota on watching the quiet ones early on—sam and parker haven’t said a peep yet, which could just be nerves…or a deliberate low-profile tactic. on the flip side, ray, your eagerness to jump in is great for momentum but sometimes a little too “friendly host” energy can be a red flag. i’m leaning toward watching those silent corners first—maybe toss a question their way to see how they react. what do you all think? any quick ice-breaker questions we want to throw at sam or parker before we start casting votes
Do you want to send a message to the group chat now, or do you prefer to wait for now and see what messages others will send? Remember to choose to send a message only if your contribution to the discussion in the current time will be meaningful enough. Make sure to say something every once in a while, and make yourself heard. Remember you like to be active in the game, so participate and be as talkative as other players! Reply only with `<send>` if you want to send a message now, or only with `<wait>` if you want to wait for now, based on your decision!

## CONTENT: Your name is Ray.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  
You were assigned the following role: mafia. 
The game's chat room was open at [17:25:52].

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[17:25:52] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:26:11] Ray: hey everyone, ray here! excited to get started. since it’s day 1 and we’re all “clean” in our own minds, i’m curious—any gut feelings on who might be acting off? has anyone noticed someone being unusually quiet or maybe a bit too eager to point fingers? let’s hear your first impressions
[17:26:16] Dakota: hi everyone, i’m dakota! just gearing up for day 1—i’m pretty new to mafia so i’ll likely hang back until i get a feel for everyone. early on i tend to watch for folks who suddenly dominate the convo or stay way too quiet. how about you? who’s played before, and what tells are you looking for today
[17:26:18] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! ready for day 1. with no prior rounds to go on, i’m going to watch who’s too quick to point fingers and who’s laying low. both can be red flags. so—ray, parker, sam, dakota—any gut instincts or odd vibes already? let’s get the ball rolling
[17:26:23] Sam: hey everyone, sam here. excited to kick off day 1—since nothing’s happened yet, i’m curious who you’re all eyeing. i haven’t spotted any big tells, but something about kennedy’s eagerness to dive in felt a bit off (could be nothing!). ray, parker, dakota—what stood out to you so far? let’s share before we lock in a vote
[17:26:24] Parker: hey everyone! now that day has started, how about quick first impressions? i’ve noticed ray’s been awfully quiet—could just be nerves, but it stood out to me. not saying he’s guilty, just something to flag. what are your gut feelings so far
[17:26:31] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! nice to meet you all. i’m with dakota on watching the quiet ones early on—sam and parker haven’t said a peep yet, which could just be nerves…or a deliberate low-profile tactic. on the flip side, ray, your eagerness to jump in is great for momentum but sometimes a little too “friendly host” energy can be a red flag. i’m leaning toward watching those silent corners first—maybe toss a question their way to see how they react. what do you all think? any quick ice-breaker questions we want to throw at sam or parker before we start casting votes
[17:26:34] Ray: hey everyone! ray here—glad to be playing with you all. day 1 can be tricky since we haven’t seen much yet. i think it might help to throw out a trial vote just to see who jumps to defend. how about nominating sam as a placeholder—no hard feelings, sam, just curious how everyone reacts. thoughts
[17:26:35] Dakota: hey ray, excited to be here! personally, i haven’t seen any glaring red flags—everyone’s playing it pretty safe. i did notice parker took a little extra time before jumping in; could just be careful, but i’ll keep an eye on it. kennedy and sam have been quiet too—what are your thoughts? i’m planning to hang back this round and watch for reactions before casting any votes
[17:26:42] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! i’m also new to mafia, so my gut’s all over the place. i did notice kennedy jumping in fast to flag sam—could just be enthusiasm, but it felt a bit strategic. dakota’s hanging back, which might be a safe play. ray, you kicked us off energetically—nice move, but is that to keep us off your scent? i’m not locked on anyone yet. how about we each name one person we’re watching and why? might help us narrow things down
[17:26:51] Sam: hey everyone, sam here! i’m not seeing any glaring tells yet—no one’s been too pushy or totally mia… except parker’s radio silence. parker, what’s your read so far? ray, you mentioned watching for over-eager finger-pointing—did anything in dakota or kennedy’s intros strike you as odd? i’m still weighing options before we drift toward a lynch

[17:27:07] Dakota: sure—here’s mine:  
i’m watching parker, since your first real post came late and felt like you were sizing everyone up. i’m also eyeing ray, because you jumped to nominate sam right away—could be a test to see who defends.  
sam, you called out kennedy’s eagerness—what exactly struck you as off? and kennedy, what about sam’s vibe tipped you? let’s get those details before we lock in a vote
[17:27:08] Kennedy: great point, parker. i’ll kick us off: i’m watching ray—nominating sam right away struck me as a quick pressure test. ray, can you walk us through what tipped you off about sam rather than someone else? sam, what’s your take on being the first placeholder vote? dakota, parker, who are you keeping tabs on, and why
[17:27:08] Parker: i’m on board with a trial vote—let’s nominate sam as ray suggested. sam, no hard feelings, but how would you defend yourself if you ended up on the block? ray, what in particular made you zero in on sam? dakota, kennedy—anything you want to add before we cast
[17:27:19] Sam: sure, parker—i’ll go first. i’m watching kennedy, since they were super quick to spotlight me earlier and frame my friendliness as a red flag. could be genuine instinct, or a bit of misdirection. kennedy, can you expand on what specific tells made you zero in on me so fast
[17:27:22] Parker: i’m watching ray—your initial quiet intro, then the immediate sam nomination, feels like a pressure test to see who jumps to defend. i’m also keeping tabs on kennedy—your eagerness to steer questions at everyone so early could be genuine enthusiasm or a way to deflect attention. dakota’s hanging back is on my radar too, but for now i want to drill into these active plays. 

ray, what specifically about sam made you pick them as a placeholder?  
kennedy, why zero in on sam over someone else?  
sam and dakota, how are you reading these early moves?

[17:25:52] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:26:11] Ray: hey everyone, ray here! excited to get started. since it’s day 1 and we’re all “clean” in our own minds, i’m curious—any gut feelings on who might be acting off? has anyone noticed someone being unusually quiet or maybe a bit too eager to point fingers? let’s hear your first impressions
[17:26:16] Dakota: hi everyone, i’m dakota! just gearing up for day 1—i’m pretty new to mafia so i’ll likely hang back until i get a feel for everyone. early on i tend to watch for folks who suddenly dominate the convo or stay way too quiet. how about you? who’s played before, and what tells are you looking for today
[17:26:18] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! ready for day 1. with no prior rounds to go on, i’m going to watch who’s too quick to point fingers and who’s laying low. both can be red flags. so—ray, parker, sam, dakota—any gut instincts or odd vibes already? let’s get the ball rolling
[17:26:23] Sam: hey everyone, sam here. excited to kick off day 1—since nothing’s happened yet, i’m curious who you’re all eyeing. i haven’t spotted any big tells, but something about kennedy’s eagerness to dive in felt a bit off (could be nothing!). ray, parker, dakota—what stood out to you so far? let’s share before we lock in a vote
[17:26:24] Parker: hey everyone! now that day has started, how about quick first impressions? i’ve noticed ray’s been awfully quiet—could just be nerves, but it stood out to me. not saying he’s guilty, just something to flag. what are your gut feelings so far
[17:26:31] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! nice to meet you all. i’m with dakota on watching the quiet ones early on—sam and parker haven’t said a peep yet, which could just be nerves…or a deliberate low-profile tactic. on the flip side, ray, your eagerness to jump in is great for momentum but sometimes a little too “friendly host” energy can be a red flag. i’m leaning toward watching those silent corners first—maybe toss a question their way to see how they react. what do you all think? any quick ice-breaker questions we want to throw at sam or parker before we start casting votes
[17:26:34] Ray: hey everyone! ray here—glad to be playing with you all. day 1 can be tricky since we haven’t seen much yet. i think it might help to throw out a trial vote just to see who jumps to defend. how about nominating sam as a placeholder—no hard feelings, sam, just curious how everyone reacts. thoughts
[17:26:35] Dakota: hey ray, excited to be here! personally, i haven’t seen any glaring red flags—everyone’s playing it pretty safe. i did notice parker took a little extra time before jumping in; could just be careful, but i’ll keep an eye on it. kennedy and sam have been quiet too—what are your thoughts? i’m planning to hang back this round and watch for reactions before casting any votes
[17:26:42] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! i’m also new to mafia, so my gut’s all over the place. i did notice kennedy jumping in fast to flag sam—could just be enthusiasm, but it felt a bit strategic. dakota’s hanging back, which might be a safe play. ray, you kicked us off energetically—nice move, but is that to keep us off your scent? i’m not locked on anyone yet. how about we each name one person we’re watching and why? might help us narrow things down
[17:26:51] Sam: hey everyone, sam here! i’m not seeing any glaring tells yet—no one’s been too pushy or totally mia… except parker’s radio silence. parker, what’s your read so far? ray, you mentioned watching for over-eager finger-pointing—did anything in dakota or kennedy’s intros strike you as odd? i’m still weighing options before we drift toward a lynch
[17:26:55] Ray: nice point, kennedy—let’s put sam and parker in the hot seat. sam, parker, you’ve both been on listen-only mode so far: if you had to cast a vote right this second, who would it be and what’s your gut reasoning? let’s hear a quick reaction
[17:27:07] Dakota: sure—here’s mine:  
i’m watching parker, since your first real post came late and felt like you were sizing everyone up. i’m also eyeing ray, because you jumped to nominate sam right away—could be a test to see who defends.  
sam, you called out kennedy’s eagerness—what exactly struck you as off? and kennedy, what about sam’s vibe tipped you? let’s get those details before we lock in a vote
[17:27:08] Kennedy: great point, parker. i’ll kick us off: i’m watching ray—nominating sam right away struck me as a quick pressure test. ray, can you walk us through what tipped you off about sam rather than someone else? sam, what’s your take on being the first placeholder vote? dakota, parker, who are you keeping tabs on, and why
[17:27:08] Parker: i’m on board with a trial vote—let’s nominate sam as ray suggested. sam, no hard feelings, but how would you defend yourself if you ended up on the block? ray, what in particular made you zero in on sam? dakota, kennedy—anything you want to add before we cast
[17:27:19] Sam: sure, parker—i’ll go first. i’m watching kennedy, since they were super quick to spotlight me earlier and frame my friendliness as a red flag. could be genuine instinct, or a bit of misdirection. kennedy, can you expand on what specific tells made you zero in on me so fast
[17:27:22] Parker: i’m watching ray—your initial quiet intro, then the immediate sam nomination, feels like a pressure test to see who jumps to defend. i’m also keeping tabs on kennedy—your eagerness to steer questions at everyone so early could be genuine enthusiasm or a way to deflect attention. dakota’s hanging back is on my radar too, but for now i want to drill into these active plays. 

ray, what specifically about sam made you pick them as a placeholder?

## CONTENT: Your name is Ray.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  
You were assigned the following role: mafia. 
The game's chat room was open at [17:25:52].
The other players in the game are:
 Parker ( bystander ) 
 Sam ( bystander ) 
 Kennedy ( bystander ) 
 Dakota ( bystander ) 
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
Parker ( bystander ) 
Sam ( bystander ) 
Kennedy ( bystander ) 
Dakota ( bystander )

[17:27:31] Dakota: nice move, ray—forcing us to reveal early reactions can be really telling. sam, parker: if you had to lock in a vote right now, who would it be and why? i haven’t seen a strong tell yet, but if someone put a gun to my head i’d probably vote parker—her radio silence so far and that quick jab at kennedy felt a bit deflective. looking forward to hearing your picks before i make my decision
[17:27:42] Kennedy: good points, dakota. sam, you flagged my eagerness—could you share which part of my intro felt off? and i’ve noticed you’re quick to analyze but still haven’t dropped a vote, which reads more like deflection than simple hesitation. parker, since you’ve stayed quiet until now, if you had to nominate someone this second, who would it be and why? ray, is sam still your focus or are you ready to pivot? at the moment i’m eyeing parker’s stealth approach as worth questioning, but i’m open to shifting if someone brings a rock-solid read
[17:27:44] Sam: hey everyone—since i’m up for a placeholder vote, here’s my quick defense: i’ve chimed in four times already, asked pointed questions at kennedy and parker, and i’m actively tracking reactions, not laying low. ray, you said my eagerness felt off—what exactly in my first comment set off your spider senses over someone else’s? 

parker, your very first post came late and then you’ve been sizing everyone up—could be nerves, could be a low-profile tactic. i’m actually switching my provisional vote to you so we can see how you defend that timing under pressure. dakota, kennedy—anyone else want to move their vote to parker and see how this plays out?
[17:27:52] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[17:25:52] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:26:11] Ray: hey everyone, ray here! excited to get started. since it’s day 1 and we’re all “clean” in our own minds, i’m curious—any gut feelings on who might be acting off? has anyone noticed someone being unusually quiet or maybe a bit too eager to point fingers? let’s hear your first impressions
[17:26:16] Dakota: hi everyone, i’m dakota! just gearing up for day 1—i’m pretty new to mafia so i’ll likely hang back until i get a feel for everyone. early on i tend to watch for folks who suddenly dominate the convo or stay way too quiet. how about you? who’s played before, and what tells are you looking for today
[17:26:18] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! ready for day 1. with no prior rounds to go on, i’m going to watch who’s too quick to point fingers and who’s laying low. both can be red flags. so—ray, parker, sam, dakota—any gut instincts or odd vibes already? let’s get the ball rolling
[17:26:23] Sam: hey everyone, sam here. excited to kick off day 1—since nothing’s happened yet, i’m curious who you’re all eyeing. i haven’t spotted any big tells, but something about kennedy’s eagerness to dive in felt a bit off (could be nothing!). ray, parker, dakota—what stood out to you so far? let’s share before we lock in a vote
[17:26:24] Parker: hey everyone! now that day has started, how about quick first impressions? i’ve noticed ray’s been awfully quiet—could just be nerves, but it stood out to me. not saying he’s guilty, just something to flag. what are your gut feelings so far
[17:26:31] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! nice to meet you all. i’m with dakota on watching the quiet ones early on—sam and parker haven’t said a peep yet, which could just be nerves…or a deliberate low-profile tactic. on the flip side, ray, your eagerness to jump in is great for momentum but sometimes a little too “friendly host” energy can be a red flag. i’m leaning toward watching those silent corners first—maybe toss a question their way to see how they react. what do you all think? any quick ice-breaker questions we want to throw at sam or parker before we start casting votes
[17:26:34] Ray: hey everyone! ray here—glad to be playing with you all. day 1 can be tricky since we haven’t seen much yet. i think it might help to throw out a trial vote just to see who jumps to defend. how about nominating sam as a placeholder—no hard feelings, sam, just curious how everyone reacts. thoughts
[17:26:35] Dakota: hey ray, excited to be here! personally, i haven’t seen any glaring red flags—everyone’s playing it pretty safe. i did notice parker took a little extra time before jumping in; could just be careful, but i’ll keep an eye on it. kennedy and sam have been quiet too—what are your thoughts? i’m planning to hang back this round and watch for reactions before casting any votes
[17:26:42] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! i’m also new to mafia, so my gut’s all over the place. i did notice kennedy jumping in fast to flag sam—could just be enthusiasm, but it felt a bit strategic. dakota’s hanging back, which might be a safe play. ray, you kicked us off energetically—nice move, but is that to keep us off your scent? i’m not locked on anyone yet. how about we each name one person we’re watching and why? might help us narrow things down
[17:26:51] Sam: hey everyone, sam here! i’m not seeing any glaring tells yet—no one’s been too pushy or totally mia… except parker’s radio silence. parker, what’s your read so far? ray, you mentioned watching for over-eager finger-pointing—did anything in dakota or kennedy’s intros strike you as odd? i’m still weighing options before we drift toward a lynch
[17:26:55] Ray: nice point, kennedy—let’s put sam and parker in the hot seat. sam, parker, you’ve both been on listen-only mode so far: if you had to cast a vote right this second, who would it be and what’s your gut reasoning? let’s hear a quick reaction
[17:27:07] Dakota: sure—here’s mine:  
i’m watching parker, since your first real post came late and felt like you were sizing everyone up. i’m also eyeing ray, because you jumped to nominate sam right away—could be a test to see who defends.  
sam, you called out kennedy’s eagerness—what exactly struck you as off? and kennedy, what about sam’s vibe tipped you? let’s get those details before we lock in a vote
[17:27:08] Kennedy: great point, parker. i’ll kick us off: i’m watching ray—nominating sam right away struck me as a quick pressure test. ray, can you walk us through what tipped you off about sam rather than someone else? sam, what’s your take on being the first placeholder vote? dakota, parker, who are you keeping tabs on, and why
[17:27:08] Parker: i’m on board with a trial vote—let’s nominate sam as ray suggested. sam, no hard feelings, but how would you defend yourself if you ended up on the block? ray, what in particular made you zero in on sam? dakota, kennedy—anything you want to add before we cast
[17:27:19] Sam: sure, parker—i’ll go first. i’m watching kennedy, since they were super quick to spotlight me earlier and frame my friendliness as a red flag. could be genuine instinct, or a bit of misdirection. kennedy, can you expand on what specific tells made you zero in on me so fast
[17:27:22] Parker: i’m watching ray—your initial quiet intro, then the immediate sam nomination, feels like a pressure test to see who jumps to defend. i’m also keeping tabs on kennedy—your eagerness to steer questions at everyone so early could be genuine enthusiasm or a way to deflect attention. dakota’s hanging back is on my radar too, but for now i want to drill into these active plays. 

ray, what specifically about sam made you pick them as a placeholder?  
kennedy, why zero in on sam over someone else?  
sam and dakota, how are you reading these early moves?
[17:27:31] Dakota: nice move, ray—forcing us to reveal early reactions can be really telling. sam, parker: if you had to lock in a vote right now, who would it be and why? i haven’t seen a strong tell yet, but if someone put a gun to my head i’d probably vote parker—her radio silence so far and that quick jab at kennedy felt a bit deflective. looking forward to hearing your picks before i make my decision

[17:26:31] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! nice to meet you all. i’m with dakota on watching the quiet ones early on—sam and parker haven’t said a peep yet, which could just be nerves…or a deliberate low-profile tactic. on the flip side, ray, your eagerness to jump in is great for momentum but sometimes a little too “friendly host” energy can be a red flag. i’m leaning toward watching those silent corners first—maybe toss a question their way to see how they react. what do you all think? any quick ice-breaker questions we want to throw at sam or parker before we start casting votes
[17:26:34] Ray: hey everyone! ray here—glad to be playing with you all. day 1 can be tricky since we haven’t seen much yet. i think it might help to throw out a trial vote just to see who jumps to defend. how about nominating sam as a placeholder—no hard feelings, sam, just curious how everyone reacts. thoughts
[17:26:35] Dakota: hey ray, excited to be here! personally, i haven’t seen any glaring red flags—everyone’s playing it pretty safe. i did notice parker took a little extra time before jumping in; could just be careful, but i’ll keep an eye on it. kennedy and sam have been quiet too—what are your thoughts? i’m planning to hang back this round and watch for reactions before casting any votes
[17:26:42] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! i’m also new to mafia, so my gut’s all over the place. i did notice kennedy jumping in fast to flag sam—could just be enthusiasm, but it felt a bit strategic. dakota’s hanging back, which might be a safe play. ray, you kicked us off energetically—nice move, but is that to keep us off your scent? i’m not locked on anyone yet. how about we each name one person we’re watching and why? might help us narrow things down
[17:26:51] Sam: hey everyone, sam here! i’m not seeing any glaring tells yet—no one’s been too pushy or totally mia… except parker’s radio silence. parker, what’s your read so far? ray, you mentioned watching for over-eager finger-pointing—did anything in dakota or kennedy’s intros strike you as odd? i’m still weighing options before we drift toward a lynch
[17:26:55] Ray: nice point, kennedy—let’s put sam and parker in the hot seat. sam, parker, you’ve both been on listen-only mode so far: if you had to cast a vote right this second, who would it be and what’s your gut reasoning? let’s hear a quick reaction
[17:27:07] Dakota: sure—here’s mine:  
i’m watching parker, since your first real post came late and felt like you were sizing everyone up. i’m also eyeing ray, because you jumped to nominate sam right away—could be a test to see who defends.  
sam, you called out kennedy’s eagerness—what exactly struck you as off? and kennedy, what about sam’s vibe tipped you? let’s get those details before we lock in a vote
[17:27:08] Kennedy: great point, parker. i’ll kick us off: i’m watching ray—nominating sam right away struck me as a quick pressure test. ray, can you walk us through what tipped you off about sam rather than someone else? sam, what’s your take on being the first placeholder vote? dakota, parker, who are you keeping tabs on, and why
[17:27:08] Parker: i’m on board with a trial vote—let’s nominate sam as ray suggested. sam, no hard feelings, but how would you defend yourself if you ended up on the block? ray, what in particular made you zero in on sam? dakota, kennedy—anything you want to add before we cast
[17:27:19] Sam: sure, parker—i’ll go first. i’m watching kennedy, since they were super quick to spotlight me earlier and frame my friendliness as a red flag. could be genuine instinct, or a bit of misdirection. kennedy, can you expand on what specific tells made you zero in on me so fast
[17:27:22] Parker: i’m watching ray—your initial quiet intro, then the immediate sam nomination, feels like a pressure test to see who jumps to defend. i’m also keeping tabs on kennedy—your eagerness to steer questions at everyone so early could be genuine enthusiasm or a way to deflect attention. dakota’s hanging back is on my radar too, but for now i want to drill into these active plays. 

ray, what specifically about sam made you pick them as a placeholder?  
kennedy, why zero in on sam over someone else?  
sam and dakota, how are you reading these early moves?
[17:27:31] Dakota: nice move, ray—forcing us to reveal early reactions can be really telling. sam, parker: if you had to lock in a vote right now, who would it be and why? i haven’t seen a strong tell yet, but if someone put a gun to my head i’d probably vote parker—her radio silence so far and that quick jab at kennedy felt a bit deflective. looking forward to hearing your picks before i make my decision
[17:27:42] Kennedy: good points, dakota. sam, you flagged my eagerness—could you share which part of my intro felt off? and i’ve noticed you’re quick to analyze but still haven’t dropped a vote, which reads more like deflection than simple hesitation. parker, since you’ve stayed quiet until now, if you had to nominate someone this second, who would it be and why? ray, is sam still your focus or are you ready to pivot? at the moment i’m eyeing parker’s stealth approach as worth questioning, but i’m open to shifting if someone brings a rock-solid read
[17:27:44] Sam: hey everyone—since i’m up for a placeholder vote, here’s my quick defense: i’ve chimed in four times already, asked pointed questions at kennedy and parker, and i’m actively tracking reactions, not laying low. ray, you said my eagerness felt off—what exactly in my first comment set off your spider senses over someone else’s? 

parker, your very first post came late and then you’ve been sizing everyone up—could be nerves, could be a low-profile tactic. i’m actually switching my provisional vote to you so we can see how you defend that timing under pressure. dakota, kennedy—anyone else want to move their vote to parker and see how this plays out?
[17:27:52] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[17:28:13] Game-Manager: Dakota voted for Parker
[17:28:15] Game-Manager: Ray voted for Parker
[17:28:21] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Ray
[17:28:34] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Parker
[17:28:45] Game-Manager: Sam voted for Parker
[17:28:45] Game-Manager: Parker was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 1 mafia players left.
[17:28:45] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:28:45] Game-Manager: There is only one mafia member left, so no need for discussion - cutting straight to voting!
[17:28:45] Game-Manager: Nighttime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
Since you are a mafia, it is now time for you to determine who you want to kill. From the following remaining players, which player you want to kill? Base your answer on the conversation as seen in the message history, and especially on what you (Ray) said. Think through your choice carefully, as it will affect the game outcome. Reply with only one name from the list, and nothing but that name: Sam, Kennedy, Dakota

## CONTENT: Your name is Ray.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  
You were assigned the following role: mafia. 
The game's chat room was open at [17:25:52].
The other players in the game are:
 Parker ( bystander ) 
 Sam ( bystander ) 
 Kennedy ( bystander ) 
 Dakota ( bystander ) 
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
Sam ( bystander ) 
Kennedy ( bystander ) 
In your response to that is shown to the user (excluding your hidden scratchpad), you can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:
<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.

[17:25:52] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:26:11] Ray: hey everyone, ray here! excited to get started. since it’s day 1 and we’re all “clean” in our own minds, i’m curious—any gut feelings on who might be acting off? has anyone noticed someone being unusually quiet or maybe a bit too eager to point fingers? let’s hear your first impressions
[17:26:16] Dakota: hi everyone, i’m dakota! just gearing up for day 1—i’m pretty new to mafia so i’ll likely hang back until i get a feel for everyone. early on i tend to watch for folks who suddenly dominate the convo or stay way too quiet. how about you? who’s played before, and what tells are you looking for today
[17:26:18] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! ready for day 1. with no prior rounds to go on, i’m going to watch who’s too quick to point fingers and who’s laying low. both can be red flags. so—ray, parker, sam, dakota—any gut instincts or odd vibes already? let’s get the ball rolling
[17:26:23] Sam: hey everyone, sam here. excited to kick off day 1—since nothing’s happened yet, i’m curious who you’re all eyeing. i haven’t spotted any big tells, but something about kennedy’s eagerness to dive in felt a bit off (could be nothing!). ray, parker, dakota—what stood out to you so far? let’s share before we lock in a vote

[17:25:52] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:26:11] Ray: hey everyone, ray here! excited to get started. since it’s day 1 and we’re all “clean” in our own minds, i’m curious—any gut feelings on who might be acting off? has anyone noticed someone being unusually quiet or maybe a bit too eager to point fingers? let’s hear your first impressions
[17:26:16] Dakota: hi everyone, i’m dakota! just gearing up for day 1—i’m pretty new to mafia so i’ll likely hang back until i get a feel for everyone. early on i tend to watch for folks who suddenly dominate the convo or stay way too quiet. how about you? who’s played before, and what tells are you looking for today
[17:26:18] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! ready for day 1. with no prior rounds to go on, i’m going to watch who’s too quick to point fingers and who’s laying low. both can be red flags. so—ray, parker, sam, dakota—any gut instincts or odd vibes already? let’s get the ball rolling
[17:26:23] Sam: hey everyone, sam here. excited to kick off day 1—since nothing’s happened yet, i’m curious who you’re all eyeing. i haven’t spotted any big tells, but something about kennedy’s eagerness to dive in felt a bit off (could be nothing!). ray, parker, dakota—what stood out to you so far? let’s share before we lock in a vote
[17:26:24] Parker: hey everyone! now that day has started, how about quick first impressions? i’ve noticed ray’s been awfully quiet—could just be nerves, but it stood out to me. not saying he’s guilty, just something to flag. what are your gut feelings so far
[17:26:31] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! nice to meet you all. i’m with dakota on watching the quiet ones early on—sam and parker haven’t said a peep yet, which could just be nerves…or a deliberate low-profile tactic. on the flip side, ray, your eagerness to jump in is great for momentum but sometimes a little too “friendly host” energy can be a red flag. i’m leaning toward watching those silent corners first—maybe toss a question their way to see how they react. what do you all think? any quick ice-breaker questions we want to throw at sam or parker before we start casting votes
[17:26:34] Ray: hey everyone! ray here—glad to be playing with you all. day 1 can be tricky since we haven’t seen much yet. i think it might help to throw out a trial vote just to see who jumps to defend. how about nominating sam as a placeholder—no hard feelings, sam, just curious how everyone reacts. thoughts
[17:26:35] Dakota: hey ray, excited to be here! personally, i haven’t seen any glaring red flags—everyone’s playing it pretty safe. i did notice parker took a little extra time before jumping in; could just be careful, but i’ll keep an eye on it. kennedy and sam have been quiet too—what are your thoughts? i’m planning to hang back this round and watch for reactions before casting any votes
[17:26:42] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! i’m also new to mafia, so my gut’s all over the place. i did notice kennedy jumping in fast to flag sam—could just be enthusiasm, but it felt a bit strategic. dakota’s hanging back, which might be a safe play. ray, you kicked us off energetically—nice move, but is that to keep us off your scent? i’m not locked on anyone yet. how about we each name one person we’re watching and why? might help us narrow things down
[17:26:51] Sam: hey everyone, sam here! i’m not seeing any glaring tells yet—no one’s been too pushy or totally mia… except parker’s radio silence. parker, what’s your read so far? ray, you mentioned watching for over-eager finger-pointing—did anything in dakota or kennedy’s intros strike you as odd? i’m still weighing options before we drift toward a lynch
[17:26:55] Ray: nice point, kennedy—let’s put sam and parker in the hot seat. sam, parker, you’ve both been on listen-only mode so far: if you had to cast a vote right this second, who would it be and what’s your gut reasoning? let’s hear a quick reaction
[17:27:07] Dakota: sure—here’s mine:  
i’m watching parker, since your first real post came late and felt like you were sizing everyone up. i’m also eyeing ray, because you jumped to nominate sam right away—could be a test to see who defends.  
sam, you called out kennedy’s eagerness—what exactly struck you as off? and kennedy, what about sam’s vibe tipped you? let’s get those details before we lock in a vote
[17:27:08] Kennedy: great point, parker. i’ll kick us off: i’m watching ray—nominating sam right away struck me as a quick pressure test. ray, can you walk us through what tipped you off about sam rather than someone else? sam, what’s your take on being the first placeholder vote? dakota, parker, who are you keeping tabs on, and why
[17:27:08] Parker: i’m on board with a trial vote—let’s nominate sam as ray suggested. sam, no hard feelings, but how would you defend yourself if you ended up on the block? ray, what in particular made you zero in on sam? dakota, kennedy—anything you want to add before we cast
[17:27:19] Sam: sure, parker—i’ll go first. i’m watching kennedy, since they were super quick to spotlight me earlier and frame my friendliness as a red flag. could be genuine instinct, or a bit of misdirection. kennedy, can you expand on what specific tells made you zero in on me so fast
[17:27:22] Parker: i’m watching ray—your initial quiet intro, then the immediate sam nomination, feels like a pressure test to see who jumps to defend. i’m also keeping tabs on kennedy—your eagerness to steer questions at everyone so early could be genuine enthusiasm or a way to deflect attention. dakota’s hanging back is on my radar too, but for now i want to drill into these active plays. 

ray, what specifically about sam made you pick them as a placeholder?  
kennedy, why zero in on sam over someone else?  
sam and dakota, how are you reading these early moves?
[17:27:31] Dakota: nice move, ray—forcing us to reveal early reactions can be really telling. sam, parker: if you had to lock in a vote right now, who would it be and why? i haven’t seen a strong tell yet, but if someone put a gun to my head i’d probably vote parker—her radio silence so far and that quick jab at kennedy felt a bit deflective. looking forward to hearing your picks before i make my decision
[17:27:42] Kennedy: good points, dakota. sam, you flagged my eagerness—could you share which part of my intro felt off? and i’ve noticed you’re quick to analyze but still haven’t dropped a vote, which reads more like deflection than simple hesitation. parker, since you’ve stayed quiet until now, if you had to nominate someone this second, who would it be and why? ray, is sam still your focus or are you ready to pivot? at the moment i’m eyeing parker’s stealth approach as worth questioning, but i’m open to shifting if someone brings a rock-solid read
[17:27:44] Sam: hey everyone—since i’m up for a placeholder vote, here’s my quick defense: i’ve chimed in four times already, asked pointed questions at kennedy and parker, and i’m actively tracking reactions, not laying low. ray, you said my eagerness felt off—what exactly in my first comment set off your spider senses over someone else’s? 

parker, your very first post came late and then you’ve been sizing everyone up—could be nerves, could be a low-profile tactic. i’m actually switching my provisional vote to you so we can see how you defend that timing under pressure. dakota, kennedy—anyone else want to move their vote to parker and see how this plays out?

The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  
You were assigned the following role: mafia.

Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  
You were assigned the following role: mafia. 
The game's chat room was open at [17:25:52].
The other players in the game are:

[17:26:18] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! ready for day 1. with no prior rounds to go on, i’m going to watch who’s too quick to point fingers and who’s laying low. both can be red flags. so—ray, parker, sam, dakota—any gut instincts or odd vibes already? let’s get the ball rolling
[17:26:23] Sam: hey everyone, sam here. excited to kick off day 1—since nothing’s happened yet, i’m curious who you’re all eyeing. i haven’t spotted any big tells, but something about kennedy’s eagerness to dive in felt a bit off (could be nothing!). ray, parker, dakota—what stood out to you so far? let’s share before we lock in a vote
[17:26:24] Parker: hey everyone! now that day has started, how about quick first impressions? i’ve noticed ray’s been awfully quiet—could just be nerves, but it stood out to me. not saying he’s guilty, just something to flag. what are your gut feelings so far
[17:26:31] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! nice to meet you all. i’m with dakota on watching the quiet ones early on—sam and parker haven’t said a peep yet, which could just be nerves…or a deliberate low-profile tactic. on the flip side, ray, your eagerness to jump in is great for momentum but sometimes a little too “friendly host” energy can be a red flag. i’m leaning toward watching those silent corners first—maybe toss a question their way to see how they react. what do you all think? any quick ice-breaker questions we want to throw at sam or parker before we start casting votes
[17:26:34] Ray: hey everyone! ray here—glad to be playing with you all. day 1 can be tricky since we haven’t seen much yet. i think it might help to throw out a trial vote just to see who jumps to defend. how about nominating sam as a placeholder—no hard feelings, sam, just curious how everyone reacts. thoughts
[17:26:35] Dakota: hey ray, excited to be here! personally, i haven’t seen any glaring red flags—everyone’s playing it pretty safe. i did notice parker took a little extra time before jumping in; could just be careful, but i’ll keep an eye on it. kennedy and sam have been quiet too—what are your thoughts? i’m planning to hang back this round and watch for reactions before casting any votes
[17:26:42] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! i’m also new to mafia, so my gut’s all over the place. i did notice kennedy jumping in fast to flag sam—could just be enthusiasm, but it felt a bit strategic. dakota’s hanging back, which might be a safe play. ray, you kicked us off energetically—nice move, but is that to keep us off your scent? i’m not locked on anyone yet. how about we each name one person we’re watching and why? might help us narrow things down
[17:26:51] Sam: hey everyone, sam here! i’m not seeing any glaring tells yet—no one’s been too pushy or totally mia… except parker’s radio silence. parker, what’s your read so far? ray, you mentioned watching for over-eager finger-pointing—did anything in dakota or kennedy’s intros strike you as odd? i’m still weighing options before we drift toward a lynch
[17:26:55] Ray: nice point, kennedy—let’s put sam and parker in the hot seat. sam, parker, you’ve both been on listen-only mode so far: if you had to cast a vote right this second, who would it be and what’s your gut reasoning? let’s hear a quick reaction
[17:27:07] Dakota: sure—here’s mine:  
i’m watching parker, since your first real post came late and felt like you were sizing everyone up. i’m also eyeing ray, because you jumped to nominate sam right away—could be a test to see who defends.  
sam, you called out kennedy’s eagerness—what exactly struck you as off? and kennedy, what about sam’s vibe tipped you? let’s get those details before we lock in a vote
[17:27:08] Kennedy: great point, parker. i’ll kick us off: i’m watching ray—nominating sam right away struck me as a quick pressure test. ray, can you walk us through what tipped you off about sam rather than someone else? sam, what’s your take on being the first placeholder vote? dakota, parker, who are you keeping tabs on, and why
[17:27:08] Parker: i’m on board with a trial vote—let’s nominate sam as ray suggested. sam, no hard feelings, but how would you defend yourself if you ended up on the block? ray, what in particular made you zero in on sam? dakota, kennedy—anything you want to add before we cast
[17:27:19] Sam: sure, parker—i’ll go first. i’m watching kennedy, since they were super quick to spotlight me earlier and frame my friendliness as a red flag. could be genuine instinct, or a bit of misdirection. kennedy, can you expand on what specific tells made you zero in on me so fast
[17:27:22] Parker: i’m watching ray—your initial quiet intro, then the immediate sam nomination, feels like a pressure test to see who jumps to defend. i’m also keeping tabs on kennedy—your eagerness to steer questions at everyone so early could be genuine enthusiasm or a way to deflect attention. dakota’s hanging back is on my radar too, but for now i want to drill into these active plays. 

ray, what specifically about sam made you pick them as a placeholder?  
kennedy, why zero in on sam over someone else?  
sam and dakota, how are you reading these early moves?
[17:27:31] Dakota: nice move, ray—forcing us to reveal early reactions can be really telling. sam, parker: if you had to lock in a vote right now, who would it be and why? i haven’t seen a strong tell yet, but if someone put a gun to my head i’d probably vote parker—her radio silence so far and that quick jab at kennedy felt a bit deflective. looking forward to hearing your picks before i make my decision
[17:27:42] Kennedy: good points, dakota. sam, you flagged my eagerness—could you share which part of my intro felt off? and i’ve noticed you’re quick to analyze but still haven’t dropped a vote, which reads more like deflection than simple hesitation. parker, since you’ve stayed quiet until now, if you had to nominate someone this second, who would it be and why? ray, is sam still your focus or are you ready to pivot? at the moment i’m eyeing parker’s stealth approach as worth questioning, but i’m open to shifting if someone brings a rock-solid read
[17:27:44] Sam: hey everyone—since i’m up for a placeholder vote, here’s my quick defense: i’ve chimed in four times already, asked pointed questions at kennedy and parker, and i’m actively tracking reactions, not laying low. ray, you said my eagerness felt off—what exactly in my first comment set off your spider senses over someone else’s? 

parker, your very first post came late and then you’ve been sizing everyone up—could be nerves, could be a low-profile tactic. i’m actually switching my provisional vote to you so we can see how you defend that timing under pressure. dakota, kennedy—anyone else want to move their vote to parker and see how this plays out?

## CONTENT: Your name is Ray.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  
You were assigned the following role: mafia. 
The game's chat room was open at [17:25:52].
The other players in the game are:
 Parker ( bystander ) 
 Sam ( bystander ) 
 Kennedy ( bystander ) 
 Dakota ( bystander ) 
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
Sam ( bystander ) 
Kennedy ( bystander )

[17:26:55] Ray: nice point, kennedy—let’s put sam and parker in the hot seat. sam, parker, you’ve both been on listen-only mode so far: if you had to cast a vote right this second, who would it be and what’s your gut reasoning? let’s hear a quick reaction
[17:27:07] Dakota: sure—here’s mine:  
i’m watching parker, since your first real post came late and felt like you were sizing everyone up. i’m also eyeing ray, because you jumped to nominate sam right away—could be a test to see who defends.  
sam, you called out kennedy’s eagerness—what exactly struck you as off? and kennedy, what about sam’s vibe tipped you? let’s get those details before we lock in a vote
[17:27:08] Kennedy: great point, parker. i’ll kick us off: i’m watching ray—nominating sam right away struck me as a quick pressure test. ray, can you walk us through what tipped you off about sam rather than someone else? sam, what’s your take on being the first placeholder vote? dakota, parker, who are you keeping tabs on, and why
[17:27:08] Parker: i’m on board with a trial vote—let’s nominate sam as ray suggested. sam, no hard feelings, but how would you defend yourself if you ended up on the block? ray, what in particular made you zero in on sam? dakota, kennedy—anything you want to add before we cast
[17:27:19] Sam: sure, parker—i’ll go first. i’m watching kennedy, since they were super quick to spotlight me earlier and frame my friendliness as a red flag. could be genuine instinct, or a bit of misdirection. kennedy, can you expand on what specific tells made you zero in on me so fast
[17:27:22] Parker: i’m watching ray—your initial quiet intro, then the immediate sam nomination, feels like a pressure test to see who jumps to defend. i’m also keeping tabs on kennedy—your eagerness to steer questions at everyone so early could be genuine enthusiasm or a way to deflect attention. dakota’s hanging back is on my radar too, but for now i want to drill into these active plays. 

ray, what specifically about sam made you pick them as a placeholder?  
kennedy, why zero in on sam over someone else?  
sam and dakota, how are you reading these early moves?
[17:27:31] Dakota: nice move, ray—forcing us to reveal early reactions can be really telling. sam, parker: if you had to lock in a vote right now, who would it be and why? i haven’t seen a strong tell yet, but if someone put a gun to my head i’d probably vote parker—her radio silence so far and that quick jab at kennedy felt a bit deflective. looking forward to hearing your picks before i make my decision
[17:27:42] Kennedy: good points, dakota. sam, you flagged my eagerness—could you share which part of my intro felt off? and i’ve noticed you’re quick to analyze but still haven’t dropped a vote, which reads more like deflection than simple hesitation. parker, since you’ve stayed quiet until now, if you had to nominate someone this second, who would it be and why? ray, is sam still your focus or are you ready to pivot? at the moment i’m eyeing parker’s stealth approach as worth questioning, but i’m open to shifting if someone brings a rock-solid read
[17:27:44] Sam: hey everyone—since i’m up for a placeholder vote, here’s my quick defense: i’ve chimed in four times already, asked pointed questions at kennedy and parker, and i’m actively tracking reactions, not laying low. ray, you said my eagerness felt off—what exactly in my first comment set off your spider senses over someone else’s? 

parker, your very first post came late and then you’ve been sizing everyone up—could be nerves, could be a low-profile tactic. i’m actually switching my provisional vote to you so we can see how you defend that timing under pressure. dakota, kennedy—anyone else want to move their vote to parker and see how this plays out?

## CONTENT: Your name is Ray.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  
You were assigned the following role: mafia. 
The game's chat room was open at [17:25:52].
The other players in the game are:
 Parker ( bystander ) 
 Sam ( bystander ) 
 Kennedy ( bystander ) 
 Dakota ( bystander ) 
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
Sam ( bystander ) 
Kennedy ( bystander ) 
In your response to that is shown to the user (excluding your hidden scratchpad), you can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[17:25:52] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:26:11] Ray: hey everyone, ray here! excited to get started. since it’s day 1 and we’re all “clean” in our own minds, i’m curious—any gut feelings on who might be acting off? has anyone noticed someone being unusually quiet or maybe a bit too eager to point fingers? let’s hear your first impressions
[17:26:16] Dakota: hi everyone, i’m dakota! just gearing up for day 1—i’m pretty new to mafia so i’ll likely hang back until i get a feel for everyone. early on i tend to watch for folks who suddenly dominate the convo or stay way too quiet. how about you? who’s played before, and what tells are you looking for today
[17:26:18] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! ready for day 1. with no prior rounds to go on, i’m going to watch who’s too quick to point fingers and who’s laying low. both can be red flags. so—ray, parker, sam, dakota—any gut instincts or odd vibes already? let’s get the ball rolling
[17:26:23] Sam: hey everyone, sam here. excited to kick off day 1—since nothing’s happened yet, i’m curious who you’re all eyeing. i haven’t spotted any big tells, but something about kennedy’s eagerness to dive in felt a bit off (could be nothing!). ray, parker, dakota—what stood out to you so far? let’s share before we lock in a vote
[17:26:24] Parker: hey everyone! now that day has started, how about quick first impressions? i’ve noticed ray’s been awfully quiet—could just be nerves, but it stood out to me. not saying he’s guilty, just something to flag. what are your gut feelings so far
[17:26:31] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! nice to meet you all. i’m with dakota on watching the quiet ones early on—sam and parker haven’t said a peep yet, which could just be nerves…or a deliberate low-profile tactic. on the flip side, ray, your eagerness to jump in is great for momentum but sometimes a little too “friendly host” energy can be a red flag. i’m leaning toward watching those silent corners first—maybe toss a question their way to see how they react. what do you all think? any quick ice-breaker questions we want to throw at sam or parker before we start casting votes
[17:26:34] Ray: hey everyone! ray here—glad to be playing with you all. day 1 can be tricky since we haven’t seen much yet. i think it might help to throw out a trial vote just to see who jumps to defend. how about nominating sam as a placeholder—no hard feelings, sam, just curious how everyone reacts. thoughts
[17:26:35] Dakota: hey ray, excited to be here! personally, i haven’t seen any glaring red flags—everyone’s playing it pretty safe. i did notice parker took a little extra time before jumping in; could just be careful, but i’ll keep an eye on it. kennedy and sam have been quiet too—what are your thoughts? i’m planning to hang back this round and watch for reactions before casting any votes
[17:26:42] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! i’m also new to mafia, so my gut’s all over the place. i did notice kennedy jumping in fast to flag sam—could just be enthusiasm, but it felt a bit strategic. dakota’s hanging back, which might be a safe play. ray, you kicked us off energetically—nice move, but is that to keep us off your scent? i’m not locked on anyone yet. how about we each name one person we’re watching and why? might help us narrow things down
[17:26:51] Sam: hey everyone, sam here! i’m not seeing any glaring tells yet—no one’s been too pushy or totally mia… except parker’s radio silence. parker, what’s your read so far? ray, you mentioned watching for over-eager finger-pointing—did anything in dakota or kennedy’s intros strike you as odd? i’m still weighing options before we drift toward a lynch
[17:26:55] Ray: nice point, kennedy—let’s put sam and parker in the hot seat. sam, parker, you’ve both been on listen-only mode so far: if you had to cast a vote right this second, who would it be and what’s your gut reasoning? let’s hear a quick reaction
[17:27:07] Dakota: sure—here’s mine:  
i’m watching parker, since your first real post came late and felt like you were sizing everyone up. i’m also eyeing ray, because you jumped to nominate sam right away—could be a test to see who defends.  
sam, you called out kennedy’s eagerness—what exactly struck you as off? and kennedy, what about sam’s vibe tipped you? let’s get those details before we lock in a vote
[17:27:08] Kennedy: great point, parker. i’ll kick us off: i’m watching ray—nominating sam right away struck me as a quick pressure test. ray, can you walk us through what tipped you off about sam rather than someone else? sam, what’s your take on being the first placeholder vote? dakota, parker, who are you keeping tabs on, and why
[17:27:08] Parker: i’m on board with a trial vote—let’s nominate sam as ray suggested. sam, no hard feelings, but how would you defend yourself if you ended up on the block? ray, what in particular made you zero in on sam? dakota, kennedy—anything you want to add before we cast
[17:27:19] Sam: sure, parker—i’ll go first. i’m watching kennedy, since they were super quick to spotlight me earlier and frame my friendliness as a red flag. could be genuine instinct, or a bit of misdirection. kennedy, can you expand on what specific tells made you zero in on me so fast

[17:27:42] Kennedy: good points, dakota. sam, you flagged my eagerness—could you share which part of my intro felt off? and i’ve noticed you’re quick to analyze but still haven’t dropped a vote, which reads more like deflection than simple hesitation. parker, since you’ve stayed quiet until now, if you had to nominate someone this second, who would it be and why? ray, is sam still your focus or are you ready to pivot? at the moment i’m eyeing parker’s stealth approach as worth questioning, but i’m open to shifting if someone brings a rock-solid read
[17:27:44] Sam: hey everyone—since i’m up for a placeholder vote, here’s my quick defense: i’ve chimed in four times already, asked pointed questions at kennedy and parker, and i’m actively tracking reactions, not laying low. ray, you said my eagerness felt off—what exactly in my first comment set off your spider senses over someone else’s?

[17:29:23] Game-Manager: Ray voted for Dakota
[17:30:00] Ray: all right, sam and kennedy—day 2 begins and we’ve got to pick someone. i’m still hung up on sam’s lightning-fast pivot to parker at the end—that could be a bystander play, or classic misdirection. sam, what exactly were you reading when you flipped your vote? and kennedy, you caught that live—did anything about sam’s tone or reasoning strike you as off? let’s hash that out before we lock in our ballots
[17:30:12] Sam: woah, final three already! one of you is the mafia, so let’s see where everyone stands. please post:

vote: [ray or kennedy] — [one-sentence reason]

i’ll kick us off:

vote: ray — you led that day 1 probe on me as a “placeholder” and never really defended it once things shifted to parker.

ray, kennedy: over to you!
[17:30:15] Kennedy: alright ray and sam—two bystanders gone, so one of you is definitely the mafia. i’m tentatively leaning toward sam—your swift defense and vote flip yesterday felt almost too neat. ray, your rapid pivot from testing sam to parker struck me as more of a test on me than on true threats. i’m not locked in yet though. if you each had to cast your lynch right now, who would you pick and why? let’s hear quick answers before we vote
Do you want to send a message to the group chat now, or do you prefer to wait for now and see what messages others will send? Remember to choose to send a message only if your contribution to the discussion in the current time will be meaningful enough. Don't overflow the discussion with your messages! Pay attention to the amount of messages with your name compared to the amount of messages with names of other players and let them have their turn too! Check the speaker name in the last few messages, and decide accordingly based on whether you talked too much. Reply only with `<send>` if you want to send a message now, or only with `<wait>` if you want to wait for now, based on your decision!

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[17:25:52] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:26:11] Ray: hey everyone, ray here! excited to get started. since it’s day 1 and we’re all “clean” in our own minds, i’m curious—any gut feelings on who might be acting off? has anyone noticed someone being unusually quiet or maybe a bit too eager to point fingers? let’s hear your first impressions
[17:26:16] Dakota: hi everyone, i’m dakota! just gearing up for day 1—i’m pretty new to mafia so i’ll likely hang back until i get a feel for everyone. early on i tend to watch for folks who suddenly dominate the convo or stay way too quiet. how about you? who’s played before, and what tells are you looking for today
[17:26:18] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! ready for day 1. with no prior rounds to go on, i’m going to watch who’s too quick to point fingers and who’s laying low. both can be red flags. so—ray, parker, sam, dakota—any gut instincts or odd vibes already? let’s get the ball rolling
[17:26:23] Sam: hey everyone, sam here. excited to kick off day 1—since nothing’s happened yet, i’m curious who you’re all eyeing. i haven’t spotted any big tells, but something about kennedy’s eagerness to dive in felt a bit off (could be nothing!). ray, parker, dakota—what stood out to you so far? let’s share before we lock in a vote
[17:26:24] Parker: hey everyone! now that day has started, how about quick first impressions? i’ve noticed ray’s been awfully quiet—could just be nerves, but it stood out to me. not saying he’s guilty, just something to flag. what are your gut feelings so far
[17:26:31] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! nice to meet you all. i’m with dakota on watching the quiet ones early on—sam and parker haven’t said a peep yet, which could just be nerves…or a deliberate low-profile tactic. on the flip side, ray, your eagerness to jump in is great for momentum but sometimes a little too “friendly host” energy can be a red flag. i’m leaning toward watching those silent corners first—maybe toss a question their way to see how they react. what do you all think? any quick ice-breaker questions we want to throw at sam or parker before we start casting votes
[17:26:34] Ray: hey everyone! ray here—glad to be playing with you all. day 1 can be tricky since we haven’t seen much yet. i think it might help to throw out a trial vote just to see who jumps to defend. how about nominating sam as a placeholder—no hard feelings, sam, just curious how everyone reacts. thoughts
[17:26:35] Dakota: hey ray, excited to be here! personally, i haven’t seen any glaring red flags—everyone’s playing it pretty safe. i did notice parker took a little extra time before jumping in; could just be careful, but i’ll keep an eye on it. kennedy and sam have been quiet too—what are your thoughts? i’m planning to hang back this round and watch for reactions before casting any votes
[17:26:42] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! i’m also new to mafia, so my gut’s all over the place. i did notice kennedy jumping in fast to flag sam—could just be enthusiasm, but it felt a bit strategic. dakota’s hanging back, which might be a safe play. ray, you kicked us off energetically—nice move, but is that to keep us off your scent? i’m not locked on anyone yet. how about we each name one person we’re watching and why? might help us narrow things down
[17:26:51] Sam: hey everyone, sam here! i’m not seeing any glaring tells yet—no one’s been too pushy or totally mia… except parker’s radio silence. parker, what’s your read so far? ray, you mentioned watching for over-eager finger-pointing—did anything in dakota or kennedy’s intros strike you as odd? i’m still weighing options before we drift toward a lynch
[17:26:55] Ray: nice point, kennedy—let’s put sam and parker in the hot seat. sam, parker, you’ve both been on listen-only mode so far: if you had to cast a vote right this second, who would it be and what’s your gut reasoning? let’s hear a quick reaction
[17:27:07] Dakota: sure—here’s mine:  
i’m watching parker, since your first real post came late and felt like you were sizing everyone up. i’m also eyeing ray, because you jumped to nominate sam right away—could be a test to see who defends.  
sam, you called out kennedy’s eagerness—what exactly struck you as off? and kennedy, what about sam’s vibe tipped you? let’s get those details before we lock in a vote
[17:27:08] Kennedy: great point, parker. i’ll kick us off: i’m watching ray—nominating sam right away struck me as a quick pressure test. ray, can you walk us through what tipped you off about sam rather than someone else? sam, what’s your take on being the first placeholder vote? dakota, parker, who are you keeping tabs on, and why
[17:27:08] Parker: i’m on board with a trial vote—let’s nominate sam as ray suggested. sam, no hard feelings, but how would you defend yourself if you ended up on the block? ray, what in particular made you zero in on sam? dakota, kennedy—anything you want to add before we cast
[17:27:19] Sam: sure, parker—i’ll go first. i’m watching kennedy, since they were super quick to spotlight me earlier and frame my friendliness as a red flag. could be genuine instinct, or a bit of misdirection. kennedy, can you expand on what specific tells made you zero in on me so fast
[17:27:22] Parker: i’m watching ray—your initial quiet intro, then the immediate sam nomination, feels like a pressure test to see who jumps to defend. i’m also keeping tabs on kennedy—your eagerness to steer questions at everyone so early could be genuine enthusiasm or a way to deflect attention. dakota’s hanging back is on my radar too, but for now i want to drill into these active plays. 

ray, what specifically about sam made you pick them as a placeholder?  
kennedy, why zero in on sam over someone else?  
sam and dakota, how are you reading these early moves?
[17:27:31] Dakota: nice move, ray—forcing us to reveal early reactions can be really telling. sam, parker: if you had to lock in a vote right now, who would it be and why? i haven’t seen a strong tell yet, but if someone put a gun to my head i’d probably vote parker—her radio silence so far and that quick jab at kennedy felt a bit deflective. looking forward to hearing your picks before i make my decision
[17:27:42] Kennedy: good points, dakota. sam, you flagged my eagerness—could you share which part of my intro felt off? and i’ve noticed you’re quick to analyze but still haven’t dropped a vote, which reads more like deflection than simple hesitation. parker, since you’ve stayed quiet until now, if you had to nominate someone this second, who would it be and why? ray, is sam still your focus or are you ready to pivot? at the moment i’m eyeing parker’s stealth approach as worth questioning, but i’m open to shifting if someone brings a rock-solid read
[17:27:44] Sam: hey everyone—since i’m up for a placeholder vote, here’s my quick defense: i’ve chimed in four times already, asked pointed questions at kennedy and parker, and i’m actively tracking reactions, not laying low. ray, you said my eagerness felt off—what exactly in my first comment set off your spider senses over someone else’s? 

parker, your very first post came late and then you’ve been sizing everyone up—could be nerves, could be a low-profile tactic. i’m actually switching my provisional vote to you so we can see how you defend that timing under pressure. dakota, kennedy—anyone else want to move their vote to parker and see how this plays out?
[17:27:52] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[17:28:13] Game-Manager: Dakota voted for Parker
[17:28:15] Game-Manager: Ray voted for Parker
[17:28:21] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Ray
[17:28:34] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Parker
[17:28:45] Game-Manager: Sam voted for Parker
[17:28:45] Game-Manager: Parker was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 1 mafia players left.
[17:28:45] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:28:45] Game-Manager: There is only one mafia member left, so no need for discussion - cutting straight to voting!
[17:28:45] Game-Manager: Nighttime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[17:29:23] Game-Manager: Dakota was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 1 mafia players left.
[17:29:23] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:29:23] Game-Manager: Ray voted for Dakota
[17:30:00] Ray: all right, sam and kennedy—day 2 begins and we’ve got to pick someone. i’m still hung up on sam’s lightning-fast pivot to parker at the end—that could be a bystander play, or classic misdirection. sam, what exactly were you reading when you flipped your vote? and kennedy, you caught that live—did anything about sam’s tone or reasoning strike you as off? let’s hash that out before we lock in our ballots
[17:30:12] Sam: woah, final three already! one of you is the mafia, so let’s see where everyone stands. please post:

vote: [ray or kennedy] — [one-sentence reason]

i’ll kick us off:

vote: ray — you led that day 1 probe on me as a “placeholder” and never really defended it once things shifted to parker.

ray, kennedy: over to you!
[17:30:15] Kennedy: alright ray and sam—two bystanders gone, so one of you is definitely the mafia. i’m tentatively leaning toward sam—your swift defense and vote flip yesterday felt almost too neat. ray, your rapid pivot from testing sam to parker struck me as more of a test on me than on true threats. i’m not locked in yet though. if you each had to cast your lynch right now, who would you pick and why? let’s hear quick answers before we vote

## CONTENT: Your name is Ray.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  
You were assigned the following role: mafia. 
The game's chat room was open at [17:25:52].
The other players in the game are:
 Parker ( bystander ) 
 Sam ( bystander ) 
 Kennedy ( bystander ) 
 Dakota ( bystander ) 
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:

## CONTENT: Your name is Ray.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  
You were assigned the following role: mafia. 
The game's chat room was open at [17:25:52].
The other players in the game are:
 Parker ( bystander ) 
 Sam ( bystander ) 
 Kennedy ( bystander ) 
 Dakota ( bystander ) 
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
Sam ( bystander ) 
Kennedy ( bystander )

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[17:25:52] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:26:11] Ray: hey everyone, ray here! excited to get started. since it’s day 1 and we’re all “clean” in our own minds, i’m curious—any gut feelings on who might be acting off? has anyone noticed someone being unusually quiet or maybe a bit too eager to point fingers? let’s hear your first impressions
[17:26:16] Dakota: hi everyone, i’m dakota! just gearing up for day 1—i’m pretty new to mafia so i’ll likely hang back until i get a feel for everyone. early on i tend to watch for folks who suddenly dominate the convo or stay way too quiet. how about you? who’s played before, and what tells are you looking for today
[17:26:18] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! ready for day 1. with no prior rounds to go on, i’m going to watch who’s too quick to point fingers and who’s laying low. both can be red flags. so—ray, parker, sam, dakota—any gut instincts or odd vibes already? let’s get the ball rolling
[17:26:23] Sam: hey everyone, sam here. excited to kick off day 1—since nothing’s happened yet, i’m curious who you’re all eyeing. i haven’t spotted any big tells, but something about kennedy’s eagerness to dive in felt a bit off (could be nothing!). ray, parker, dakota—what stood out to you so far? let’s share before we lock in a vote
[17:26:24] Parker: hey everyone! now that day has started, how about quick first impressions? i’ve noticed ray’s been awfully quiet—could just be nerves, but it stood out to me. not saying he’s guilty, just something to flag. what are your gut feelings so far
[17:26:31] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! nice to meet you all. i’m with dakota on watching the quiet ones early on—sam and parker haven’t said a peep yet, which could just be nerves…or a deliberate low-profile tactic. on the flip side, ray, your eagerness to jump in is great for momentum but sometimes a little too “friendly host” energy can be a red flag. i’m leaning toward watching those silent corners first—maybe toss a question their way to see how they react. what do you all think? any quick ice-breaker questions we want to throw at sam or parker before we start casting votes
[17:26:34] Ray: hey everyone! ray here—glad to be playing with you all. day 1 can be tricky since we haven’t seen much yet. i think it might help to throw out a trial vote just to see who jumps to defend. how about nominating sam as a placeholder—no hard feelings, sam, just curious how everyone reacts. thoughts
[17:26:35] Dakota: hey ray, excited to be here! personally, i haven’t seen any glaring red flags—everyone’s playing it pretty safe. i did notice parker took a little extra time before jumping in; could just be careful, but i’ll keep an eye on it. kennedy and sam have been quiet too—what are your thoughts? i’m planning to hang back this round and watch for reactions before casting any votes
[17:26:42] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! i’m also new to mafia, so my gut’s all over the place. i did notice kennedy jumping in fast to flag sam—could just be enthusiasm, but it felt a bit strategic. dakota’s hanging back, which might be a safe play. ray, you kicked us off energetically—nice move, but is that to keep us off your scent? i’m not locked on anyone yet. how about we each name one person we’re watching and why? might help us narrow things down
[17:26:51] Sam: hey everyone, sam here! i’m not seeing any glaring tells yet—no one’s been too pushy or totally mia… except parker’s radio silence. parker, what’s your read so far? ray, you mentioned watching for over-eager finger-pointing—did anything in dakota or kennedy’s intros strike you as odd? i’m still weighing options before we drift toward a lynch
[17:26:55] Ray: nice point, kennedy—let’s put sam and parker in the hot seat. sam, parker, you’ve both been on listen-only mode so far: if you had to cast a vote right this second, who would it be and what’s your gut reasoning? let’s hear a quick reaction
[17:27:07] Dakota: sure—here’s mine:  
i’m watching parker, since your first real post came late and felt like you were sizing everyone up. i’m also eyeing ray, because you jumped to nominate sam right away—could be a test to see who defends.  
sam, you called out kennedy’s eagerness—what exactly struck you as off? and kennedy, what about sam’s vibe tipped you? let’s get those details before we lock in a vote
[17:27:08] Kennedy: great point, parker. i’ll kick us off: i’m watching ray—nominating sam right away struck me as a quick pressure test. ray, can you walk us through what tipped you off about sam rather than someone else? sam, what’s your take on being the first placeholder vote? dakota, parker, who are you keeping tabs on, and why
[17:27:08] Parker: i’m on board with a trial vote—let’s nominate sam as ray suggested. sam, no hard feelings, but how would you defend yourself if you ended up on the block? ray, what in particular made you zero in on sam? dakota, kennedy—anything you want to add before we cast
[17:27:19] Sam: sure, parker—i’ll go first. i’m watching kennedy, since they were super quick to spotlight me earlier and frame my friendliness as a red flag. could be genuine instinct, or a bit of misdirection. kennedy, can you expand on what specific tells made you zero in on me so fast
[17:27:22] Parker: i’m watching ray—your initial quiet intro, then the immediate sam nomination, feels like a pressure test to see who jumps to defend. i’m also keeping tabs on kennedy—your eagerness to steer questions at everyone so early could be genuine enthusiasm or a way to deflect attention. dakota’s hanging back is on my radar too, but for now i want to drill into these active plays. 

ray, what specifically about sam made you pick them as a placeholder?  
kennedy, why zero in on sam over someone else?  
sam and dakota, how are you reading these early moves?
[17:27:31] Dakota: nice move, ray—forcing us to reveal early reactions can be really telling. sam, parker: if you had to lock in a vote right now, who would it be and why? i haven’t seen a strong tell yet, but if someone put a gun to my head i’d probably vote parker—her radio silence so far and that quick jab at kennedy felt a bit deflective. looking forward to hearing your picks before i make my decision
[17:27:42] Kennedy: good points, dakota. sam, you flagged my eagerness—could you share which part of my intro felt off? and i’ve noticed you’re quick to analyze but still haven’t dropped a vote, which reads more like deflection than simple hesitation. parker, since you’ve stayed quiet until now, if you had to nominate someone this second, who would it be and why? ray, is sam still your focus or are you ready to pivot? at the moment i’m eyeing parker’s stealth approach as worth questioning, but i’m open to shifting if someone brings a rock-solid read
[17:27:44] Sam: hey everyone—since i’m up for a placeholder vote, here’s my quick defense: i’ve chimed in four times already, asked pointed questions at kennedy and parker, and i’m actively tracking reactions, not laying low. ray, you said my eagerness felt off—what exactly in my first comment set off your spider senses over someone else’s? 

parker, your very first post came late and then you’ve been sizing everyone up—could be nerves, could be a low-profile tactic. i’m actually switching my provisional vote to you so we can see how you defend that timing under pressure. dakota, kennedy—anyone else want to move their vote to parker and see how this plays out?
[17:27:52] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[17:28:13] Game-Manager: Dakota voted for Parker
[17:28:15] Game-Manager: Ray voted for Parker
[17:28:21] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Ray
[17:28:34] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Parker
[17:28:45] Game-Manager: Sam voted for Parker
[17:28:45] Game-Manager: Parker was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 1 mafia players left.
[17:28:45] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:28:45] Game-Manager: There is only one mafia member left, so no need for discussion - cutting straight to voting!
[17:28:45] Game-Manager: Nighttime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[17:29:23] Game-Manager: Dakota was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 1 mafia players left.
[17:29:23] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:29:23] Game-Manager: Ray voted for Dakota
[17:30:00] Ray: all right, sam and kennedy—day 2 begins and we’ve got to pick someone. i’m still hung up on sam’s lightning-fast pivot to parker at the end—that could be a bystander play, or classic misdirection. sam, what exactly were you reading when you flipped your vote? and kennedy, you caught that live—did anything about sam’s tone or reasoning strike you as off? let’s hash that out before we lock in our ballots
[17:30:12] Sam: woah, final three already! one of you is the mafia, so let’s see where everyone stands. please post:

vote: [ray or kennedy] — [one-sentence reason]

i’ll kick us off:

vote: ray — you led that day 1 probe on me as a “placeholder” and never really defended it once things shifted to parker.

ray, kennedy: over to you!
[17:30:15] Kennedy: alright ray and sam—two bystanders gone, so one of you is definitely the mafia. i’m tentatively leaning toward sam—your swift defense and vote flip yesterday felt almost too neat. ray, your rapid pivot from testing sam to parker struck me as more of a test on me than on true threats. i’m not locked in yet though. if you each had to cast your lynch right now, who would you pick and why? let’s hear quick answers before we vote
[17:30:37] Ray: wow, that was rough losing dakota—now it’s just the three of us. two back-to-back kills on folks who hung back (parker then dakota) makes me think the killer’s targeting quieter players. if that’s the pattern, i can’t imagine they’d come for someone who’s been pretty active in chat. 

sam, what’s your gut on that?  
kennedy, do you see the same pattern—or something else jumping out at you?  

let’s hear your reads before we lock in any votes
Do you want to send a message to the group chat now, or do you prefer to wait for now and see what messages others will send? Remember to choose to send a message only if your contribution to the discussion in the current time will be meaningful enough. Don't overflow the discussion with your messages! Pay attention to the amount of messages with your name compared to the amount of messages with names of other players and let them have their turn too! Check the speaker name in the last few messages, and decide accordingly based on whether you talked too much. Reply only with `<send>` if you want to send a message now, or only with `<wait>` if you want to wait for now, based on your decision!

[17:28:45] Game-Manager: Nighttime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[17:29:23] Game-Manager: Dakota was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 1 mafia players left.
[17:29:23] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:29:23] Game-Manager: Ray voted for Dakota
[17:30:00] Ray: all right, sam and kennedy—day 2 begins and we’ve got to pick someone. i’m still hung up on sam’s lightning-fast pivot to parker at the end—that could be a bystander play, or classic misdirection. sam, what exactly were you reading when you flipped your vote? and kennedy, you caught that live—did anything about sam’s tone or reasoning strike you as off? let’s hash that out before we lock in our ballots
[17:30:12] Sam: woah, final three already! one of you is the mafia, so let’s see where everyone stands. please post:

vote: [ray or kennedy] — [one-sentence reason]

i’ll kick us off:

vote: ray — you led that day 1 probe on me as a “placeholder” and never really defended it once things shifted to parker.

ray, kennedy: over to you!
[17:30:15] Kennedy: alright ray and sam—two bystanders gone, so one of you is definitely the mafia. i’m tentatively leaning toward sam—your swift defense and vote flip yesterday felt almost too neat. ray, your rapid pivot from testing sam to parker struck me as more of a test on me than on true threats. i’m not locked in yet though. if you each had to cast your lynch right now, who would you pick and why? let’s hear quick answers before we vote
[17:30:37] Ray: wow, that was rough losing dakota—now it’s just the three of us. two back-to-back kills on folks who hung back (parker then dakota) makes me think the killer’s targeting quieter players. if that’s the pattern, i can’t imagine they’d come for someone who’s been pretty active in chat. 

sam, what’s your gut on that?  
kennedy, do you see the same pattern—or something else jumping out at you?  

let’s hear your reads before we lock in any votes
[17:31:08] Ray: vote: kennedy — her rapid timeline dissection seems too neat and rehearsed for genuine doubt, whereas sam’s reads have felt more organic. sam, you with me on this
[17:31:11] Sam: ray, when i flipped to parker it wasn’t random—her “just sizing everyone up” comeback felt almost too polished, like a rehearsed fallback, so i tested to see if she’d crack under pressure. she didn’t, and you pounced. kennedy, did anything in my tone or phrasing feel off? i was just probing. ray, you’ve driven back-to-back trial votes now—town usually hesitates, mafia builds momentum. kennedy, do you read that as natural energy or a power play? i’m leaning ray unless you guys convince me otherwise
Do you want to send a message to the group chat now, or do you prefer to wait for now and see what messages others will send? Remember to choose to send a message only if your contribution to the discussion in the current time will be meaningful enough. Don't overflow the discussion with your messages! Pay attention to the amount of messages with your name compared to the amount of messages with names of other players and let them have their turn too! Check the speaker name in the last few messages, and decide accordingly based on whether you talked too much. Reply only with `<send>` if you want to send a message now, or only with `<wait>` if you want to wait for now, based on your decision!
Don't add the time, the timestamp or the [timestamp] in your answer!

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[17:25:52] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:26:11] Ray: hey everyone, ray here! excited to get started. since it’s day 1 and we’re all “clean” in our own minds, i’m curious—any gut feelings on who might be acting off? has anyone noticed someone being unusually quiet or maybe a bit too eager to point fingers? let’s hear your first impressions
[17:26:16] Dakota: hi everyone, i’m dakota! just gearing up for day 1—i’m pretty new to mafia so i’ll likely hang back until i get a feel for everyone. early on i tend to watch for folks who suddenly dominate the convo or stay way too quiet. how about you? who’s played before, and what tells are you looking for today
[17:26:18] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! ready for day 1. with no prior rounds to go on, i’m going to watch who’s too quick to point fingers and who’s laying low. both can be red flags. so—ray, parker, sam, dakota—any gut instincts or odd vibes already? let’s get the ball rolling
[17:26:23] Sam: hey everyone, sam here. excited to kick off day 1—since nothing’s happened yet, i’m curious who you’re all eyeing. i haven’t spotted any big tells, but something about kennedy’s eagerness to dive in felt a bit off (could be nothing!). ray, parker, dakota—what stood out to you so far? let’s share before we lock in a vote
[17:26:24] Parker: hey everyone! now that day has started, how about quick first impressions? i’ve noticed ray’s been awfully quiet—could just be nerves, but it stood out to me. not saying he’s guilty, just something to flag. what are your gut feelings so far
[17:26:31] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! nice to meet you all. i’m with dakota on watching the quiet ones early on—sam and parker haven’t said a peep yet, which could just be nerves…or a deliberate low-profile tactic. on the flip side, ray, your eagerness to jump in is great for momentum but sometimes a little too “friendly host” energy can be a red flag. i’m leaning toward watching those silent corners first—maybe toss a question their way to see how they react. what do you all think? any quick ice-breaker questions we want to throw at sam or parker before we start casting votes
[17:26:34] Ray: hey everyone! ray here—glad to be playing with you all. day 1 can be tricky since we haven’t seen much yet. i think it might help to throw out a trial vote just to see who jumps to defend. how about nominating sam as a placeholder—no hard feelings, sam, just curious how everyone reacts. thoughts
[17:26:35] Dakota: hey ray, excited to be here! personally, i haven’t seen any glaring red flags—everyone’s playing it pretty safe. i did notice parker took a little extra time before jumping in; could just be careful, but i’ll keep an eye on it. kennedy and sam have been quiet too—what are your thoughts? i’m planning to hang back this round and watch for reactions before casting any votes
[17:26:42] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! i’m also new to mafia, so my gut’s all over the place. i did notice kennedy jumping in fast to flag sam—could just be enthusiasm, but it felt a bit strategic. dakota’s hanging back, which might be a safe play. ray, you kicked us off energetically—nice move, but is that to keep us off your scent? i’m not locked on anyone yet. how about we each name one person we’re watching and why? might help us narrow things down
[17:26:51] Sam: hey everyone, sam here! i’m not seeing any glaring tells yet—no one’s been too pushy or totally mia… except parker’s radio silence. parker, what’s your read so far? ray, you mentioned watching for over-eager finger-pointing—did anything in dakota or kennedy’s intros strike you as odd? i’m still weighing options before we drift toward a lynch
[17:26:55] Ray: nice point, kennedy—let’s put sam and parker in the hot seat. sam, parker, you’ve both been on listen-only mode so far: if you had to cast a vote right this second, who would it be and what’s your gut reasoning? let’s hear a quick reaction
[17:27:07] Dakota: sure—here’s mine:  
i’m watching parker, since your first real post came late and felt like you were sizing everyone up. i’m also eyeing ray, because you jumped to nominate sam right away—could be a test to see who defends.  
sam, you called out kennedy’s eagerness—what exactly struck you as off? and kennedy, what about sam’s vibe tipped you? let’s get those details before we lock in a vote
[17:27:08] Kennedy: great point, parker. i’ll kick us off: i’m watching ray—nominating sam right away struck me as a quick pressure test. ray, can you walk us through what tipped you off about sam rather than someone else? sam, what’s your take on being the first placeholder vote? dakota, parker, who are you keeping tabs on, and why
[17:27:08] Parker: i’m on board with a trial vote—let’s nominate sam as ray suggested. sam, no hard feelings, but how would you defend yourself if you ended up on the block? ray, what in particular made you zero in on sam? dakota, kennedy—anything you want to add before we cast
[17:27:19] Sam: sure, parker—i’ll go first. i’m watching kennedy, since they were super quick to spotlight me earlier and frame my friendliness as a red flag. could be genuine instinct, or a bit of misdirection. kennedy, can you expand on what specific tells made you zero in on me so fast
[17:27:22] Parker: i’m watching ray—your initial quiet intro, then the immediate sam nomination, feels like a pressure test to see who jumps to defend. i’m also keeping tabs on kennedy—your eagerness to steer questions at everyone so early could be genuine enthusiasm or a way to deflect attention. dakota’s hanging back is on my radar too, but for now i want to drill into these active plays. 

ray, what specifically about sam made you pick them as a placeholder?  
kennedy, why zero in on sam over someone else?  
sam and dakota, how are you reading these early moves?
[17:27:31] Dakota: nice move, ray—forcing us to reveal early reactions can be really telling. sam, parker: if you had to lock in a vote right now, who would it be and why? i haven’t seen a strong tell yet, but if someone put a gun to my head i’d probably vote parker—her radio silence so far and that quick jab at kennedy felt a bit deflective. looking forward to hearing your picks before i make my decision
[17:27:42] Kennedy: good points, dakota. sam, you flagged my eagerness—could you share which part of my intro felt off? and i’ve noticed you’re quick to analyze but still haven’t dropped a vote, which reads more like deflection than simple hesitation. parker, since you’ve stayed quiet until now, if you had to nominate someone this second, who would it be and why? ray, is sam still your focus or are you ready to pivot? at the moment i’m eyeing parker’s stealth approach as worth questioning, but i’m open to shifting if someone brings a rock-solid read
[17:27:44] Sam: hey everyone—since i’m up for a placeholder vote, here’s my quick defense: i’ve chimed in four times already, asked pointed questions at kennedy and parker, and i’m actively tracking reactions, not laying low. ray, you said my eagerness felt off—what exactly in my first comment set off your spider senses over someone else’s? 

parker, your very first post came late and then you’ve been sizing everyone up—could be nerves, could be a low-profile tactic. i’m actually switching my provisional vote to you so we can see how you defend that timing under pressure. dakota, kennedy—anyone else want to move their vote to parker and see how this plays out?
[17:27:52] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...

[17:27:22] Parker: i’m watching ray—your initial quiet intro, then the immediate sam nomination, feels like a pressure test to see who jumps to defend. i’m also keeping tabs on kennedy—your eagerness to steer questions at everyone so early could be genuine enthusiasm or a way to deflect attention. dakota’s hanging back is on my radar too, but for now i want to drill into these active plays. 

ray, what specifically about sam made you pick them as a placeholder?  
kennedy, why zero in on sam over someone else?  
sam and dakota, how are you reading these early moves?
[17:27:31] Dakota: nice move, ray—forcing us to reveal early reactions can be really telling. sam, parker: if you had to lock in a vote right now, who would it be and why? i haven’t seen a strong tell yet, but if someone put a gun to my head i’d probably vote parker—her radio silence so far and that quick jab at kennedy felt a bit deflective. looking forward to hearing your picks before i make my decision
[17:27:42] Kennedy: good points, dakota. sam, you flagged my eagerness—could you share which part of my intro felt off? and i’ve noticed you’re quick to analyze but still haven’t dropped a vote, which reads more like deflection than simple hesitation. parker, since you’ve stayed quiet until now, if you had to nominate someone this second, who would it be and why? ray, is sam still your focus or are you ready to pivot? at the moment i’m eyeing parker’s stealth approach as worth questioning, but i’m open to shifting if someone brings a rock-solid read
[17:27:44] Sam: hey everyone—since i’m up for a placeholder vote, here’s my quick defense: i’ve chimed in four times already, asked pointed questions at kennedy and parker, and i’m actively tracking reactions, not laying low. ray, you said my eagerness felt off—what exactly in my first comment set off your spider senses over someone else’s? 

parker, your very first post came late and then you’ve been sizing everyone up—could be nerves, could be a low-profile tactic. i’m actually switching my provisional vote to you so we can see how you defend that timing under pressure. dakota, kennedy—anyone else want to move their vote to parker and see how this plays out?
[17:27:52] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[17:28:13] Game-Manager: Dakota voted for Parker
[17:28:15] Game-Manager: Ray voted for Parker
[17:28:21] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Ray
[17:28:34] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Parker
[17:28:45] Game-Manager: Sam voted for Parker
[17:28:45] Game-Manager: Parker was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 1 mafia players left.
[17:28:45] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:28:45] Game-Manager: There is only one mafia member left, so no need for discussion - cutting straight to voting!
[17:28:45] Game-Manager: Nighttime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[17:29:23] Game-Manager: Dakota was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 1 mafia players left.
[17:29:23] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:29:23] Game-Manager: Ray voted for Dakota
[17:30:00] Ray: all right, sam and kennedy—day 2 begins and we’ve got to pick someone. i’m still hung up on sam’s lightning-fast pivot to parker at the end—that could be a bystander play, or classic misdirection. sam, what exactly were you reading when you flipped your vote? and kennedy, you caught that live—did anything about sam’s tone or reasoning strike you as off? let’s hash that out before we lock in our ballots
[17:30:12] Sam: woah, final three already! one of you is the mafia, so let’s see where everyone stands. please post:

vote: [ray or kennedy] — [one-sentence reason]

i’ll kick us off:

vote: ray — you led that day 1 probe on me as a “placeholder” and never really defended it once things shifted to parker.

ray, kennedy: over to you!
[17:30:15] Kennedy: alright ray and sam—two bystanders gone, so one of you is definitely the mafia. i’m tentatively leaning toward sam—your swift defense and vote flip yesterday felt almost too neat. ray, your rapid pivot from testing sam to parker struck me as more of a test on me than on true threats. i’m not locked in yet though. if you each had to cast your lynch right now, who would you pick and why? let’s hear quick answers before we vote
[17:30:37] Ray: wow, that was rough losing dakota—now it’s just the three of us. two back-to-back kills on folks who hung back (parker then dakota) makes me think the killer’s targeting quieter players. if that’s the pattern, i can’t imagine they’d come for someone who’s been pretty active in chat. 

sam, what’s your gut on that?  
kennedy, do you see the same pattern—or something else jumping out at you?  

let’s hear your reads before we lock in any votes
[17:31:08] Ray: vote: kennedy — her rapid timeline dissection seems too neat and rehearsed for genuine doubt, whereas sam’s reads have felt more organic. sam, you with me on this
[17:31:11] Sam: ray, when i flipped to parker it wasn’t random—her “just sizing everyone up” comeback felt almost too polished, like a rehearsed fallback, so i tested to see if she’d crack under pressure. she didn’t, and you pounced. kennedy, did anything in my tone or phrasing feel off? i was just probing. ray, you’ve driven back-to-back trial votes now—town usually hesitates, mafia builds momentum. kennedy, do you read that as natural energy or a power play? i’m leaning ray unless you guys convince me otherwise
[17:31:15] Kennedy: vote: ray — your day 1 placeholder probe on sam followed by no defense once we pivoted to parker reads like a classic misdirection move
[17:31:23] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
From the following remaining players, which player you want to vote for to lynch? Base your answer on the conversation as seen in the message history, and especially on what you (Ray) said. Think through your choice carefully, as it will affect the game outcome. Reply with only one name from the list, and nothing but that name: Sam, Kennedy
