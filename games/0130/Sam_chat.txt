[17:26:23] Sam: hey everyone, sam here. excited to kick off day 1—since nothing’s happened yet, i’m curious who you’re all eyeing. i haven’t spotted any big tells, but something about kennedy’s eagerness to dive in felt a bit off (could be nothing!). ray, parker, dakota—what stood out to you so far? let’s share before we lock in a vote
[17:26:51] Sam: hey everyone, sam here! i’m not seeing any glaring tells yet—no one’s been too pushy or totally mia… except parker’s radio silence. parker, what’s your read so far? ray, you mentioned watching for over-eager finger-pointing—did anything in dakota or kennedy’s intros strike you as odd? i’m still weighing options before we drift toward a lynch
[17:27:19] Sam: sure, parker—i’ll go first. i’m watching kennedy, since they were super quick to spotlight me earlier and frame my friendliness as a red flag. could be genuine instinct, or a bit of misdirection. kennedy, can you expand on what specific tells made you zero in on me so fast
[17:27:44] Sam: hey everyone—since i’m up for a placeholder vote, here’s my quick defense: i’ve chimed in four times already, asked pointed questions at kennedy and parker, and i’m actively tracking reactions, not laying low. ray, you said my eagerness felt off—what exactly in my first comment set off your spider senses over someone else’s? 

parker, your very first post came late and then you’ve been sizing everyone up—could be nerves, could be a low-profile tactic. i’m actually switching my provisional vote to you so we can see how you defend that timing under pressure. dakota, kennedy—anyone else want to move their vote to parker and see how this plays out?
[17:30:12] Sam: woah, final three already! one of you is the mafia, so let’s see where everyone stands. please post:

vote: [ray or kennedy] — [one-sentence reason]

i’ll kick us off:

vote: ray — you led that day 1 probe on me as a “placeholder” and never really defended it once things shifted to parker.

ray, kennedy: over to you!
[17:31:11] Sam: ray, when i flipped to parker it wasn’t random—her “just sizing everyone up” comeback felt almost too polished, like a rehearsed fallback, so i tested to see if she’d crack under pressure. she didn’t, and you pounced. kennedy, did anything in my tone or phrasing feel off? i was just probing. ray, you’ve driven back-to-back trial votes now—town usually hesitates, mafia builds momentum. kennedy, do you read that as natural energy or a power play? i’m leaning ray unless you guys convince me otherwise
