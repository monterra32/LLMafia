[17:26:24] Parker: hey everyone! now that day has started, how about quick first impressions? i’ve noticed ray’s been awfully quiet—could just be nerves, but it stood out to me. not saying he’s guilty, just something to flag. what are your gut feelings so far
[17:26:42] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! i’m also new to mafia, so my gut’s all over the place. i did notice kennedy jumping in fast to flag sam—could just be enthusiasm, but it felt a bit strategic. dakota’s hanging back, which might be a safe play. ray, you kicked us off energetically—nice move, but is that to keep us off your scent? i’m not locked on anyone yet. how about we each name one person we’re watching and why? might help us narrow things down
[17:27:08] Parker: i’m on board with a trial vote—let’s nominate sam as ray suggested. sam, no hard feelings, but how would you defend yourself if you ended up on the block? ray, what in particular made you zero in on sam? dakota, kennedy—anything you want to add before we cast
[17:27:22] Parker: i’m watching ray—your initial quiet intro, then the immediate sam nomination, feels like a pressure test to see who jumps to defend. i’m also keeping tabs on kennedy—your eagerness to steer questions at everyone so early could be genuine enthusiasm or a way to deflect attention. dakota’s hanging back is on my radar too, but for now i want to drill into these active plays. 

ray, what specifically about sam made you pick them as a placeholder?  
kennedy, why zero in on sam over someone else?  
sam and dakota, how are you reading these early moves?
