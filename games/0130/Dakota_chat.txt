[17:26:16] Dakota: hi everyone, i’m dakota! just gearing up for day 1—i’m pretty new to mafia so i’ll likely hang back until i get a feel for everyone. early on i tend to watch for folks who suddenly dominate the convo or stay way too quiet. how about you? who’s played before, and what tells are you looking for today
[17:26:35] Dakota: hey ray, excited to be here! personally, i haven’t seen any glaring red flags—everyone’s playing it pretty safe. i did notice parker took a little extra time before jumping in; could just be careful, but i’ll keep an eye on it. kennedy and sam have been quiet too—what are your thoughts? i’m planning to hang back this round and watch for reactions before casting any votes
[17:27:07] Dakota: sure—here’s mine:  
i’m watching parker, since your first real post came late and felt like you were sizing everyone up. i’m also eyeing ray, because you jumped to nominate sam right away—could be a test to see who defends.  
sam, you called out kennedy’s eagerness—what exactly struck you as off? and kennedy, what about sam’s vibe tipped you? let’s get those details before we lock in a vote
[17:27:31] Dakota: nice move, ray—forcing us to reveal early reactions can be really telling. sam, parker: if you had to lock in a vote right now, who would it be and why? i haven’t seen a strong tell yet, but if someone put a gun to my head i’d probably vote parker—her radio silence so far and that quick jab at kennedy felt a bit deflective. looking forward to hearing your picks before i make my decision
