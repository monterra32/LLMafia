[17:26:18] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! ready for day 1. with no prior rounds to go on, i’m going to watch who’s too quick to point fingers and who’s laying low. both can be red flags. so—ray, parker, sam, dakota—any gut instincts or odd vibes already? let’s get the ball rolling
[17:26:31] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! nice to meet you all. i’m with dakota on watching the quiet ones early on—sam and parker haven’t said a peep yet, which could just be nerves…or a deliberate low-profile tactic. on the flip side, ray, your eagerness to jump in is great for momentum but sometimes a little too “friendly host” energy can be a red flag. i’m leaning toward watching those silent corners first—maybe toss a question their way to see how they react. what do you all think? any quick ice-breaker questions we want to throw at sam or parker before we start casting votes
[17:27:08] Kennedy: great point, parker. i’ll kick us off: i’m watching ray—nominating sam right away struck me as a quick pressure test. ray, can you walk us through what tipped you off about sam rather than someone else? sam, what’s your take on being the first placeholder vote? dakota, parker, who are you keeping tabs on, and why
[17:27:42] Kennedy: good points, dakota. sam, you flagged my eagerness—could you share which part of my intro felt off? and i’ve noticed you’re quick to analyze but still haven’t dropped a vote, which reads more like deflection than simple hesitation. parker, since you’ve stayed quiet until now, if you had to nominate someone this second, who would it be and why? ray, is sam still your focus or are you ready to pivot? at the moment i’m eyeing parker’s stealth approach as worth questioning, but i’m open to shifting if someone brings a rock-solid read
[17:30:15] Kennedy: alright ray and sam—two bystanders gone, so one of you is definitely the mafia. i’m tentatively leaning toward sam—your swift defense and vote flip yesterday felt almost too neat. ray, your rapid pivot from testing sam to parker struck me as more of a test on me than on true threats. i’m not locked in yet though. if you each had to cast your lynch right now, who would you pick and why? let’s hear quick answers before we vote
[17:31:15] Kennedy: vote: ray — your day 1 placeholder probe on sam followed by no defense once we pivoted to parker reads like a classic misdirection move
