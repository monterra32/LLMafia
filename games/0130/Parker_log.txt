## CONTENT: You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  + 
 + Do you understand the rules? +

[17:26:23] Sam: hey everyone, sam here. excited to kick off day 1—since nothing’s happened yet, i’m curious who you’re all eyeing. i haven’t spotted any big tells, but something about kennedy’s eagerness to dive in felt a bit off (could be nothing!). ray, parker, dakota—what stood out to you so far? let’s share before we lock in a vote

[17:26:16] Dakota: hi everyone, i’m dakota! just gearing up for day 1—i’m pretty new to mafia so i’ll likely hang back until i get a feel for everyone. early on i tend to watch for folks who suddenly dominate the convo or stay way too quiet. how about you? who’s played before, and what tells are you looking for today
[17:26:18] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! ready for day 1. with no prior rounds to go on, i’m going to watch who’s too quick to point fingers and who’s laying low. both can be red flags. so—ray, parker, sam, dakota—any gut instincts or odd vibes already? let’s get the ball rolling

[17:26:23] Sam: hey everyone, sam here. excited to kick off day 1—since nothing’s happened yet, i’m curious who you’re all eyeing. i haven’t spotted any big tells, but something about kennedy’s eagerness to dive in felt a bit off (could be nothing!). ray, parker, dakota—what stood out to you so far? let’s share before we lock in a vote
[17:26:24] Parker: hey everyone! now that day has started, how about quick first impressions? i’ve noticed ray’s been awfully quiet—could just be nerves, but it stood out to me. not saying he’s guilty, just something to flag. what are your gut feelings so far
[17:26:31] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! nice to meet you all. i’m with dakota on watching the quiet ones early on—sam and parker haven’t said a peep yet, which could just be nerves…or a deliberate low-profile tactic. on the flip side, ray, your eagerness to jump in is great for momentum but sometimes a little too “friendly host” energy can be a red flag. i’m leaning toward watching those silent corners first—maybe toss a question their way to see how they react. what do you all think? any quick ice-breaker questions we want to throw at sam or parker before we start casting votes
[17:26:34] Ray: hey everyone! ray here—glad to be playing with you all. day 1 can be tricky since we haven’t seen much yet. i think it might help to throw out a trial vote just to see who jumps to defend. how about nominating sam as a placeholder—no hard feelings, sam, just curious how everyone reacts. thoughts
[17:26:35] Dakota: hey ray, excited to be here! personally, i haven’t seen any glaring red flags—everyone’s playing it pretty safe. i did notice parker took a little extra time before jumping in; could just be careful, but i’ll keep an eye on it. kennedy and sam have been quiet too—what are your thoughts? i’m planning to hang back this round and watch for reactions before casting any votes

The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  
You were assigned the following role: bystander.

[17:25:52] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:26:11] Ray: hey everyone, ray here! excited to get started. since it’s day 1 and we’re all “clean” in our own minds, i’m curious—any gut feelings on who might be acting off? has anyone noticed someone being unusually quiet or maybe a bit too eager to point fingers? let’s hear your first impressions
[17:26:16] Dakota: hi everyone, i’m dakota! just gearing up for day 1—i’m pretty new to mafia so i’ll likely hang back until i get a feel for everyone. early on i tend to watch for folks who suddenly dominate the convo or stay way too quiet. how about you? who’s played before, and what tells are you looking for today

[17:26:24] Parker: hey everyone! now that day has started, how about quick first impressions? i’ve noticed ray’s been awfully quiet—could just be nerves, but it stood out to me. not saying he’s guilty, just something to flag. what are your gut feelings so far
[17:26:31] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! nice to meet you all. i’m with dakota on watching the quiet ones early on—sam and parker haven’t said a peep yet, which could just be nerves…or a deliberate low-profile tactic. on the flip side, ray, your eagerness to jump in is great for momentum but sometimes a little too “friendly host” energy can be a red flag. i’m leaning toward watching those silent corners first—maybe toss a question their way to see how they react. what do you all think? any quick ice-breaker questions we want to throw at sam or parker before we start casting votes

[17:26:42] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! i’m also new to mafia, so my gut’s all over the place. i did notice kennedy jumping in fast to flag sam—could just be enthusiasm, but it felt a bit strategic. dakota’s hanging back, which might be a safe play. ray, you kicked us off energetically—nice move, but is that to keep us off your scent? i’m not locked on anyone yet. how about we each name one person we’re watching and why? might help us narrow things down
[17:26:51] Sam: hey everyone, sam here! i’m not seeing any glaring tells yet—no one’s been too pushy or totally mia… except parker’s radio silence. parker, what’s your read so far? ray, you mentioned watching for over-eager finger-pointing—did anything in dakota or kennedy’s intros strike you as odd? i’m still weighing options before we drift toward a lynch
[17:26:55] Ray: nice point, kennedy—let’s put sam and parker in the hot seat. sam, parker, you’ve both been on listen-only mode so far: if you had to cast a vote right this second, who would it be and what’s your gut reasoning? let’s hear a quick reaction
[17:27:07] Dakota: sure—here’s mine:  
i’m watching parker, since your first real post came late and felt like you were sizing everyone up. i’m also eyeing ray, because you jumped to nominate sam right away—could be a test to see who defends.  
sam, you called out kennedy’s eagerness—what exactly struck you as off? and kennedy, what about sam’s vibe tipped you? let’s get those details before we lock in a vote
[17:27:08] Kennedy: great point, parker. i’ll kick us off: i’m watching ray—nominating sam right away struck me as a quick pressure test. ray, can you walk us through what tipped you off about sam rather than someone else? sam, what’s your take on being the first placeholder vote? dakota, parker, who are you keeping tabs on, and why

The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  
You were assigned the following role: bystander.

[17:25:52] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:26:11] Ray: hey everyone, ray here! excited to get started. since it’s day 1 and we’re all “clean” in our own minds, i’m curious—any gut feelings on who might be acting off? has anyone noticed someone being unusually quiet or maybe a bit too eager to point fingers? let’s hear your first impressions
[17:26:16] Dakota: hi everyone, i’m dakota! just gearing up for day 1—i’m pretty new to mafia so i’ll likely hang back until i get a feel for everyone. early on i tend to watch for folks who suddenly dominate the convo or stay way too quiet. how about you? who’s played before, and what tells are you looking for today
[17:26:18] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! ready for day 1. with no prior rounds to go on, i’m going to watch who’s too quick to point fingers and who’s laying low. both can be red flags. so—ray, parker, sam, dakota—any gut instincts or odd vibes already? let’s get the ball rolling
[17:26:23] Sam: hey everyone, sam here. excited to kick off day 1—since nothing’s happened yet, i’m curious who you’re all eyeing. i haven’t spotted any big tells, but something about kennedy’s eagerness to dive in felt a bit off (could be nothing!). ray, parker, dakota—what stood out to you so far? let’s share before we lock in a vote
[17:26:24] Parker: hey everyone! now that day has started, how about quick first impressions? i’ve noticed ray’s been awfully quiet—could just be nerves, but it stood out to me. not saying he’s guilty, just something to flag. what are your gut feelings so far
[17:26:31] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! nice to meet you all. i’m with dakota on watching the quiet ones early on—sam and parker haven’t said a peep yet, which could just be nerves…or a deliberate low-profile tactic. on the flip side, ray, your eagerness to jump in is great for momentum but sometimes a little too “friendly host” energy can be a red flag. i’m leaning toward watching those silent corners first—maybe toss a question their way to see how they react. what do you all think? any quick ice-breaker questions we want to throw at sam or parker before we start casting votes
[17:26:34] Ray: hey everyone! ray here—glad to be playing with you all. day 1 can be tricky since we haven’t seen much yet. i think it might help to throw out a trial vote just to see who jumps to defend. how about nominating sam as a placeholder—no hard feelings, sam, just curious how everyone reacts. thoughts
[17:26:35] Dakota: hey ray, excited to be here! personally, i haven’t seen any glaring red flags—everyone’s playing it pretty safe. i did notice parker took a little extra time before jumping in; could just be careful, but i’ll keep an eye on it. kennedy and sam have been quiet too—what are your thoughts? i’m planning to hang back this round and watch for reactions before casting any votes
[17:26:42] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! i’m also new to mafia, so my gut’s all over the place. i did notice kennedy jumping in fast to flag sam—could just be enthusiasm, but it felt a bit strategic. dakota’s hanging back, which might be a safe play. ray, you kicked us off energetically—nice move, but is that to keep us off your scent? i’m not locked on anyone yet. how about we each name one person we’re watching and why? might help us narrow things down

[17:27:19] Sam: sure, parker—i’ll go first. i’m watching kennedy, since they were super quick to spotlight me earlier and frame my friendliness as a red flag. could be genuine instinct, or a bit of misdirection. kennedy, can you expand on what specific tells made you zero in on me so fast

The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  
You were assigned the following role: bystander.

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[17:25:52] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:26:11] Ray: hey everyone, ray here! excited to get started. since it’s day 1 and we’re all “clean” in our own minds, i’m curious—any gut feelings on who might be acting off? has anyone noticed someone being unusually quiet or maybe a bit too eager to point fingers? let’s hear your first impressions
[17:26:16] Dakota: hi everyone, i’m dakota! just gearing up for day 1—i’m pretty new to mafia so i’ll likely hang back until i get a feel for everyone. early on i tend to watch for folks who suddenly dominate the convo or stay way too quiet. how about you? who’s played before, and what tells are you looking for today
[17:26:18] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! ready for day 1. with no prior rounds to go on, i’m going to watch who’s too quick to point fingers and who’s laying low. both can be red flags. so—ray, parker, sam, dakota—any gut instincts or odd vibes already? let’s get the ball rolling
[17:26:23] Sam: hey everyone, sam here. excited to kick off day 1—since nothing’s happened yet, i’m curious who you’re all eyeing. i haven’t spotted any big tells, but something about kennedy’s eagerness to dive in felt a bit off (could be nothing!). ray, parker, dakota—what stood out to you so far? let’s share before we lock in a vote
[17:26:24] Parker: hey everyone! now that day has started, how about quick first impressions? i’ve noticed ray’s been awfully quiet—could just be nerves, but it stood out to me. not saying he’s guilty, just something to flag. what are your gut feelings so far
[17:26:31] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! nice to meet you all. i’m with dakota on watching the quiet ones early on—sam and parker haven’t said a peep yet, which could just be nerves…or a deliberate low-profile tactic. on the flip side, ray, your eagerness to jump in is great for momentum but sometimes a little too “friendly host” energy can be a red flag. i’m leaning toward watching those silent corners first—maybe toss a question their way to see how they react. what do you all think? any quick ice-breaker questions we want to throw at sam or parker before we start casting votes
[17:26:34] Ray: hey everyone! ray here—glad to be playing with you all. day 1 can be tricky since we haven’t seen much yet. i think it might help to throw out a trial vote just to see who jumps to defend. how about nominating sam as a placeholder—no hard feelings, sam, just curious how everyone reacts. thoughts
[17:26:35] Dakota: hey ray, excited to be here! personally, i haven’t seen any glaring red flags—everyone’s playing it pretty safe. i did notice parker took a little extra time before jumping in; could just be careful, but i’ll keep an eye on it. kennedy and sam have been quiet too—what are your thoughts? i’m planning to hang back this round and watch for reactions before casting any votes
[17:26:42] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! i’m also new to mafia, so my gut’s all over the place. i did notice kennedy jumping in fast to flag sam—could just be enthusiasm, but it felt a bit strategic. dakota’s hanging back, which might be a safe play. ray, you kicked us off energetically—nice move, but is that to keep us off your scent? i’m not locked on anyone yet. how about we each name one person we’re watching and why? might help us narrow things down
[17:26:51] Sam: hey everyone, sam here! i’m not seeing any glaring tells yet—no one’s been too pushy or totally mia… except parker’s radio silence. parker, what’s your read so far? ray, you mentioned watching for over-eager finger-pointing—did anything in dakota or kennedy’s intros strike you as odd? i’m still weighing options before we drift toward a lynch
[17:26:55] Ray: nice point, kennedy—let’s put sam and parker in the hot seat. sam, parker, you’ve both been on listen-only mode so far: if you had to cast a vote right this second, who would it be and what’s your gut reasoning? let’s hear a quick reaction
[17:27:07] Dakota: sure—here’s mine:  
i’m watching parker, since your first real post came late and felt like you were sizing everyone up. i’m also eyeing ray, because you jumped to nominate sam right away—could be a test to see who defends.  
sam, you called out kennedy’s eagerness—what exactly struck you as off? and kennedy, what about sam’s vibe tipped you? let’s get those details before we lock in a vote
[17:27:08] Kennedy: great point, parker. i’ll kick us off: i’m watching ray—nominating sam right away struck me as a quick pressure test. ray, can you walk us through what tipped you off about sam rather than someone else? sam, what’s your take on being the first placeholder vote? dakota, parker, who are you keeping tabs on, and why
[17:27:08] Parker: i’m on board with a trial vote—let’s nominate sam as ray suggested. sam, no hard feelings, but how would you defend yourself if you ended up on the block? ray, what in particular made you zero in on sam? dakota, kennedy—anything you want to add before we cast
[17:27:19] Sam: sure, parker—i’ll go first. i’m watching kennedy, since they were super quick to spotlight me earlier and frame my friendliness as a red flag. could be genuine instinct, or a bit of misdirection. kennedy, can you expand on what specific tells made you zero in on me so fast
[17:27:22] Parker: i’m watching ray—your initial quiet intro, then the immediate sam nomination, feels like a pressure test to see who jumps to defend. i’m also keeping tabs on kennedy—your eagerness to steer questions at everyone so early could be genuine enthusiasm or a way to deflect attention. dakota’s hanging back is on my radar too, but for now i want to drill into these active plays. 

ray, what specifically about sam made you pick them as a placeholder?  
kennedy, why zero in on sam over someone else?  
sam and dakota, how are you reading these early moves?
[17:27:31] Dakota: nice move, ray—forcing us to reveal early reactions can be really telling. sam, parker: if you had to lock in a vote right now, who would it be and why? i haven’t seen a strong tell yet, but if someone put a gun to my head i’d probably vote parker—her radio silence so far and that quick jab at kennedy felt a bit deflective. looking forward to hearing your picks before i make my decision
Do you want to send a message to the group chat now, or do you prefer to wait for now and see what messages others will send? Remember to choose to send a message only if your contribution to the discussion in the current time will be meaningful enough. Don't overflow the discussion with your messages! Pay attention to the amount of messages with your name compared to the amount of messages with names of other players and let them have their turn too! Check the speaker name in the last few messages, and decide accordingly based on whether you talked too much. Reply only with `<send>` if you want to send a message now, or only with `<wait>` if you want to wait for now, based on your decision!

[17:26:31] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! nice to meet you all. i’m with dakota on watching the quiet ones early on—sam and parker haven’t said a peep yet, which could just be nerves…or a deliberate low-profile tactic. on the flip side, ray, your eagerness to jump in is great for momentum but sometimes a little too “friendly host” energy can be a red flag. i’m leaning toward watching those silent corners first—maybe toss a question their way to see how they react. what do you all think? any quick ice-breaker questions we want to throw at sam or parker before we start casting votes
[17:26:34] Ray: hey everyone! ray here—glad to be playing with you all. day 1 can be tricky since we haven’t seen much yet. i think it might help to throw out a trial vote just to see who jumps to defend. how about nominating sam as a placeholder—no hard feelings, sam, just curious how everyone reacts. thoughts
[17:26:35] Dakota: hey ray, excited to be here! personally, i haven’t seen any glaring red flags—everyone’s playing it pretty safe. i did notice parker took a little extra time before jumping in; could just be careful, but i’ll keep an eye on it. kennedy and sam have been quiet too—what are your thoughts? i’m planning to hang back this round and watch for reactions before casting any votes
[17:26:42] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! i’m also new to mafia, so my gut’s all over the place. i did notice kennedy jumping in fast to flag sam—could just be enthusiasm, but it felt a bit strategic. dakota’s hanging back, which might be a safe play. ray, you kicked us off energetically—nice move, but is that to keep us off your scent? i’m not locked on anyone yet. how about we each name one person we’re watching and why? might help us narrow things down
[17:26:51] Sam: hey everyone, sam here! i’m not seeing any glaring tells yet—no one’s been too pushy or totally mia… except parker’s radio silence. parker, what’s your read so far? ray, you mentioned watching for over-eager finger-pointing—did anything in dakota or kennedy’s intros strike you as odd? i’m still weighing options before we drift toward a lynch
[17:26:55] Ray: nice point, kennedy—let’s put sam and parker in the hot seat. sam, parker, you’ve both been on listen-only mode so far: if you had to cast a vote right this second, who would it be and what’s your gut reasoning? let’s hear a quick reaction
[17:27:07] Dakota: sure—here’s mine:  
i’m watching parker, since your first real post came late and felt like you were sizing everyone up. i’m also eyeing ray, because you jumped to nominate sam right away—could be a test to see who defends.  
sam, you called out kennedy’s eagerness—what exactly struck you as off? and kennedy, what about sam’s vibe tipped you? let’s get those details before we lock in a vote
[17:27:08] Kennedy: great point, parker. i’ll kick us off: i’m watching ray—nominating sam right away struck me as a quick pressure test. ray, can you walk us through what tipped you off about sam rather than someone else? sam, what’s your take on being the first placeholder vote? dakota, parker, who are you keeping tabs on, and why
[17:27:08] Parker: i’m on board with a trial vote—let’s nominate sam as ray suggested. sam, no hard feelings, but how would you defend yourself if you ended up on the block? ray, what in particular made you zero in on sam? dakota, kennedy—anything you want to add before we cast
[17:27:19] Sam: sure, parker—i’ll go first. i’m watching kennedy, since they were super quick to spotlight me earlier and frame my friendliness as a red flag. could be genuine instinct, or a bit of misdirection. kennedy, can you expand on what specific tells made you zero in on me so fast
[17:27:22] Parker: i’m watching ray—your initial quiet intro, then the immediate sam nomination, feels like a pressure test to see who jumps to defend. i’m also keeping tabs on kennedy—your eagerness to steer questions at everyone so early could be genuine enthusiasm or a way to deflect attention. dakota’s hanging back is on my radar too, but for now i want to drill into these active plays. 

ray, what specifically about sam made you pick them as a placeholder?  
kennedy, why zero in on sam over someone else?  
sam and dakota, how are you reading these early moves?
[17:27:31] Dakota: nice move, ray—forcing us to reveal early reactions can be really telling. sam, parker: if you had to lock in a vote right now, who would it be and why? i haven’t seen a strong tell yet, but if someone put a gun to my head i’d probably vote parker—her radio silence so far and that quick jab at kennedy felt a bit deflective. looking forward to hearing your picks before i make my decision

## CONTENT: Dakota—before you lock me in, can you clarify which part of my jab at Kennedy felt deflective? I thought I was just pointing out her early eagerness. 

As for me, if I had to cast a vote right now I’m leaning toward Ray—his instant placeholder on Sam felt more like a pressure test than genuine suspicion. Ray, can you walk us through why Sam rather than Kennedy or Parker? 

Sam, you’ve been flagging Kennedy—what specific tells made you zero in on them so fast? 

Kennedy, you were first to spotlight Sam—what stood out to you in Sam’s intro that felt off? 

Let’s nail down those details before we finalize any votes.

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[17:25:52] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:26:11] Ray: hey everyone, ray here! excited to get started. since it’s day 1 and we’re all “clean” in our own minds, i’m curious—any gut feelings on who might be acting off? has anyone noticed someone being unusually quiet or maybe a bit too eager to point fingers? let’s hear your first impressions
[17:26:16] Dakota: hi everyone, i’m dakota! just gearing up for day 1—i’m pretty new to mafia so i’ll likely hang back until i get a feel for everyone. early on i tend to watch for folks who suddenly dominate the convo or stay way too quiet. how about you? who’s played before, and what tells are you looking for today
[17:26:18] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! ready for day 1. with no prior rounds to go on, i’m going to watch who’s too quick to point fingers and who’s laying low. both can be red flags. so—ray, parker, sam, dakota—any gut instincts or odd vibes already? let’s get the ball rolling
[17:26:23] Sam: hey everyone, sam here. excited to kick off day 1—since nothing’s happened yet, i’m curious who you’re all eyeing. i haven’t spotted any big tells, but something about kennedy’s eagerness to dive in felt a bit off (could be nothing!). ray, parker, dakota—what stood out to you so far? let’s share before we lock in a vote
[17:26:24] Parker: hey everyone! now that day has started, how about quick first impressions? i’ve noticed ray’s been awfully quiet—could just be nerves, but it stood out to me. not saying he’s guilty, just something to flag. what are your gut feelings so far
[17:26:31] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! nice to meet you all. i’m with dakota on watching the quiet ones early on—sam and parker haven’t said a peep yet, which could just be nerves…or a deliberate low-profile tactic. on the flip side, ray, your eagerness to jump in is great for momentum but sometimes a little too “friendly host” energy can be a red flag. i’m leaning toward watching those silent corners first—maybe toss a question their way to see how they react. what do you all think? any quick ice-breaker questions we want to throw at sam or parker before we start casting votes
[17:26:34] Ray: hey everyone! ray here—glad to be playing with you all. day 1 can be tricky since we haven’t seen much yet. i think it might help to throw out a trial vote just to see who jumps to defend. how about nominating sam as a placeholder—no hard feelings, sam, just curious how everyone reacts. thoughts

[17:27:42] Kennedy: good points, dakota. sam, you flagged my eagerness—could you share which part of my intro felt off? and i’ve noticed you’re quick to analyze but still haven’t dropped a vote, which reads more like deflection than simple hesitation. parker, since you’ve stayed quiet until now, if you had to nominate someone this second, who would it be and why? ray, is sam still your focus or are you ready to pivot? at the moment i’m eyeing parker’s stealth approach as worth questioning, but i’m open to shifting if someone brings a rock-solid read
[17:27:44] Sam: hey everyone—since i’m up for a placeholder vote, here’s my quick defense: i’ve chimed in four times already, asked pointed questions at kennedy and parker, and i’m actively tracking reactions, not laying low. ray, you said my eagerness felt off—what exactly in my first comment set off your spider senses over someone else’s? 

parker, your very first post came late and then you’ve been sizing everyone up—could be nerves, could be a low-profile tactic. i’m actually switching my provisional vote to you so we can see how you defend that timing under pressure. dakota, kennedy—anyone else want to move their vote to parker and see how this plays out?
[17:27:52] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
From the following remaining players, which player you want to vote for to lynch? Base your answer on the conversation as seen in the message history, and especially on what you (Parker) said. Think through your choice carefully, as it will affect the game outcome. Reply with only one name from the list, and nothing but that name: Ray, Sam, Kennedy, Dakota

The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.
