[11:47:48] Finley: hey everyone, finley here! day 1 can be tough—no obvious scum markers yet. before we jump into accusations, i’d love to hear your gut picks. who’s feeling fishy to you, and what made you pause? i’ll share mine once i see your thoughts
[11:48:25] Finley: hey everyone, finley here! day 1 info famine is brutal, so let’s do a quick round-robin: each of us names one player who’s raising eyebrows. i’ll kick us off—parker’s near-silence is sticking out to me. next up: tyler, who’s your pick? then parker, adrian, sidney, drew, kennedy—let’s hear your gut
[11:48:46] Finley: i’m on board with the round-robin. i’ll kick us off: i’m eyeing parker—was super quiet at first, then jumped right in with that detailed structure proposal. could just be day-one nerves, but it also feels a bit like misdirection. adrian, who’s on your radar and why
[11:50:14] Finley: finley: adrian, fair question—parker’s sudden shift from near-silence to prescribing a rigid 30-second round-robin felt more like agenda control than casual day 1 brainstorming. and sidney’s call on drew rings true too—lots of “vibes” but zero concrete examples. if i had to narrow my sights, i’d be watching parker for forced structure and drew for empty finger-pointing. what do you all think—anyone want to press parker on that timeline or ask drew for specifics
[11:50:49] Finley: okay, parker—you wrote “let’s do a quick round-robin with a 30-second limit per turn so nobody overthinks it,” effectively choreographing our discussion mid-stream. what made you pivot from being quiet to laying out that rigid structure? and drew, your only “concrete” example of sidney’s scummy behavior was her polite “sounds good,” which any of us might’ve said. if neither of you can point to a real misstep beyond process control and vague vibes, i’m ready to start a vote on parker for pushing this agenda so hard. thoughts
[11:51:37] Finley: finley: nice work today, sidney—we got parker out. for our night kill i’m leaning toward drew. he’s been the loudest about “quiet” tells and has zeroed in on you, which makes him our biggest threat. adrian’s kept quieter, and tyler/kennedy aren’t pushing hard against us yet. you good with drew, or would you rather take out someone else
[11:51:54] Finley: sidney, i’m with you on drew—he’s been the loudest about “quiet” tells and especially focused on you, so he’s our biggest threat. i’m locking in drew for tonight’s kill unless you’d rather take out someone else. after he’s gone, we can play up confusion tomorrow and keep the spotlight off us by zeroing in on the quieter players. sound good
[11:52:25] Finley: finley: locking in my kill vote for drew. tomorrow let’s play it cool early, then subtly steer suspicion onto kennedy—she’s been pushing process control and will look sketchy if we nudge it
[11:52:42] Finley: finley: drew’s locked in for tonight’s kill. once he’s gone, let’s stay quiet and let tyler’s radio silence—and kennedy’s hesitant reads—be our next wedge. tomorrow i’ll casually flag tyler’s lack of concrete input and suggest we keep an eye on him. sound good
[11:53:02] Finley: finley: nice work locking in drew. for day 2, here’s what i’m thinking as an opener: i’ll casually say, “hey, was it just me or did kennedy’s 30-second round-robin feel a bit over-engineered for day 1? kinda came off as agenda-setting.” let that sit, then you can chime in with something like, “yeah, i thought it was forced,” and we’ll let the town focus on her. if that doesn’t stick, we can pivot to tyler’s silence as our backup thread. sound good
[11:54:13] Finley: hey everyone—jumping into day 2, i’ve been thinking about our day 1 chat. did anyone else find kennedy’s 30-second round-robin idea a bit over-engineered? it felt more like agenda-setting than casual brainstorming. not accusing, just curious if it struck you as odd too. what do you all think
[11:54:55] Finley: hey everyone—looking back on day 1, did anyone else feel like kennedy’s strict 30-second round-robin was a bit over-engineered? it came off more like agenda-setting than genuine info-gathering. curious what you all think
[11:56:33] Finley: finley: here’s the fresh snippet that set off my spidey sense—when you wrote, “if we can’t point to specific lines, it might just be day 1 jitters,” it felt like a catch-all dodge instead of a real read. that kind of process deflection over substance is sus to me. i’m leaning to vote kennedy today unless someone has a stronger, concrete quote for a different suspect. thoughts
[11:56:59] Finley: tyler, i get why you pulled sidney on process, but that same kind of agenda‐setting has been coming straight from kennedy. her original “how about we go around and have each ‘quiet’ player give us one name they’d vote for right now and a quick why” pitch—and her day 2 opener rehashing it—still hasn’t unearthed a single concrete behavior. that feels like scummy misdirection. i’m switching my vote to kennedy. who’s with me
