[11:47:46] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! day 1 jitters… i think we should start by sharing any initial gut feelings—who’s caught your eye so far? i’ll admit tyler’s silence so far stood out to me, but i could be totally off. how about you all
[11:48:02] Kennedy: hey drew, good point—quiet folks do stand out on day 1. i’d add finley and tyler (and even adrian) to that list—none of them have chimed in yet either. how about we go around and have each “quiet” player give us one name they’d vote for right now and a quick why? that way we’ll see who’s got a gut feeling versus who’s just lurking. parker, sidney, finley, tyler, adrian—want to kick us off? i’ll share mine right after
[11:48:27] Kennedy: hey everyone, i’ll throw in my quick gut: i’m still watching tyler’s quietness, but it’s early and i don’t want to lock in on that alone just yet. i agree we should give it another minute to see if anyone slips up or shifts tone. adrian, you’re up next in sidney’s round‐robin—who’s on your radar and what tipped you off
[11:50:15] Kennedy: kennedy: i’ll throw in mine—drew. you’ve been eager to drive the “quiet = scummy” narrative but haven’t backed it up with any concrete slips or quotes. drew, can you point to one specific message or behavior that really set off alarm bells for you? that’ll help me see if there’s something solid behind the vibe
[11:50:34] Kennedy: kennedy: hey everyone—i’m feeling a bit stuck between parker’s sudden push for that rigid 30-second structure and drew’s vibe-only calls. before we go too deep, can we get a couple concrete examples? 

1. parker, what exact phrase or moment in our earlier chat made you decide to roll out the 30-second round-robin?  
2. drew, can you quote one or two of sidney’s (or anyone’s) messages that struck you as “generic”?

if we can’t point to specific lines, it might just be day 1 jitters. after that, i’m happy to move on—either toward a vote or another light round of questions
[11:54:30] Kennedy: kennedy: okay everyone—losing parker and drew was rough. we’re now five with two mafia left, so let’s get concrete. how about a quick quote exercise? each of us picks one exact line from day 1 chat that felt odd, then adds a one-sentence why. i’ll start: i keyed in on drew’s “vibes” comments—no actual quotes behind it. adrian, you voted for me—what snippet made you pick me? finley, you backed parker—what phrase jumped out? sidney and tyler, then we’ll compare notes
[11:55:13] Kennedy: here’s mine—when finley opened day 2 with “did anyone else find kennedy’s 30-second round-robin idea a bit over-engineered?” it stood out. that line rehashes day 1 process instead of pointing to any concrete behavior or slip from anyone, which feels like a distraction more than a read. i’d expect a real scum tell to come with a specific quote or odd phrasing tied to someone’s logic, not just relitigating how we ran things. finley, what fresh behavior or exact wording today made you raise that flag
[11:55:37] Kennedy: hey tyler—glad to clarify. i pushed for the 30-second turns because on day 1 our convo was getting steered by a few repeat posters before some of us even spoke; i wanted quick gut reads before groupthink set in, not to hog control. sidney—tyler’s got you on his shortlist; if you had to name someone right now, who is it and what exact line or behavior made you pause? once we’ve got that, we can lock in a vote
[11:56:21] Kennedy: tyler—i appreciate the call‐out. my only aim with the 30-second turns was to keep pace and give quieter players (myself included) a chance to speak before a few voices dominated. no hidden agenda there. 

that said, i’m honestly more worried about sidney right now. she’s been exceptionally agreeable—“sounds good,” “fair point”—but hasn’t offered a single direct quote or fresh suspicion today. sidney, what exact line from my posts (or anyone else’s) made you zero in on me? and tyler, can you point us to the precise phrasing you felt was over-engineered? once we’ve got those snippets, we should pick one suspect and vote
[11:57:11] Kennedy: i’m casting my vote for sidney. my anchor is her line “that level of agenda-setting over content still strikes me as odd” — it’s a process jab with zero concrete quote behind it. if we don’t have a better snippet, let’s lock in sidney
