[11:47:59] Sidney: hey everyone—sidney here! excited to get day 1 rolling. to keep us organized, how about a quick round‐robin where each of us names one person we find suspicious and why? i’ll kick us off by asking drew first: drew, who’s on your radar and what tipped you off? after you, we can go adrian, parker, tyler, kennedy in any order you like. your turn
[11:48:25] Sidney: hey everyone, sidney here! sorry for the radio silence—i’ve been catching up on your points. i like parker’s idea of waiting a bit to see who really drives the convo, but i also noticed drew was pretty eager to call out us “quiet ones.” maybe we try a quick round-robin: each of us names one person we find a bit sketchy and why—no vote commitment yet, just gut reads. i can go last. what do you all think
[11:49:04] Sidney: sounds good—let’s keep this to 30 seconds per person like parker suggested. parker, you offered to go first, so who’s your suspect and what’s the quick reason? then i’ll chime in right after
[11:49:33] Sidney: sidney: if i had to name someone right now, i’d say drew. he’s been unusually eager to spotlight “quiet” tells and set up this whole round-robin framework, yet all he’s offered are vague vibes—no concrete examples. that level of narrative control feels more strategic than honest. it’s a pretty weak read, but i’m watching him closely. drew, what do you make of being in the hot seat
[11:50:06] Sidney: sidney: if i had to name someone right now, it’s drew. you’ve been super quick to zoom in on “quiet” folks and push these round-robin setups, but you haven’t offered any concrete reads—just vibes. that feels a bit like scummy misdirection. drew, what specific tells beyond general vibes are making you so sure
[11:50:39] Sidney: sidney: i’ll throw tyler on my watchlist. he’s been quiet all round and then jumped in to back everyone’s structure without giving any reads of his own—it could be nerves, but that level of play-it-safe feels odd. no hard evidence, just something i’m keeping an eye on
[11:51:37] Sidney: sidney: hey finley—nice work locking in parker today. for our night kill i’m leaning toward drew; he’s been driving the convo and is the most dangerous at this point. if you’d rather take out kennedy to spread uncertainty, i’m fine with that too. let me know which you prefer and i’ll cast my vote accordingly. i’ll play quieter tomorrow so we don’t look too coordinated
[11:51:53] Sidney: sidney: i’m with you, finley—drew’s our biggest threat. he’s been driving that “quiet=scummy” narrative hard and will keep painting targets on our backs. let’s lock in drew for tonight’s kill. after that we can pick off whoever starts pushing again—kennedy looks like the next loudest
[11:52:07] Sidney: sidney: i agree, let’s take out drew tonight. he’s been our loudest threat—leading the charge on “quiet equals scum” and zeroing in on me with nothing solid. removing him now keeps the town off-balance. i’m casting my kill vote for drew
[11:52:37] Sidney: finley, i’ve locked in drew for the kill. tomorrow let’s seed that kennedy’s rigid 30-second structure was the real odd play—if anyone asks, i’ll bring up how forced it felt. i’ll play totally quiet in the morning so she stands out if she pushes. good luck
[11:53:04] Sidney: great, drew’s locked in. for tomorrow’s day, let’s stay low-key and seed our targets subtly:

i’ll open with something like, “wow, was that parker lynch too rushed?” to plant doubt, then casually add, “also, adrian barely spoke again—anyone else notice?” you can jump in next and nudge attention toward kennedy’s earlier push for structure. we’ll skip the rigid round-robins and let them squirm in free-form chat. sound good?
[11:53:23] Sidney: finley, sounds perfect. i’ve cast my kill vote on drew. tomorrow i’ll back you up right after your opener—something like “totally agree, kennedy’s 30-second round-robin felt over-engineered, like agenda-setting more than casual day-1 brainstorming.” if that doesn’t stick, i’ll pivot to pointing out tyler’s radio silence and question why he hasn’t offered any concrete reads. that should keep the town off our scent. let me know if you want to tweak anything
[11:54:46] Sidney: sidney: i’m with you, finley—kennedy’s “30-second limit per turn so nobody overthinks it” felt more like agenda-setting than casual brainstorming. it was pretty rigid for day 1 and seemed designed to box us in. did anyone else feel that came off as forced
[11:55:23] Sidney: sidney: here’s mine—when kennedy said “how about we go around and have each ‘quiet’ player give us one name they’d vote for right now and a quick why?” it felt like she was zeroing in on silence rather than observing real behavior, more agenda-setting than genuine. tyler, what quote stuck out to you and why
[11:55:55] Sidney: sidney: if i have to name someone right now, it’s kennedy. her day 1 line “let’s do a quick round-robin with a 30-second limit per turn so nobody overthinks it” felt way too rigid for a first brainstorm, and finley’s day 2 opener just recycled that same wording instead of pointing to fresh behavior. that level of agenda-setting over content still strikes me as odd. adrian, tyler—does that quote stand out to you too, or is there another snippet you’d anchor a suspicion on before we vote
[11:56:25] Sidney: sidney: i’m with tyler on this—kennedy’s line “let’s do a 30-second round-robin so nobody overthinks it” really jumped out at me. it felt like agenda-setting more than an actual read, and she’s doubled down on defending that same tactic today instead of pointing to any concrete behavior. that’s the only real quote we’ve got. i’m planning to vote kennedy unless someone has a stronger snippet—adrian, tyler, what do you think
[11:57:03] Sidney: sidney: i’m ready to lock in kennedy. the exact line that put you on my radar was your day 1 ask: “how about we go around and have each ‘quiet’ player give us one name they’d vote for right now and a quick why?” that singled out silent players instead of flagging any real misbehavior and set the agenda too rigidly. tyler even called out the “30-second limit per turn” echo of that process control. unless someone’s got a stronger concrete snippet, i’m voting kennedy—adrian, tyler, you with me
