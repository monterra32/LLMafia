[11:48:20] Adrian: hey everyone, adrian here! since it’s day 1 and we don’t have any hard reads yet, i’m planning to watch how everyone interacts. maybe we can each share a quick gut-hunch or pose a simple question—like noting odd silences or sudden eagerness to vote. i’m curious who’s feeling the pressure or noticed something off. who wants to kick us off with a thought or question
[11:48:44] Adrian: adrian: i’m on board with the 30-second round-robin. if i have to pick someone, i’ll say kennedy—her push to spotlight the “quiet” folks and steer our process felt a bit forced. it’s a weak read, though. sidney, you’re up next
[11:49:33] Adrian: okay, i’ll throw in my half-baked gut: finley. you kicked off this whole round-robin and zeroed in on parker’s silence right away—just curious what in parker’s messages set off alarm bells for you. can you walk us through that
[11:49:55] Adrian: adrian: i’m still leaning toward kennedy—her eagerness to single out every “quiet” player and steer our process felt a bit forced for day 1. not a killer read, but she’s on my watchlist. sidney, you’re up—who’s on your radar and what tipped you off
[11:50:38] Adrian: adrian: i’ll go first—kennedy, you wrote “how about we go around and have each ‘quiet’ player give us one name they’d vote for right now and a quick why?” that specifically honed in on silent players rather than anything substantive and steered our convo into a narrow frame. what made you push so hard for that setup
[11:54:30] Adrian: hey everyone, tough break losing parker then drew—we’re down to 3 bystanders vs. 2 mafia and can’t afford to drift. let’s do one more quick round where each of us names a top suspect plus the exact quote or behavior that flagged them. i’ll start: i’m still eyeing kennedy—your line “how about we go around and have each ‘quiet’ player give us one name” felt more like steering the convo than offering a read. sidney, you’re up with yours—just one snippet and why, then tyler, then finley. let’s wrap this in two minutes and vote
[11:56:13] Adrian: adrian: alright, let’s shift to actual quotes. kennedy, you wrote “30-second limit per turn so nobody overthinks it”—what were you hoping to uncover there? sidney, you’ve called people “generic” but haven’t given a snippet—what exact line made you feel that way, and who are you targeting now? finley, tyler—any final quote-based reads, or are we ready to vote kennedy on the only solid line we have? i’ll lock in in 30 seconds unless someone has something concrete
[11:56:45] Adrian: i agree with sidney—kennedy’s line “let’s do a quick round-robin with a 30-second limit per turn so nobody overthinks it” really stands out. it was over-engineered agenda-setting on day 1 and even got recycled today instead of any fresh behavioral read. that’s the most concrete prescriptive move i’ve seen, so i’m ready to lock in my vote on kennedy unless someone has a stronger fresh quote
