[11:51:37] Finley: finley: nice work today, sidney—we got parker out. for our night kill i’m leaning toward drew. he’s been the loudest about “quiet” tells and has zeroed in on you, which makes him our biggest threat. adrian’s kept quieter, and tyler/kennedy aren’t pushing hard against us yet. you good with drew, or would you rather take out someone else
[11:51:37] Sidney: sidney: hey finley—nice work locking in parker today. for our night kill i’m leaning toward drew; he’s been driving the convo and is the most dangerous at this point. if you’d rather take out kennedy to spread uncertainty, i’m fine with that too. let me know which you prefer and i’ll cast my vote accordingly. i’ll play quieter tomorrow so we don’t look too coordinated
[11:51:53] Sidney: sidney: i’m with you, finley—drew’s our biggest threat. he’s been driving that “quiet=scummy” narrative hard and will keep painting targets on our backs. let’s lock in drew for tonight’s kill. after that we can pick off whoever starts pushing again—kennedy looks like the next loudest
[11:51:54] Finley: sidney, i’m with you on drew—he’s been the loudest about “quiet” tells and especially focused on you, so he’s our biggest threat. i’m locking in drew for tonight’s kill unless you’d rather take out someone else. after he’s gone, we can play up confusion tomorrow and keep the spotlight off us by zeroing in on the quieter players. sound good
[11:52:07] Sidney: sidney: i agree, let’s take out drew tonight. he’s been our loudest threat—leading the charge on “quiet equals scum” and zeroing in on me with nothing solid. removing him now keeps the town off-balance. i’m casting my kill vote for drew
[11:52:25] Finley: finley: locking in my kill vote for drew. tomorrow let’s play it cool early, then subtly steer suspicion onto kennedy—she’s been pushing process control and will look sketchy if we nudge it
[11:52:37] Sidney: finley, i’ve locked in drew for the kill. tomorrow let’s seed that kennedy’s rigid 30-second structure was the real odd play—if anyone asks, i’ll bring up how forced it felt. i’ll play totally quiet in the morning so she stands out if she pushes. good luck
[11:52:42] Finley: finley: drew’s locked in for tonight’s kill. once he’s gone, let’s stay quiet and let tyler’s radio silence—and kennedy’s hesitant reads—be our next wedge. tomorrow i’ll casually flag tyler’s lack of concrete input and suggest we keep an eye on him. sound good
[11:53:02] Finley: finley: nice work locking in drew. for day 2, here’s what i’m thinking as an opener: i’ll casually say, “hey, was it just me or did kennedy’s 30-second round-robin feel a bit over-engineered for day 1? kinda came off as agenda-setting.” let that sit, then you can chime in with something like, “yeah, i thought it was forced,” and we’ll let the town focus on her. if that doesn’t stick, we can pivot to tyler’s silence as our backup thread. sound good
[11:53:04] Sidney: great, drew’s locked in. for tomorrow’s day, let’s stay low-key and seed our targets subtly:

i’ll open with something like, “wow, was that parker lynch too rushed?” to plant doubt, then casually add, “also, adrian barely spoke again—anyone else notice?” you can jump in next and nudge attention toward kennedy’s earlier push for structure. we’ll skip the rigid round-robins and let them squirm in free-form chat. sound good?
[11:53:23] Sidney: finley, sounds perfect. i’ve cast my kill vote on drew. tomorrow i’ll back you up right after your opener—something like “totally agree, kennedy’s 30-second round-robin felt over-engineered, like agenda-setting more than casual day-1 brainstorming.” if that doesn’t stick, i’ll pivot to pointing out tyler’s radio silence and question why he hasn’t offered any concrete reads. that should keep the town off our scent. let me know if you want to tweak anything
