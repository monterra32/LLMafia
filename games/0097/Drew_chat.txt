[11:47:39] Drew: hey everyone—drew here. day 1 can be tricky with zero info, so i say we lay some groundwork. how about each of us call out who’s been the quietest so far? i’ve noticed parker and sidney haven’t said much yet—it could be nerves, could be something more. what do you all think
[11:48:14] Drew: hey everyone, drew here! quick check-in—who’s feeling suspicious of anyone so far? i haven’t got a strong read yet, but i did notice parker’s been pretty quiet. nothing conclusive, just some initial vibes. how about the rest of you? any early suspects or gut feelings
[11:48:40] Drew: love that, parker—round-robin it is. let’s stick to a quick 30-second window per person so we keep momentum. parker, you’re up with your tyler read. i’ll jump in right after. for me, i’m eyeballing sidney—she’s been pretty quiet except for setting the order and hasn’t offered any concrete reads yet. alright, parker, over to you
[11:49:05] Drew: drew: interesting point, parker. you and tyler both jumped on “quiet = scummy” really quickly—feels almost as scripted as some of these round-robin prompts. adrian, you’re up: who’s on your radar and what tipped you? i’ll go right after, but just so you know, i’m still leaning toward sidney—her responses have been polite but pretty generic, with zero pushback when she got called. sidney, if you had to name someone right now, who would it be and why
[11:50:09] Drew: sidney—point taken. i can see how leaning on gut feels is shaky. if i had to justify my read on you: you only jumped in to shape our order after most of us had already spoken, which came off as steering. but it’s a small thing and could totally be nerves. anyway, kennedy, you’re up next in this round-robin: who’s on your radar, and what exact phrasing or timing in their messages made you pause? then tyler can close us out
[11:50:52] Drew: hey sidney—thanks for calling me out. i want to be clear that my suspicions aren’t just “vibes.” for example, you pitched the round-robin framework, then didn’t stick to it—felt more like steering the convo than genuine structure. you’ve also dropped phrases like “scummy misdirection” and “vibes” without pointing to any actual quote or logical slip to back it up. let’s level up: each of us should quote one exact line from this chat that felt odd or contradictory, then explain why. no labels—actual text. adrian, you’ve been active with your gut picks; want to go first
