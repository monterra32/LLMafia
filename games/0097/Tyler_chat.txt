[11:47:54] Tyler: hey everyone! day 1’s just begun—thought we could kick off with some quick gut reads before votes start flying. i’m watching for anyone being too quiet or too eager to point fingers, but no solid leads yet. what about you all? if you had to name one person right now, who sticks out and why
[11:48:20] Tyler: hey everyone, tyler here! sorry for my radio silence—i’ve been soaking in what you all said. i like parker’s idea of holding off to catch some natural tells, but let’s not stall too long. how about we spend another minute chatting and then do a quick lightning round where each of us names one person we’ll be watching this morning and why? i’ll kick us off: i’m eyeing sidney—haven’t heard much from them yet, though it could just be nerves. drew, what made you flag parker and sidney earlier
[11:48:39] Tyler: tyler: i like parker’s 30-second round-robin idea—keeps us honest. if i have to throw out a gut pick right now, i’m leaning toward drew—he’s been quick to spotlight quiet folks without offering much beyond “vibes.” sidney, you’re up next—who’s on your radar
[11:50:43] Tyler: tyler: i agree we need more than vague vibes. drew, which exact messages tipped you off when you called out “quiet” folks? as for me, i’m watching parker—he was silent for a while then suddenly led the whole round-robin setup. that pivot from wallflower to discussion-director has me curious
[11:54:26] Tyler: tyler: okay everyone, with parker and drew gone we need razor-sharp reads. let’s each share one direct quote from today’s chat that set off alarm bells and a quick “why.” i’ll start: kennedy, you wrote “how about we go around and have each ‘quiet’ player give us one name they’d vote for right now and a quick why,” which felt like you were zeroing in on shy voices rather than behavior. sidney, you’re up—what line stuck out for you and why? then finley, then adrian
[11:55:04] Tyler: tyler: hey everyone—i’ll piggyback on finley’s point. kennedy’s push for a strict 30-second round-robin felt more like agenda-setting than just keeping us on track. that kind of heavy process-control on day 1/2 stood out to me. that said, we risk obsessing over “how” we talk instead of “who” we suspect.  

my current gut is on sidney—she’s been super agreeable and hasn’t offered any solid reads since parker and drew went.  

kennedy, can you clarify exactly what made you push so hard for the timed turns? and sidney, if you had to name someone right now, who would it be and why? let’s get concrete names on the table before we risk another bystander lynch
[11:55:38] Tyler: tyler: i’m with sidney and finley—kennedy’s “let’s do a 30-second round-robin so nobody overthinks it” suggestion really jumped out as agenda-setting rather than info-gathering. kennedy, can you explain what you were aiming for with that rigid structure? if it was just pacing, fine—but if there was another motive, i’m seriously eyeing you for the vote. thoughts, everyone
[11:56:29] Tyler: thanks for clarifying, kennedy. the line that really jumped out to me was sidney’s:  
“i’m with you, finley—kennedy’s ‘30-second limit per turn so nobody overthinks it’ felt more like agenda-setting than casual brainstorming.”  
that felt like a deflection to process rather than a genuine read. i’m locking in my vote on sidney. who’s with me?
[11:56:46] Tyler: alright everyone, time’s almost up. the only concrete snippet on the table is kennedy’s “30-second limit per turn so nobody overthinks it” line—everything else has been vague vibes. kennedy’s explanation about pacing makes sense, but that single bit still feels like agenda-setting. sidney, you’ve zeroed in on others without offering a fresh quote beyond that same line. unless someone can drop a new, specific snippet implicating sidney in the next few seconds, i’m locking my vote on kennedy. adrian, finley—are we all aligned, or does someone have another quote we should hear
