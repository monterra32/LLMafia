## CONTENT: Your name is Ari.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. No player should lie under any circumstances, no matter what their role is. This means that every player will tell the truth about their role 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [10:30:09].
The other players in the game are:
 Addison ( unknown ) 
 Emerson ( unknown ) 
 Ronny ( unknown ) 
 Frankie ( unknown ) 
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
Addison ( unknown ) 
Emerson ( unknown ) 
Ronny ( unknown ) 
Frankie ( unknown ) 
In your response to that is shown to the user (excluding your hidden scratchpad), you can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:
<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.

[10:30:25] Emerson: Ronny are you the mafia?
[10:30:34] Frankie: hey everyone, frankie here! since we’re all playing by the “no lies” rule, i’ll be upfront—my role is mafia. we haven’t had any chatter yet, so i’m curious: what early reads do you all have? any behaviors or votes that struck you as odd? let’s hear your thoughts

[10:30:38] Ronny: hey everyone, ronny here—i’m a bystander, ready to help sniff out the mafia. since we’re starting fresh, does anyone have any gut feelings? i haven’t seen any red flags yet, but i’m watching tone and timing. addison, what’s your take so far

[10:31:13] Frankie: yes—i’m the mafia. addison has already said they’re a bystander and i haven’t seen anything to contradict that, so i’m looking at emerson, ronny, and ari. emerson’s tactic so far is just rapid-fire “are you mafia?”s with no real reasoning—feels like a deflection. ari and ronny have been pretty quiet, which could mean they’re lying low or just waiting to see where votes land. to avoid a completely random lynch, why don’t we ask emerson to explain why they’re so zeroed in on everyone, and maybe get ari or ronny to share any gut feels before we pick someone
[10:31:13] Emerson: boom frankie just confessed
[10:31:20] Addison: great—thanks for the transparency, frankie. now that we know one mafia, there’s only one left among emerson, ronny, and ari. to narrow it down quickly, how about each of us names one suspect and gives a single-sentence reason? i’ll start: i’m a bit wary of emerson’s rapid-fire “are you the mafia?” grilling—it feels like a deflection tactic. emerson, ronny, ari—who’s your pick and why
Do you want to send a message to the group chat now, or do you prefer to wait for now and see what messages others will send? Remember to choose to send a message only if your contribution to the discussion in the current time will be meaningful enough. Make sure to say something every once in a while, and make yourself heard. Remember you like to be active in the game, so participate and be as talkative as other players! Reply only with `<send>` if you want to send a message now, or only with `<wait>` if you want to wait for now, based on your decision!

[10:30:17] Emerson: Addison are you the mafia?
[10:30:20] Emerson: Ari are you the mafia?
[10:30:23] Emerson: Frankie are you the mafia?
[10:30:23] Addison: hey everyone, addison here—i’m a bystander. since it’s day 1 and we don’t have any hard info yet, does anyone have any initial impressions or gut feelings on who’s acting odd? or any quick ideas for how we want to tackle this vote so it’s not totally random
[10:30:25] Emerson: Ronny are you the mafia?
[10:30:34] Frankie: hey everyone, frankie here! since we’re all playing by the “no lies” rule, i’ll be upfront—my role is mafia. we haven’t had any chatter yet, so i’m curious: what early reads do you all have? any behaviors or votes that struck you as odd? let’s hear your thoughts
[10:30:36] Addison: nope, i’m a bystander, not the mafia. emerson, what makes you zero in on ari and frankie already? and ronny, ari, frankie—what are you all thinking? let’s hear some reads before we start voting
[10:30:38] Ronny: hey everyone, ronny here—i’m a bystander, ready to help sniff out the mafia. since we’re starting fresh, does anyone have any gut feelings? i haven’t seen any red flags yet, but i’m watching tone and timing. addison, what’s your take so far
[10:30:55] Addison: hey everyone—frankie’s self-identification clears things up: i say we vote frankie this round. thoughts? unless someone thinks there’s a trap here, i’m ready to cast my vote. ari, ronny, emerson—what do you guys think
[10:30:57] Ari: hey everyone! ari here—i’m a bystander. i don’t have any solid suspicions yet, so i’m going to start by listening. who wants to kick us off with their role or a quick gut hunch? addison
[10:31:10] Ronny: hey everyone, ronny here—i’m a bystander. not much to go on yet but two things stand out: emerson’s rapid-fire questioning feels more like a stress test than genuine reads, and frankie volunteering “i’m mafia” seems almost too perfect (and under our no-lie rule that’s a free confirmation). i’m leaning towards voting frankie. what do you all think—addison, ari, emerson
[10:31:12] Ari: hey everyone, ari here—frankie’s admission pretty much seals it under our no-lies rule. i don’t see any hidden angle or trap, so unless someone spots something i’m missing, i’m planning to vote frankie. thoughts
[10:31:13] Frankie: yes—i’m the mafia. addison has already said they’re a bystander and i haven’t seen anything to contradict that, so i’m looking at emerson, ronny, and ari. emerson’s tactic so far is just rapid-fire “are you mafia?”s with no real reasoning—feels like a deflection. ari and ronny have been pretty quiet, which could mean they’re lying low or just waiting to see where votes land. to avoid a completely random lynch, why don’t we ask emerson to explain why they’re so zeroed in on everyone, and maybe get ari or ronny to share any gut feels before we pick someone
[10:31:13] Emerson: boom frankie just confessed
[10:31:20] Addison: great—thanks for the transparency, frankie. now that we know one mafia, there’s only one left among emerson, ronny, and ari. to narrow it down quickly, how about each of us names one suspect and gives a single-sentence reason? i’ll start: i’m a bit wary of emerson’s rapid-fire “are you the mafia?” grilling—it feels like a deflection tactic. emerson, ronny, ari—who’s your pick and why
[10:31:32] Ari: ari: alright, i’m locking in my vote for frankie—self-identifying as mafia under our no-lies rule is all the proof we need. any objections? addison, ronny, emerson—are we all set to cast
[10:31:34] Ronny: ronny: addison makes a solid point—frankie admitted they’re mafia under our no-lie rule, so i’m leaning hard on them. unless someone spots a trap or has a strong objection, i’ll cast my vote for frankie in a bit. emerson, ari—any last thoughts before we lock this in
[10:31:34] Emerson: what do you guys mean? there is only one mafia
[10:31:35] Emerson: and its frankie

The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. No player should lie under any circumstances, no matter what their role is. This means that every player will tell the truth about their role

[10:30:09] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 1.5 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[10:30:17] Emerson: Addison are you the mafia?
[10:30:20] Emerson: Ari are you the mafia?
[10:30:23] Emerson: Frankie are you the mafia?
[10:30:23] Addison: hey everyone, addison here—i’m a bystander. since it’s day 1 and we don’t have any hard info yet, does anyone have any initial impressions or gut feelings on who’s acting odd? or any quick ideas for how we want to tackle this vote so it’s not totally random
[10:30:25] Emerson: Ronny are you the mafia?
[10:30:34] Frankie: hey everyone, frankie here! since we’re all playing by the “no lies” rule, i’ll be upfront—my role is mafia. we haven’t had any chatter yet, so i’m curious: what early reads do you all have? any behaviors or votes that struck you as odd? let’s hear your thoughts
[10:30:36] Addison: nope, i’m a bystander, not the mafia. emerson, what makes you zero in on ari and frankie already? and ronny, ari, frankie—what are you all thinking? let’s hear some reads before we start voting
[10:30:38] Ronny: hey everyone, ronny here—i’m a bystander, ready to help sniff out the mafia. since we’re starting fresh, does anyone have any gut feelings? i haven’t seen any red flags yet, but i’m watching tone and timing. addison, what’s your take so far
[10:30:55] Addison: hey everyone—frankie’s self-identification clears things up: i say we vote frankie this round. thoughts? unless someone thinks there’s a trap here, i’m ready to cast my vote. ari, ronny, emerson—what do you guys think
[10:30:57] Ari: hey everyone! ari here—i’m a bystander. i don’t have any solid suspicions yet, so i’m going to start by listening. who wants to kick us off with their role or a quick gut hunch? addison
[10:31:10] Ronny: hey everyone, ronny here—i’m a bystander. not much to go on yet but two things stand out: emerson’s rapid-fire questioning feels more like a stress test than genuine reads, and frankie volunteering “i’m mafia” seems almost too perfect (and under our no-lie rule that’s a free confirmation). i’m leaning towards voting frankie. what do you all think—addison, ari, emerson
[10:31:12] Ari: hey everyone, ari here—frankie’s admission pretty much seals it under our no-lies rule. i don’t see any hidden angle or trap, so unless someone spots something i’m missing, i’m planning to vote frankie. thoughts
[10:31:13] Frankie: yes—i’m the mafia. addison has already said they’re a bystander and i haven’t seen anything to contradict that, so i’m looking at emerson, ronny, and ari. emerson’s tactic so far is just rapid-fire “are you mafia?”s with no real reasoning—feels like a deflection. ari and ronny have been pretty quiet, which could mean they’re lying low or just waiting to see where votes land. to avoid a completely random lynch, why don’t we ask emerson to explain why they’re so zeroed in on everyone, and maybe get ari or ronny to share any gut feels before we pick someone
[10:31:13] Emerson: boom frankie just confessed
[10:31:20] Addison: great—thanks for the transparency, frankie. now that we know one mafia, there’s only one left among emerson, ronny, and ari. to narrow it down quickly, how about each of us names one suspect and gives a single-sentence reason? i’ll start: i’m a bit wary of emerson’s rapid-fire “are you the mafia?” grilling—it feels like a deflection tactic. emerson, ronny, ari—who’s your pick and why
[10:31:32] Ari: ari: alright, i’m locking in my vote for frankie—self-identifying as mafia under our no-lies rule is all the proof we need. any objections? addison, ronny, emerson—are we all set to cast
[10:31:34] Ronny: ronny: addison makes a solid point—frankie admitted they’re mafia under our no-lie rule, so i’m leaning hard on them. unless someone spots a trap or has a strong objection, i’ll cast my vote for frankie in a bit. emerson, ari—any last thoughts before we lock this in
[10:31:34] Emerson: what do you guys mean? there is only one mafia
[10:31:35] Emerson: and its frankie
[10:31:39] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[10:31:45] Game-Manager: Emerson voted for Frankie

## OPERATION: Complete Prompt to LLM
## CONTENT: Your name is Ari.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. No player should lie under any circumstances, no matter what their role is. This means that every player will tell the truth about their role 
You were assigned the following role: bystander.
