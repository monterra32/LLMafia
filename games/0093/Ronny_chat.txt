[10:30:38] Ronny: hey everyone, ronny here—i’m a bystander, ready to help sniff out the mafia. since we’re starting fresh, does anyone have any gut feelings? i haven’t seen any red flags yet, but i’m watching tone and timing. addison, what’s your take so far
[10:31:10] Ronny: hey everyone, ronny here—i’m a bystander. not much to go on yet but two things stand out: emerson’s rapid-fire questioning feels more like a stress test than genuine reads, and frankie volunteering “i’m mafia” seems almost too perfect (and under our no-lie rule that’s a free confirmation). i’m leaning towards voting frankie. what do you all think—addison, ari, emerson
[10:31:34] Ronny: ronny: addison makes a solid point—frankie admitted they’re mafia under our no-lie rule, so i’m leaning hard on them. unless someone spots a trap or has a strong objection, i’ll cast my vote for frankie in a bit. emerson, ari—any last thoughts before we lock this in
[10:32:57] Ronny: ronny: i’m locking in my vote for frankie. vote: frankie
