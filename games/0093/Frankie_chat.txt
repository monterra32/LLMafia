[10:30:34] Frankie: hey everyone, frankie here! since we’re all playing by the “no lies” rule, i’ll be upfront—my role is mafia. we haven’t had any chatter yet, so i’m curious: what early reads do you all have? any behaviors or votes that struck you as odd? let’s hear your thoughts
[10:31:13] Frankie: yes—i’m the mafia. addison has already said they’re a bystander and i haven’t seen anything to contradict that, so i’m looking at emerson, ronny, and ari. emerson’s tactic so far is just rapid-fire “are you mafia?”s with no real reasoning—feels like a deflection. ari and ronny have been pretty quiet, which could mean they’re lying low or just waiting to see where votes land. to avoid a completely random lynch, why don’t we ask emerson to explain why they’re so zeroed in on everyone, and maybe get ari or ronny to share any gut feels before we pick someone
