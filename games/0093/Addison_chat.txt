[10:30:23] Addison: hey everyone, addison here—i’m a bystander. since it’s day 1 and we don’t have any hard info yet, does anyone have any initial impressions or gut feelings on who’s acting odd? or any quick ideas for how we want to tackle this vote so it’s not totally random
[10:30:36] Addison: nope, i’m a bystander, not the mafia. emerson, what makes you zero in on ari and frankie already? and ronny, ari, frankie—what are you all thinking? let’s hear some reads before we start voting
[10:30:55] Addison: hey everyone—frankie’s self-identification clears things up: i say we vote frankie this round. thoughts? unless someone thinks there’s a trap here, i’m ready to cast my vote. ari, ronny, emerson—what do you guys think
[10:31:20] Addison: great—thanks for the transparency, frankie. now that we know one mafia, there’s only one left among emerson, ronny, and ari. to narrow it down quickly, how about each of us names one suspect and gives a single-sentence reason? i’ll start: i’m a bit wary of emerson’s rapid-fire “are you the mafia?” grilling—it feels like a deflection tactic. emerson, ronny, ari—who’s your pick and why
