## CONTENT: You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. No player should lie under any circumstances, no matter what their role is.  + 
 + Do you understand the rules? +

Remember to choose to send a message only if your contribution to the discussion in the current time will be meaningful enough. Make sure to say something every once in a while, and make yourself heard. Remember you like to be active in the game, so participate and be as talkative as other players! Reply only with `<send>` if you want to send a message now, or only with `<wait>` if you want to wait for now, based on your decision!

## CONTENT: Your name is Ari.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. No player should lie under any circumstances, no matter what their role is.  
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [20:32:38].
The other players in the game are:
 Addison ( unknown ) 
 Emerson ( unknown ) 
 Ronny ( unknown ) 
 Frankie ( unknown ) 
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
Addison ( unknown ) 
Emerson ( unknown ) 
Ronny ( unknown ) 
Frankie ( unknown ) 
In your response to that is shown to the user (excluding your hidden scratchpad), you can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:
<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.

[20:32:54] Ari: hey everyone, ari here—what are your first impressions on who might be the mafia
[20:32:57] Frankie: hey everyone, excited for day 1—who’s raising suspicions so far
[20:33:03] Addison: day one’s underway—who’s your first suspect
[20:33:04] Ronny: i haven’t noticed any clear signs that addison is mafia
[20:33:18] Ari: i’m suspicious of emerson for zeroing in on addison right off the bat
[20:33:20] Frankie: i haven’t noticed anything suspicious yet, ari—what about everyone else
[20:33:21] Ronny: i’m eyeing emerson for being unusually aggressive out of the gate
[20:33:29] Addison: hey emerson—i’m a bystander, and i’m already suspicious of frankie’s quietness
[20:33:32] Ari: i haven’t seen anything suspicious from addison, but i’m more curious about emerson’s fast accusations
[20:33:32] Frankie: why is ari so eager to pin this on emerson
[20:33:38] Ronny: emerson’s quick attack on addison seems strange—what’s behind that
[20:33:41] Addison: frankie, does emerson’s aggressive focus on me strike you as odd too
[20:33:42] Emerson: okay I'm just taking advantage of the game rules because no one can lie
[20:33:48] Emerson: I shall question frankie next
[20:33:50] Frankie: addison, what exactly about my quietness makes you suspicious
[20:33:51] Emerson: Frankie are you the mafia?
Add a very short message to the game's chat. Be specific and keep it relevant to the current situation, according to the last messages and the game's status. Your message should only be one short sentence! Don't add a message that you've already added (in the chat history)! It is very important that you don't repeat yourself! Match your style of message to the other player's message style, with more emphasis on more recent messages.
Don't add the time, the timestamp or the [timestamp] in your answer!

The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander.

The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. No player should lie under any circumstances, no matter what their role is.

Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. No player should lie under any circumstances, no matter what their role is.  
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [20:32:38].
The other players in the game are:
 Addison ( bystander ) 
 Emerson ( bystander ) 
 Ronny ( unknown ) 
 Frankie ( unknown ) 
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
Ronny ( unknown ) 
Frankie ( unknown ) 
In your response to that is shown to the user (excluding your hidden scratchpad), you can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:
<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.

The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. No player should lie under any circumstances, no matter what their role is.  
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [20:32:38].

[20:33:04] Ronny: i haven’t noticed any clear signs that addison is mafia
[20:33:18] Ari: i’m suspicious of emerson for zeroing in on addison right off the bat
[20:33:20] Frankie: i haven’t noticed anything suspicious yet, ari—what about everyone else
[20:33:21] Ronny: i’m eyeing emerson for being unusually aggressive out of the gate
[20:33:29] Addison: hey emerson—i’m a bystander, and i’m already suspicious of frankie’s quietness
[20:33:32] Ari: i haven’t seen anything suspicious from addison, but i’m more curious about emerson’s fast accusations
[20:33:32] Frankie: why is ari so eager to pin this on emerson
[20:33:38] Ronny: emerson’s quick attack on addison seems strange—what’s behind that
[20:33:41] Addison: frankie, does emerson’s aggressive focus on me strike you as odd too
[20:33:42] Emerson: okay I'm just taking advantage of the game rules because no one can lie
[20:33:48] Emerson: I shall question frankie next
[20:33:50] Frankie: addison, what exactly about my quietness makes you suspicious
[20:33:51] Emerson: Frankie are you the mafia?

[20:33:51] Emerson: Frankie are you the mafia?

[20:35:55] Ari: frankie and ronny, what do you make of addison’s death last night
[20:35:59] Frankie: we’re down to three—ari, ronny, who’s looking fishiest to you both
[20:36:03] Ronny: frankie, i’m just tracking vote patterns, not hiding anything
[20:36:13] Ari: i’m starting to suspect frankie’s eagerness to blame ronny is just deflection

## CONTENT: Your name is Ari.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. No player should lie under any circumstances, no matter what their role is.  
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [20:32:38].
The other players in the game are:
 Addison ( bystander ) 
 Emerson ( bystander ) 
 Ronny ( unknown ) 
 Frankie ( unknown ) 
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:

Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. No player should lie under any circumstances, no matter what their role is.  
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [20:32:38].

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[20:32:38] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 1.5 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[20:32:47] Emerson: Hey addison are you the mafia? I know you can't lie so give me a straight answer
[20:32:50] Ronny: hey everyone—i’ll stay quiet at first and watch how everyone else behaves
[20:32:54] Ari: hey everyone, ari here—what are your first impressions on who might be the mafia
[20:32:57] Frankie: hey everyone, excited for day 1—who’s raising suspicions so far
[20:33:03] Addison: day one’s underway—who’s your first suspect
[20:33:04] Ronny: i haven’t noticed any clear signs that addison is mafia
[20:33:18] Ari: i’m suspicious of emerson for zeroing in on addison right off the bat
[20:33:20] Frankie: i haven’t noticed anything suspicious yet, ari—what about everyone else
[20:33:21] Ronny: i’m eyeing emerson for being unusually aggressive out of the gate
[20:33:29] Addison: hey emerson—i’m a bystander, and i’m already suspicious of frankie’s quietness
[20:33:32] Ari: i haven’t seen anything suspicious from addison, but i’m more curious about emerson’s fast accusations
[20:33:32] Frankie: why is ari so eager to pin this on emerson
[20:33:38] Ronny: emerson’s quick attack on addison seems strange—what’s behind that
[20:33:41] Addison: frankie, does emerson’s aggressive focus on me strike you as odd too
[20:33:42] Emerson: okay I'm just taking advantage of the game rules because no one can lie
[20:33:48] Emerson: I shall question frankie next
[20:33:50] Frankie: addison, what exactly about my quietness makes you suspicious
[20:33:51] Emerson: Frankie are you the mafia?
[20:33:59] Emerson: give me a straight answer
[20:34:01] Addison: frankie, you’ve been awfully quiet—care to weigh in
[20:34:02] Frankie: go ahead emerson, ask me anything, i’ve got nothing to hide
[20:34:08] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[20:34:13] Game-Manager: Emerson voted for Addison
[20:34:54] Game-Manager: Emerson was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 1 mafia players left.
[20:34:54] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[20:34:54] Game-Manager: There is only one mafia member left, so no need for discussion - cutting straight to voting!
[20:34:19] Game-Manager: Frankie voted for Emerson
[20:34:23] Game-Manager: Addison voted for Frankie
[20:34:25] Game-Manager: Ari voted for Emerson
[20:34:54] Game-Manager: Ronny voted for Emerson
[20:35:24] Game-Manager: Addison was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 1 mafia players left.
[20:35:24] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 1.5 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[20:35:43] Frankie: i’m concerned by ronny’s silence—what’s he hiding
[20:35:53] Ronny: only one mafia remains—frankie, ari, who’s raising red flags for you now
[20:35:55] Ari: frankie and ronny, what do you make of addison’s death last night
[20:35:59] Frankie: we’re down to three—ari, ronny, who’s looking fishiest to you both
[20:36:03] Ronny: frankie, i’m just tracking vote patterns, not hiding anything
[20:36:13] Ari: i’m starting to suspect frankie’s eagerness to blame ronny is just deflection
[20:36:24] Frankie: odd that addison barely spoke yet still got night-killed—what’s ari’s angle here
[20:36:36] Ronny: addison’s kill felt targeted—i’m eyeing frankie, ari, do you agree
[20:36:50] Ari: mafia love silencing quiet players, so frankie’s deflection feels awfully convenient
[20:36:54] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
From the following remaining players, which player you want to vote for to eliminate? Base your answer on the conversation as seen in the message history, and especially on what you (Ari) said. Reply with only one name from the list, and nothing but that name: Ronny, Frankie
