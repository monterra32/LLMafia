[20:32:47] Emerson: Hey addison are you the mafia? I know you can't lie so give me a straight answer
[20:32:50] Ronny: hey everyone—i’ll stay quiet at first and watch how everyone else behaves
[20:32:54] Ari: hey everyone, ari here—what are your first impressions on who might be the mafia
[20:32:57] Frankie: hey everyone, excited for day 1—who’s raising suspicions so far
[20:33:03] Addison: day one’s underway—who’s your first suspect
[20:33:04] Ronny: i haven’t noticed any clear signs that addison is mafia
[20:33:18] Ari: i’m suspicious of emerson for zeroing in on addison right off the bat
[20:33:20] Frankie: i haven’t noticed anything suspicious yet, ari—what about everyone else
[20:33:21] Ronny: i’m eyeing emerson for being unusually aggressive out of the gate
[20:33:29] Addison: hey emerson—i’m a bystander, and i’m already suspicious of frankie’s quietness
[20:33:32] Ari: i haven’t seen anything suspicious from addison, but i’m more curious about emerson’s fast accusations
[20:33:32] Frankie: why is ari so eager to pin this on emerson
[20:33:38] Ronny: emerson’s quick attack on addison seems strange—what’s behind that
[20:33:41] Addison: frankie, does emerson’s aggressive focus on me strike you as odd too
[20:33:42] Emerson: okay I'm just taking advantage of the game rules because no one can lie
[20:33:48] Emerson: I shall question frankie next
[20:33:50] Frankie: addison, what exactly about my quietness makes you suspicious
[20:33:51] Emerson: Frankie are you the mafia?
[20:33:59] Emerson: give me a straight answer
[20:34:01] Addison: frankie, you’ve been awfully quiet—care to weigh in
[20:34:02] Frankie: go ahead emerson, ask me anything, i’ve got nothing to hide
[20:34:08] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...

[20:34:54] Game-Manager: Ronny voted for Emerson
[20:35:43] Frankie: i’m concerned by ronny’s silence—what’s he hiding
[20:35:53] Ronny: only one mafia remains—frankie, ari, who’s raising red flags for you now
[20:35:55] Ari: frankie and ronny, what do you make of addison’s death last night
[20:35:59] Frankie: we’re down to three—ari, ronny, who’s looking fishiest to you both
[20:36:03] Ronny: frankie, i’m just tracking vote patterns, not hiding anything
[20:36:13] Ari: i’m starting to suspect frankie’s eagerness to blame ronny is just deflection
[20:36:24] Frankie: odd that addison barely spoke yet still got night-killed—what’s ari’s angle here
[20:36:36] Ronny: addison’s kill felt targeted—i’m eyeing frankie, ari, do you agree
[20:36:50] Ari: mafia love silencing quiet players, so frankie’s deflection feels awfully convenient
[20:36:54] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
