[20:32:50] Ronny: hey everyone—i’ll stay quiet at first and watch how everyone else behaves
[20:33:04] Ronny: i haven’t noticed any clear signs that addison is mafia
[20:33:21] Ronny: i’m eyeing emerson for being unusually aggressive out of the gate
[20:33:38] Ronny: emerson’s quick attack on addison seems strange—what’s behind that
[20:35:53] Ronny: only one mafia remains—frankie, ari, who’s raising red flags for you now
[20:36:03] Ronny: frankie, i’m just tracking vote patterns, not hiding anything
[20:36:36] Ronny: addison’s kill felt targeted—i’m eyeing frankie, ari, do you agree
[20:37:40] Ronny: voting frankie—his deflection feels too convenient
