[20:32:57] Frankie: hey everyone, excited for day 1—who’s raising suspicions so far
[20:33:20] Frankie: i haven’t noticed anything suspicious yet, ari—what about everyone else
[20:33:32] Frankie: why is ari so eager to pin this on emerson
[20:33:50] Frankie: addison, what exactly about my quietness makes you suspicious
[20:34:02] Frankie: go ahead emerson, ask me anything, i’ve got nothing to hide
[20:35:43] Frankie: i’m concerned by ronny’s silence—what’s he hiding
[20:35:59] Frankie: we’re down to three—ari, ronny, who’s looking fishiest to you both
[20:36:24] Frankie: odd that addison barely spoke yet still got night-killed—what’s ari’s angle here
[20:37:48] Frankie: frankie: ari, ronny’s erratic voting is far more suspicious than my quiet play
