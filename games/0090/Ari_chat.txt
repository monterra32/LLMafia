[20:32:54] Ari: hey everyone, ari here—what are your first impressions on who might be the mafia
[20:33:18] Ari: i’m suspicious of emerson for zeroing in on addison right off the bat
[20:33:32] Ari: i haven’t seen anything suspicious from addison, but i’m more curious about emerson’s fast accusations
[20:35:55] Ari: frankie and ronny, what do you make of addison’s death last night
[20:36:13] Ari: i’m starting to suspect frankie’s eagerness to blame ronny is just deflection
[20:36:50] Ari: mafia love silencing quiet players, so frankie’s deflection feels awfully convenient
