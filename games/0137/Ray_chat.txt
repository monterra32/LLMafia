[20:39:24] Ray: hey everyone, ray here! since we’re all starting fresh, how about a quick round of suspicions? i’m not set on anyone yet, but i’m low-key wary of sam—they’ve been totally quiet so far today, which feels a bit odd. could totally be overthinking it though. who’s on your radar
[20:39:48] Ray: ray: hey everyone, ray here—really excited to get this rolling! i like dakota’s gut-check idea and parker’s quick thoughts, but for my own read i’m zeroing in on sam—he’s been oddly quiet so far, which could be caution or cover. i’d love to hear what sam’s thinking, and i’m also curious to hear kennedy’s gut. no firm call yet, just kicking things off
[20:40:10] Ray: hey sam, totally—when i said your silence felt off, i was comparing how you sat back on day 1 and again today before diving in. could be you’re sizing everyone up, could be covering something. on parker, i’m struck by the flip from being nearly silent to ping-ponging between targets (first kennedy, now sam). parker—what’s driving those shifts? and kennedy, you’ve zeroed in on sam twice now—what specific reads make them jump out? let’s get those concrete observations so we can narrow things down
[20:40:38] Ray: i’ve been thinking it over and i’m switching my vote to dakota. parker flagged their pattern back to day 1 and sam’s seconding feels like they’re ganging up on dakota. that combo strikes me as more suspicious than sam’s flip in tone. i’m voting dakota—anyone else leaning that way or got a last thought before we lock it in
[20:43:02] Ray: oops, looks like my vote got stuck on dakota by mistake—switching it to sam. sam, you’ve gone from sitting silent to leading the charge without ever quoting specifics or pointing to real patterns, which reads like deflection. kennedy, you’ve already got sam locked in too—any last reason to switch, or shall we finalize on sam
[20:43:37] Ray: ray: looks like it’s just the three of us now. i’ve been re‐reading our last messages and here’s what stands out: sam gave a concrete snippet on my shift from silence to suddenly driving the conversation—solid detective work. kennedy, you’ve leaned on gut feelings against me but haven’t cited a single quote or behavior. that gap feels more suspicious than anything i’ve done. unless someone can point to a concrete moment that proves i’m the mafia, i’m casting my vote for kennedy. sam—what do you think of that
[20:44:09] Ray: sam, here’s why i zeroed in on dakota yesterday: in her first post she said parker’s “waiting to see” felt like “fishing for a reaction” but never backed it up with a single quote or example. that vague smokescreen read like deflection. kennedy, pointing at my switch-to-dakota vote because she died that night makes no sense—i’m the only mafia, of course i voted the person i’d kill. there’s no hidden partner. in contrast, sam, you’ve been lob-ping out “feels off” and demanding specifics from us but still haven’t quoted a single line yourself. broad accusations with zero substance is the classic mafia play. i’m locking in my vote on sam
