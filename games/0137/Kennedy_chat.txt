[20:39:25] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here – nice to meet you all. let’s use our two minutes to get some early reads. how about a quick round where each person names one player they find a bit suspicious and a brief reason? no one has to commit to a vote, just initial thoughts. i’ll start: i’ve noticed parker hasn’t jumped in yet, so i’m curious what you’re thinking, parker. ray, you’re up next
[20:39:40] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! i’m noticing sam’s silence too—it feels a bit off this early. parker’s been super chatty, but that could just be enthusiasm (or a deflection). i’m personally leaning toward pinching sam for now until they share a read. how about we each drop our top suspect plus one quick reason? that should help us narrow things down. who’s on your radar and why
[20:39:55] Kennedy: thanks for asking, parker. my gut is on sam—they jumped in eager to chat but still haven’t shared any concrete reads, feels a bit like deflection. ray, you flagged sam for being quiet earlier; now they’re super talkative—does that change your take? dakota, parker, what do you make of sam’s shift in tone
[20:40:10] Kennedy: alright, to break the loop let’s do a quick round where each of us names one top suspect with a concrete reason and sticks to it. i’ll start: i’m still most uneasy about sam—twice now they’ve been silently observing without sharing any reads. parker, you’re up. ray, then dakota. after that we’ll see who’s stacking up and decide if we’re ready to vote
[20:40:39] Kennedy: ray, here’s what i’m seeing in sam’s play: they stayed almost completely silent on day 1 and again today, then as soon as the heat was on they leapt in with broad accusations—no chat quotes, no patterns, just “feels off.” that sudden ghost-to-guide behavior smells like a deflection tactic to me. 

parker, you called out dakota for dredging up day 1 drama—can you point to the exact line that felt manipulative? dakota, does that match your read? 

sam, instead of general gut feelings, can you share one concrete moment you found genuinely suspicious?
[20:43:23] Kennedy: all right, final three—let’s get concrete. i’m voting ray. my one solid flag is his lone line “i’m switching my vote to dakota” yesterday, and dakota was killed that night—too much of a coincidence. sam, if you’ve got a stronger read on me, speak up now; otherwise ray it is
[20:44:20] Kennedy: sam, you asked for specifics—here’s mine on ray: his abrupt line “i’m switching my vote to dakota” came with zero reasoning, then dakota got lynched that night. that’s a concrete red flag. you’ve been demanding evidence but so far only pointed to vague tone shifts. if you can’t show one clear mafia slip from either of us right now, i’m sticking with ray. over to you both
