[20:39:19] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here—excited to get started! since we’re all silent so far, how about a quick round of gut impressions? i’ll go first: i’m mildly eyeing parker (no solid read yet, just feels a bit “waiting to see”). what about the rest of you—who’s on your radar and why
[20:39:31] Dakota: hey everyone! tough morning after last night’s loss. i’ve been thinking back to day 1—parker was almost silent the whole time, and ray seemed really eager to pin things on kennedy. sam, what was your take on parker’s quiet approach? i’m not ready to jump on someone yet, but i’d love to hear everyone’s gut before we start voting
[20:40:18] Dakota: okay folks, quick gut check before we start voting:

parker, you were almost awol yesterday and now pivot to kennedy—what made you switch so fast?

ray, you pegged sam for being silent, but they just jumped in—does that ease your mind or do you still feel off about them?

kennedy, you’ve flagged both sam and parker—what stands out more strongly to you?

sam, when you said you were just listening, what exactly were you looking for before you spoke up?

i’m still leaning lightly toward parker for yesterday’s near-silence, but i’m totally open to shifting before we lock in a vote. thoughts?
