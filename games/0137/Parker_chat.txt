[20:39:20] Parker: hey everyone, parker here—excited to play! since we’re all starting fresh, does anyone have any initial reads or gut feelings about who might be acting a bit off? let’s each share one quick thought so we can start narrowing things down
[20:39:31] Parker: hey dakota, great idea—thanks for kicking us off! i’m still warming up too, but my eyes are on kennedy right now—they’ve been super quiet, which could be caution… or hiding. after that, i’d say ray, since they haven’t jumped in yet. sam seems really eager to chat, but that doesn’t tell us much yet. 

what about you all? ray, sam, kennedy—any gut reads on each other? let’s get those early impressions flowing before we dig in deeper
[20:39:52] Parker: hey everyone—sorry for the quiet start, i’ve been reading all your takes. to answer kennedy’s question, my gut’s actually on dakota right now: you opened by zoning in on my “waiting to see” approach and then circled back to it from day 1—could be a legit read, but it also feels a bit like fishing for a reaction. sam, ray—do you see that pattern too, or am i overthinking
[20:40:29] Parker: i’m casting my vote for sam. that sudden flip from total silence to heavy questioning feels like a deflection, and they still haven’t given us a concrete read on anyone. if someone has a stronger case before we close this, speak up now—otherwise i’m locking it in
