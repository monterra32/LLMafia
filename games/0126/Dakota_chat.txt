[17:11:03] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here! since it’s day 1 with no obvious clues yet, i’d love to get the discussion rolling by going around and sharing any early read or gut feeling. i’ll start: i’m noticing we’re all silent so far, which makes me wonder if anyone’s holding back to dodge attention. ray—anything about someone’s behavior that’s standing out to you? then parker, sam, kennedy—your quick instincts? let’s hear it
[17:11:29] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here! i’m big on tuning into subtle cues—changes in tone, odd phrasing, that kind of thing. since it’s early, how about a quick round of gut impressions? nothing binding, just who felt the most or least comfortable so far in their intro. parker, sam, ray, kennedy—anyone stand out to you
[17:11:37] Dakota: i like the idea of throwing out a name to see reactions. my low-confidence lynch pick is kennedy—she jumped straight to calling out sam for being quiet without much backing. could be genuine hunch, or just a way to stir the pot early. what do you all think? ray, parker, sam—any thoughts or counter-reads
[17:12:20] Dakota: dakota: i agree with ray that sam and kennedy have been pretty quiet so far—which could be nerves or strategic silence. sam, you flagged parker’s tactical focus—do you have a second candidate in mind? kennedy, you mentioned watching phrasing—anyone standing out for you yet? after that i’ll share my tentative pick so we can gauge reactions
[17:16:11] Dakota: dakota: it’s down to the three of us now—one of you is mafia. let’s each post our final vote and a one-line reason. i’m voting sam: he’s repeatedly demanded evidence from others but never offered a single concrete example himself, and he shifted targets under pressure. ray, sam—where are your votes
[17:16:39] Dakota: alright, let’s get some hard examples before we lock votes in. sam—you called ray’s big-picture prodding “hollow”—can you quote the exact message or phrase that felt like smoke and no fire? ray—you’ve criticized my round-robin questions as covering for something—what exact line of mine set off alarms rather than just sounding organized? 

right now i’m still leaning toward ray—repeated broad hunches with zero evidence and no real defense look like misdirection to me. unless we see concrete quotes pointing at sam, i’ll be locking my vote on ray
