[17:11:06] Ray: hey everyone! excited to get started—i love a good mystery. no real clues yet, but i’m curious how everyone plans to read the table. any first impressions or gut feelings on who might be acting a bit off? let’s hear it
[17:11:34] Ray: hey everyone, ray here! i agree it’s early, but i’m noticing sam and kennedy haven’t said much yet. could just be nerves or low-key play, but it does stand out on day 1. sam, kennedy—what are you both thinking so far? parker, dakota, does that strike you as odd too
[17:11:50] Ray: interesting points, everyone. for my quick gut: i’m tentatively eyeing parker—they’ve been all about reading hesitation but haven’t really shared any solid examples or their own thought process yet. feels a bit like deflection to me, though it could just be cautious play. sam, kennedy—do you see what i mean in parker’s wording, or am i reading too much into it
[17:12:06] Ray: ray: i’m with parker on this—kennedy’s early call feels a bit forced, like she’s steering without substance. i’d be comfortable casting a placeholder vote on her to see how she defends. sam, dakota—what do you think
[17:12:38] Ray: parker, the moment that felt off to me was when you said you were “just listening” and then immediately threw out a hunch on kennedy—without pointing to any specific phrase, pause or tone you’d actually observed. it came across as reactive, like testing our response rather than sharing a concrete read. can you recall what exactly in kennedy’s wording or timing made you zero in on her
[17:15:31] Ray: alright, heading into day 2 with just the three of us. we need to pick someone to lynch. i’m leaning toward sam—your relative silence through day 1’s debates and around parker’s lynch feels more like flying under the radar than day-one nerves. 

sam, can you point to a concrete phrase or pause in dakota’s posts that makes you rule them out as mafia? dakota, you flagged sam’s quiet—what exact moment or wording felt strategic rather than just jitters? unless i hear something solid, my vote will go to sam
[17:16:03] Ray: hey sam, dakota—i hate that we keep losing good people like parker and kennedy, but it’s down to the three of us now. we need to lock in our final vote. 

i’m still feeling uneasy about sam’s play: your silence on day 1 and day 2 felt more like strategic observation than nerves, then you jumped in only when it benefitted you. dakota, yesterday you asked everyone for concrete examples—did anything sam actually say or do stick out as oddly timed or worded? 

sam, what about dakota’s structured, round-robin questioning felt like a cover to you rather than just a methodical approach? let’s get one clear detail each way so we can cast our ballots
[17:16:49] Ray: ray: sam, you asked for something fishy in dakota’s play—recall on day 1 when we were hashing out kennedy, i pressed dakota for a specific phrase or tone that felt off, and they completely dodged it, instead flipping the question back to me. that’s classic deflection—grilling others but never committing a read of their own. dakota, if you really think my style is “vague,” point to one post where i asked a question without backing it up with a read. you’ve been quick to question both of us but slow to stake a claim yourself. sam, if you want concrete evidence over gut feeling, you’ll see dakota’s the real suspect here. i’m voting to lynch dakota
