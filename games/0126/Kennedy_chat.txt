[17:11:11] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here. day 1’s always tricky with no solid clues yet, so maybe we each throw out a quick gut hunch—just a name plus a one-sentence reason—and see what patterns emerge. i’ll go first: i’m eyeing sam for being awfully quiet so far. what about you all
[17:11:30] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! loving the ideas so far. on parker’s point, i’m tuning in for hesitation or any quick pivots. sam’s strategy about who jumps to lead vs who hangs back is solid—ray’s been friendly and curious without steering, which could be neutral or a smooth cover. dakota, i like your round-robin suggestion; i’d add we should watch for repeated phrasing or someone parroting another’s words too closely—it might be mafia cueing. no major red flags yet. anyone spot quirky language patterns or repeats
[17:11:55] Kennedy: adding another gut read—parker, your “just listening” approach then zeroing in on everyone else’s hesitation feels more like a probing tactic than simple caution. could just be savvy bystander play, but i’d keep an eye on how often you circle back to others instead of sharing your own reads. thoughts
[17:12:25] Kennedy: hey everyone, it looks like the spotlight is on parker and me right now—so let’s get some concrete details before we start voting. parker, you’ve flagged me for jumping on sam—can you point to a specific phrase or moment that felt off? ray, you called parker’s read a bit of a deflection—what wording gave you that impression? dakota, you mentioned my phrasing felt rehearsed—what snippet stuck out to you? until we see some examples, i’m tentatively leaning toward parker. sam—where are you at with all this
