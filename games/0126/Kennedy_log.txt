## CONTENT: You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  + 
 + Do you understand the rules? +

[17:11:08] Sam: hey everyone! sam here—excited to get started. it’s day 1 so we’re all flying blind, but i’m thinking our best move is to watch who jumps into leading the convo versus who stays totally quiet. any gut feelings yet? who should we keep our eyes on first

Do you want to send a message to the group chat now, or do you prefer to wait for now and see what messages others will send? Remember to choose to send a message only if your contribution to the discussion in the current time will be meaningful enough. Make sure to say something every once in a while, and make yourself heard. Remember you like to be active in the game, so participate and be as talkative as other players! Reply only with `<send>` if you want to send a message now, or only with `<wait>` if you want to wait for now, based on your decision!

## CONTENT: Your name is Kennedy.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [17:10:48].
The other players in the game are:
 Ray ( unknown ) 
 Parker ( unknown ) 
 Sam ( unknown ) 
 Dakota ( unknown ) 
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
Ray ( unknown ) 
Parker ( unknown )

In your response to that is shown to the user (excluding your hidden scratchpad), you can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:
<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[17:10:48] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:10:59] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! looking forward to playing with you all. i tend to watch how folks react during votes—hesitation can be telling. what about you? any early strategy you’re considering
[17:11:03] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here! since it’s day 1 with no obvious clues yet, i’d love to get the discussion rolling by going around and sharing any early read or gut feeling. i’ll start: i’m noticing we’re all silent so far, which makes me wonder if anyone’s holding back to dodge attention. ray—anything about someone’s behavior that’s standing out to you? then parker, sam, kennedy—your quick instincts? let’s hear it
[17:11:06] Ray: hey everyone! excited to get started—i love a good mystery. no real clues yet, but i’m curious how everyone plans to read the table. any first impressions or gut feelings on who might be acting a bit off? let’s hear it
[17:11:08] Sam: hey everyone! sam here—excited to get started. it’s day 1 so we’re all flying blind, but i’m thinking our best move is to watch who jumps into leading the convo versus who stays totally quiet. any gut feelings yet? who should we keep our eyes on first
[17:11:11] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here. day 1’s always tricky with no solid clues yet, so maybe we each throw out a quick gut hunch—just a name plus a one-sentence reason—and see what patterns emerge. i’ll go first: i’m eyeing sam for being awfully quiet so far. what about you all
[17:11:12] Parker: hey everyone—parker here! day 1’s always a bit quiet, so i’ll hang back and listen for now. but i’d love to hear everyone’s quick gut feels: do you have any early hunch on who might be acting off? sam, ray, kennedy, dakota—anyone want to share what you’re thinking before we start voting
[17:11:27] Sam: hey everyone! sam here. parker, i like your note on hesitation—definitely something to watch. dakota, thanks for kicking things off. i don’t have a rock-solid gut yet, though parker’s tactical focus stands out—could be a sharp bystander or clever misdirection. ray, your broad questions are great ice-breakers. for now i’m mostly sizing up how folks explain their reads. maybe we each throw out one tentative lynch candidate—just to see how the table reacts
[17:11:29] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here! i’m big on tuning into subtle cues—changes in tone, odd phrasing, that kind of thing. since it’s early, how about a quick round of gut impressions? nothing binding, just who felt the most or least comfortable so far in their intro. parker, sam, ray, kennedy—anyone stand out to you
[17:11:30] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! loving the ideas so far. on parker’s point, i’m tuning in for hesitation or any quick pivots. sam’s strategy about who jumps to lead vs who hangs back is solid—ray’s been friendly and curious without steering, which could be neutral or a smooth cover. dakota, i like your round-robin suggestion; i’d add we should watch for repeated phrasing or someone parroting another’s words too closely—it might be mafia cueing. no major red flags yet. anyone spot quirky language patterns or repeats
[17:11:34] Ray: hey everyone, ray here! i agree it’s early, but i’m noticing sam and kennedy haven’t said much yet. could just be nerves or low-key play, but it does stand out on day 1. sam, kennedy—what are you both thinking so far? parker, dakota, does that strike you as odd too
[17:11:37] Dakota: i like the idea of throwing out a name to see reactions. my low-confidence lynch pick is kennedy—she jumped straight to calling out sam for being quiet without much backing. could be genuine hunch, or just a way to stir the pot early. what do you all think? ray, parker, sam—any thoughts or counter-reads
[17:11:42] Parker: i’ll throw in my gut hunch: i’m eyeing kennedy for being the first to call out sam with almost no reads—it feels like she might be steering the convo. ray, sam, dakota—do you get the same sense
[17:11:50] Ray: interesting points, everyone. for my quick gut: i’m tentatively eyeing parker—they’ve been all about reading hesitation but haven’t really shared any solid examples or their own thought process yet. feels a bit like deflection to me, though it could just be cautious play. sam, kennedy—do you see what i mean in parker’s wording, or am i reading too much into it
Do you want to send a message to the group chat now, or do you prefer to wait for now and see what messages others will send? Remember to choose to send a message only if your contribution to the discussion in the current time will be meaningful enough. Make sure to say something every once in a while, and make yourself heard. Remember you like to be active in the game, so participate and be as talkative as other players! Reply only with `<send>` if you want to send a message now, or only with `<wait>` if you want to wait for now, based on your decision!

The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  
You were assigned the following role: bystander.

## CONTENT: Your name is Kennedy.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [17:10:48].
The other players in the game are:
 Ray ( unknown ) 
 Parker ( unknown ) 
 Sam ( unknown ) 
 Dakota ( unknown ) 
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:

In your response to that is shown to the user (excluding your hidden scratchpad), you can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:
<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[17:10:48] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:10:59] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! looking forward to playing with you all. i tend to watch how folks react during votes—hesitation can be telling. what about you? any early strategy you’re considering
[17:11:03] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here! since it’s day 1 with no obvious clues yet, i’d love to get the discussion rolling by going around and sharing any early read or gut feeling. i’ll start: i’m noticing we’re all silent so far, which makes me wonder if anyone’s holding back to dodge attention. ray—anything about someone’s behavior that’s standing out to you? then parker, sam, kennedy—your quick instincts? let’s hear it
[17:11:06] Ray: hey everyone! excited to get started—i love a good mystery. no real clues yet, but i’m curious how everyone plans to read the table. any first impressions or gut feelings on who might be acting a bit off? let’s hear it
[17:11:08] Sam: hey everyone! sam here—excited to get started. it’s day 1 so we’re all flying blind, but i’m thinking our best move is to watch who jumps into leading the convo versus who stays totally quiet. any gut feelings yet? who should we keep our eyes on first
[17:11:11] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here. day 1’s always tricky with no solid clues yet, so maybe we each throw out a quick gut hunch—just a name plus a one-sentence reason—and see what patterns emerge. i’ll go first: i’m eyeing sam for being awfully quiet so far. what about you all
[17:11:12] Parker: hey everyone—parker here! day 1’s always a bit quiet, so i’ll hang back and listen for now. but i’d love to hear everyone’s quick gut feels: do you have any early hunch on who might be acting off? sam, ray, kennedy, dakota—anyone want to share what you’re thinking before we start voting
[17:11:27] Sam: hey everyone! sam here. parker, i like your note on hesitation—definitely something to watch. dakota, thanks for kicking things off. i don’t have a rock-solid gut yet, though parker’s tactical focus stands out—could be a sharp bystander or clever misdirection. ray, your broad questions are great ice-breakers. for now i’m mostly sizing up how folks explain their reads. maybe we each throw out one tentative lynch candidate—just to see how the table reacts
[17:11:29] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here! i’m big on tuning into subtle cues—changes in tone, odd phrasing, that kind of thing. since it’s early, how about a quick round of gut impressions? nothing binding, just who felt the most or least comfortable so far in their intro. parker, sam, ray, kennedy—anyone stand out to you
[17:11:30] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! loving the ideas so far. on parker’s point, i’m tuning in for hesitation or any quick pivots. sam’s strategy about who jumps to lead vs who hangs back is solid—ray’s been friendly and curious without steering, which could be neutral or a smooth cover. dakota, i like your round-robin suggestion; i’d add we should watch for repeated phrasing or someone parroting another’s words too closely—it might be mafia cueing. no major red flags yet. anyone spot quirky language patterns or repeats
[17:11:34] Ray: hey everyone, ray here! i agree it’s early, but i’m noticing sam and kennedy haven’t said much yet. could just be nerves or low-key play, but it does stand out on day 1. sam, kennedy—what are you both thinking so far? parker, dakota, does that strike you as odd too
[17:11:37] Dakota: i like the idea of throwing out a name to see reactions. my low-confidence lynch pick is kennedy—she jumped straight to calling out sam for being quiet without much backing. could be genuine hunch, or just a way to stir the pot early. what do you all think? ray, parker, sam—any thoughts or counter-reads
[17:11:42] Parker: i’ll throw in my gut hunch: i’m eyeing kennedy for being the first to call out sam with almost no reads—it feels like she might be steering the convo. ray, sam, dakota—do you get the same sense
[17:11:50] Ray: interesting points, everyone. for my quick gut: i’m tentatively eyeing parker—they’ve been all about reading hesitation but haven’t really shared any solid examples or their own thought process yet. feels a bit like deflection to me, though it could just be cautious play. sam, kennedy—do you see what i mean in parker’s wording, or am i reading too much into it
[17:11:55] Kennedy: adding another gut read—parker, your “just listening” approach then zeroing in on everyone else’s hesitation feels more like a probing tactic than simple caution. could just be savvy bystander play, but i’d keep an eye on how often you circle back to others instead of sharing your own reads. thoughts
[17:11:58] Sam: hey everyone, here’s my quick hunch—i’m kinda watching dakota. they jumped in first with structured prompts, almost like they wanted to see each reaction. could just be eagerness, but could also be a way to control things. parker, does that match what you saw? kennedy, you called out my quiet start—fair point, i like absorbing info early, but what about my silence struck you as off
[17:12:04] Parker: i’m not ready to pull the trigger on kennedy yet—let’s get some specifics on these hunches first.  

dakota, you said kennedy is “stirring the pot” too early—what exact phrasing or tone felt off to you?  
kennedy, you flagged sam’s quiet—what about sam’s intro or wording stood out as suspicious rather than just day 1 nerves?  
ray’s also eyeballing both of them for low talk—ray, can you point to a moment that felt coached or out of character?  

and sam, you’ve been quiet—how do you feel about being under the microscope?  

once we’ve got concrete examples instead of just vibes, i’ll be much more comfortable locking in a vote
[17:12:06] Ray: ray: i’m with parker on this—kennedy’s early call feels a bit forced, like she’s steering without substance. i’d be comfortable casting a placeholder vote on her to see how she defends. sam, dakota—what do you think
[17:12:20] Dakota: dakota: i agree with ray that sam and kennedy have been pretty quiet so far—which could be nerves or strategic silence. sam, you flagged parker’s tactical focus—do you have a second candidate in mind? kennedy, you mentioned watching phrasing—anyone standing out for you yet? after that i’ll share my tentative pick so we can gauge reactions
[17:12:25] Parker: hey everyone—interesting points all around. i’m still tilting toward kennedy for jumping straight to calling out sam with almost no backup, but i want to dig into these other reads before locking in.

sam, you flagged dakota’s structured prompts as a control play—can you point to an exact line or moment where that felt off? dakota, you kicked us into this round-robin gut-hunch exercise—what were you hoping to expose, and did you notice anything concrete in our replies?

ray, you’ve noted i’ve been deflecting—could you highlight a specific phrase of mine that felt like evasion so i can clarify my thought process?

let’s get those specifics on the table, then decide if we stay on kennedy or shift toward dakota
Do you want to send a message to the group chat now, or do you prefer to wait for now and see what messages others will send?

[17:11:29] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here! i’m big on tuning into subtle cues—changes in tone, odd phrasing, that kind of thing. since it’s early, how about a quick round of gut impressions? nothing binding, just who felt the most or least comfortable so far in their intro. parker, sam, ray, kennedy—anyone stand out to you
[17:11:30] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! loving the ideas so far. on parker’s point, i’m tuning in for hesitation or any quick pivots. sam’s strategy about who jumps to lead vs who hangs back is solid—ray’s been friendly and curious without steering, which could be neutral or a smooth cover. dakota, i like your round-robin suggestion; i’d add we should watch for repeated phrasing or someone parroting another’s words too closely—it might be mafia cueing. no major red flags yet. anyone spot quirky language patterns or repeats
[17:11:34] Ray: hey everyone, ray here! i agree it’s early, but i’m noticing sam and kennedy haven’t said much yet. could just be nerves or low-key play, but it does stand out on day 1. sam, kennedy—what are you both thinking so far? parker, dakota, does that strike you as odd too
[17:11:37] Dakota: i like the idea of throwing out a name to see reactions. my low-confidence lynch pick is kennedy—she jumped straight to calling out sam for being quiet without much backing. could be genuine hunch, or just a way to stir the pot early. what do you all think? ray, parker, sam—any thoughts or counter-reads
[17:11:42] Parker: i’ll throw in my gut hunch: i’m eyeing kennedy for being the first to call out sam with almost no reads—it feels like she might be steering the convo. ray, sam, dakota—do you get the same sense
[17:11:50] Ray: interesting points, everyone. for my quick gut: i’m tentatively eyeing parker—they’ve been all about reading hesitation but haven’t really shared any solid examples or their own thought process yet. feels a bit like deflection to me, though it could just be cautious play. sam, kennedy—do you see what i mean in parker’s wording, or am i reading too much into it
[17:11:55] Kennedy: adding another gut read—parker, your “just listening” approach then zeroing in on everyone else’s hesitation feels more like a probing tactic than simple caution. could just be savvy bystander play, but i’d keep an eye on how often you circle back to others instead of sharing your own reads. thoughts
[17:11:58] Sam: hey everyone, here’s my quick hunch—i’m kinda watching dakota. they jumped in first with structured prompts, almost like they wanted to see each reaction. could just be eagerness, but could also be a way to control things. parker, does that match what you saw? kennedy, you called out my quiet start—fair point, i like absorbing info early, but what about my silence struck you as off
[17:12:04] Parker: i’m not ready to pull the trigger on kennedy yet—let’s get some specifics on these hunches first.  

dakota, you said kennedy is “stirring the pot” too early—what exact phrasing or tone felt off to you?  
kennedy, you flagged sam’s quiet—what about sam’s intro or wording stood out as suspicious rather than just day 1 nerves?  
ray’s also eyeballing both of them for low talk—ray, can you point to a moment that felt coached or out of character?  

and sam, you’ve been quiet—how do you feel about being under the microscope?  

once we’ve got concrete examples instead of just vibes, i’ll be much more comfortable locking in a vote
[17:12:06] Ray: ray: i’m with parker on this—kennedy’s early call feels a bit forced, like she’s steering without substance. i’d be comfortable casting a placeholder vote on her to see how she defends. sam, dakota—what do you think
[17:12:20] Dakota: dakota: i agree with ray that sam and kennedy have been pretty quiet so far—which could be nerves or strategic silence. sam, you flagged parker’s tactical focus—do you have a second candidate in mind? kennedy, you mentioned watching phrasing—anyone standing out for you yet? after that i’ll share my tentative pick so we can gauge reactions
[17:12:25] Parker: hey everyone—interesting points all around. i’m still tilting toward kennedy for jumping straight to calling out sam with almost no backup, but i want to dig into these other reads before locking in.

sam, you flagged dakota’s structured prompts as a control play—can you point to an exact line or moment where that felt off? dakota, you kicked us into this round-robin gut-hunch exercise—what were you hoping to expose, and did you notice anything concrete in our replies?

ray, you’ve noted i’ve been deflecting—could you highlight a specific phrase of mine that felt like evasion so i can clarify my thought process?

let’s get those specifics on the table, then decide if we stay on kennedy or shift toward dakota

## CONTENT: Hey Parker—happy to dig in. You wanted specifics, so here’s what stood out to me:

• Parker: In your very first post you said “I’ll hang back and listen for now,” then immediately zeroed in on everyone else’s hesitation without offering any concrete reads yourself. Which exact phrase from Ray or Dakota’s intros felt off enough for you to pivot away from your own silence?  

• Sam: You called Dakota’s “structured prompts” a control play. Can you point to the exact line (for example, Dakota’s “i’ll start: i’m noticing we’re all silent…” or another reply) that struck you as manipulative rather than enthusiastic facilitation?  

• Dakota: You kicked us into this round-robin of gut hunches—what specific pattern or parroting in our replies were you hoping to uncover? Which of our answers raised a genuine red flag for you?  

• Ray: You said my early call on Sam felt like “forced steering.” Was it my “i’m eyeing Sam for being awfully quiet so far” line, or something in how I suggested watching for repeated phrasing that came off as setup rather than genuine observation?  

Once we pin down these exact phrases, we’ll all have a clearer idea whether my initial push is overzealous bystander play or if someone else really is dodging specifics.

[17:10:48] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:10:59] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! looking forward to playing with you all. i tend to watch how folks react during votes—hesitation can be telling. what about you? any early strategy you’re considering
[17:11:03] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here! since it’s day 1 with no obvious clues yet, i’d love to get the discussion rolling by going around and sharing any early read or gut feeling. i’ll start: i’m noticing we’re all silent so far, which makes me wonder if anyone’s holding back to dodge attention. ray—anything about someone’s behavior that’s standing out to you? then parker, sam, kennedy—your quick instincts? let’s hear it
[17:11:06] Ray: hey everyone! excited to get started—i love a good mystery. no real clues yet, but i’m curious how everyone plans to read the table. any first impressions or gut feelings on who might be acting a bit off? let’s hear it
[17:11:08] Sam: hey everyone! sam here—excited to get started. it’s day 1 so we’re all flying blind, but i’m thinking our best move is to watch who jumps into leading the convo versus who stays totally quiet. any gut feelings yet? who should we keep our eyes on first
[17:11:11] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here. day 1’s always tricky with no solid clues yet, so maybe we each throw out a quick gut hunch—just a name plus a one-sentence reason—and see what patterns emerge. i’ll go first: i’m eyeing sam for being awfully quiet so far. what about you all
[17:11:12] Parker: hey everyone—parker here! day 1’s always a bit quiet, so i’ll hang back and listen for now. but i’d love to hear everyone’s quick gut feels: do you have any early hunch on who might be acting off? sam, ray, kennedy, dakota—anyone want to share what you’re thinking before we start voting

[17:12:25] Kennedy: hey everyone, it looks like the spotlight is on parker and me right now—so let’s get some concrete details before we start voting. parker, you’ve flagged me for jumping on sam—can you point to a specific phrase or moment that felt off? ray, you called parker’s read a bit of a deflection—what wording gave you that impression? dakota, you mentioned my phrasing felt rehearsed—what snippet stuck out to you? until we see some examples, i’m tentatively leaning toward parker. sam—where are you at with all this
[17:12:31] Sam: alright everyone, my tentative pick is parker—lots of talk about spotting hesitation but no concrete examples so far, almost feels like steering the convo instead of sharing real reads. i’m not super confident in that read yet though. ray, dakota, do you get the same sense? parker, can you point to any actual hesitations you’ve noticed so far
[17:12:38] Ray: parker, the moment that felt off to me was when you said you were “just listening” and then immediately threw out a hunch on kennedy—without pointing to any specific phrase, pause or tone you’d actually observed. it came across as reactive, like testing our response rather than sharing a concrete read. can you recall what exactly in kennedy’s wording or timing made you zero in on her
[17:12:48] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
From the following remaining players, which player you want to vote for to lynch? Base your answer on the conversation as seen in the message history, and especially on what you (Kennedy) said. Think through your choice carefully, as it will affect the game outcome. Reply with only one name from the list, and nothing but that name: Ray, Parker, Sam, Dakota

The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.

[17:12:25] Kennedy: hey everyone, it looks like the spotlight is on parker and me right now—so let’s get some concrete details before we start voting. parker, you’ve flagged me for jumping on sam—can you point to a specific phrase or moment that felt off? ray, you called parker’s read a bit of a deflection—what wording gave you that impression? dakota, you mentioned my phrasing felt rehearsed—what snippet stuck out to you? until we see some examples, i’m tentatively leaning toward parker. sam—where are you at with all this
[17:12:31] Sam: alright everyone, my tentative pick is parker—lots of talk about spotting hesitation but no concrete examples so far, almost feels like steering the convo instead of sharing real reads. i’m not super confident in that read yet though. ray, dakota, do you get the same sense? parker, can you point to any actual hesitations you’ve noticed so far
[17:12:38] Ray: parker, the moment that felt off to me was when you said you were “just listening” and then immediately threw out a hunch on kennedy—without pointing to any specific phrase, pause or tone you’d actually observed. it came across as reactive, like testing our response rather than sharing a concrete read. can you recall what exactly in kennedy’s wording or timing made you zero in on her
[17:12:48] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
