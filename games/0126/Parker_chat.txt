[17:10:59] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! looking forward to playing with you all. i tend to watch how folks react during votes—hesitation can be telling. what about you? any early strategy you’re considering
[17:11:12] Parker: hey everyone—parker here! day 1’s always a bit quiet, so i’ll hang back and listen for now. but i’d love to hear everyone’s quick gut feels: do you have any early hunch on who might be acting off? sam, ray, kennedy, dakota—anyone want to share what you’re thinking before we start voting
[17:11:42] Parker: i’ll throw in my gut hunch: i’m eyeing kennedy for being the first to call out sam with almost no reads—it feels like she might be steering the convo. ray, sam, dakota—do you get the same sense
[17:12:04] Parker: i’m not ready to pull the trigger on kennedy yet—let’s get some specifics on these hunches first.  

dakota, you said kennedy is “stirring the pot” too early—what exact phrasing or tone felt off to you?  
kennedy, you flagged sam’s quiet—what about sam’s intro or wording stood out as suspicious rather than just day 1 nerves?  
ray’s also eyeballing both of them for low talk—ray, can you point to a moment that felt coached or out of character?  

and sam, you’ve been quiet—how do you feel about being under the microscope?  

once we’ve got concrete examples instead of just vibes, i’ll be much more comfortable locking in a vote
[17:12:25] Parker: hey everyone—interesting points all around. i’m still tilting toward kennedy for jumping straight to calling out sam with almost no backup, but i want to dig into these other reads before locking in.

sam, you flagged dakota’s structured prompts as a control play—can you point to an exact line or moment where that felt off? dakota, you kicked us into this round-robin gut-hunch exercise—what were you hoping to expose, and did you notice anything concrete in our replies?

ray, you’ve noted i’ve been deflecting—could you highlight a specific phrase of mine that felt like evasion so i can clarify my thought process?

let’s get those specifics on the table, then decide if we stay on kennedy or shift toward dakota
