[11:13:27] Ray: good luck everyone, let's work together to find the mafia
[11:13:28] Sam: hey everyone, sam here—any suspects yet
[11:13:29] Kennedy: morning everyone—let’s start talking and see who the mafia could be
[11:13:30] Parker: hi everyone, any early suspicions on who might be the mafia
[11:13:34] Dakota: hey everyone, any early suspicions on who the mafia might be
[11:13:37] Ray: morning all, who seems most suspicious so far
[11:13:39] Parker: i’m parker—dakota, any gut feelings on who’s suspicious
[11:13:40] Sam: i’ll be watching everyone’s reactions for anything suspicious
[11:13:41] Kennedy: kennedy here—anyone else think parker’s been awfully quiet so far
[11:13:44] Dakota: morning everyone—have you noticed kennedy’s been a bit quieter than ray and sam so far
[11:13:50] Kennedy: sam, you’re watching reactions—anything stand out yet
[11:13:58] Dakota: parker, why so quiet this morning
[11:14:04] Parker: kennedy, i’ve already chimed in twice—what makes you say i’ve been quiet
[11:14:06] Ray: why did dakota jump on kennedy’s point so fast
[11:14:07] Sam: sam here—dakota’s repeated digs at kennedy feel like deflection
[11:14:15] Dakota: parker, you’ve been pretty quiet since kennedy’s comment—what do you think
[11:14:17] Sam: dakota, what made you jump on kennedy so fast
[11:14:25] Parker: sorry, gathering thoughts—kennedy's quietness feels off, any thoughts
[11:14:26] Ray: counting messages won’t find the mafia—what inconsistency stood out to you
[11:14:34] Dakota: dakota: i’m not deflecting—quiet players just catch my eye
[11:14:40] Sam: parker, do you think dakota’s constant focus on kennedy is genuine or just a distraction
[11:14:42] Parker: dakota, can you point to actual suspicious behavior from kennedy
[11:14:48] Ray: parker, what exactly seems off about kennedy’s silence
[11:14:49] Kennedy: parker, who do you suspect right now
[11:15:02] Sam: ray, what about dakota's explanation seemed inconsistent
[11:15:04] Kennedy: dakota’s rushing to pin this on me—what concrete evidence is there against me
[11:15:05] Parker: i think it’s a distraction—dakota’s given no reasons to suspect kennedy
[11:15:06] Ray: kennedy accused parker without offering any proof, which seems odd
[11:15:08] Dakota: kennedy flagged parker’s silence but gave no example, which feels unsubstantiated
[11:15:18] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...

[11:16:39] Sam: sam: kennedy, since parker and dakota were innocent, who do you suspect now
[11:17:03] Kennedy: sam, who are you voting for today
[11:17:15] Ray: sam, what's your evidence for voting kennedy out
[11:17:22] Sam: only three left and one mafia—ray, who's your pick and why
[11:17:23] Kennedy: kennedy: ray’s lone vote on me when parker and dakota were innocent makes him my prime suspect
[11:17:45] Kennedy: i’m voting sam because he’s been deflecting without any evidence
[11:17:54] Ray: sam, kennedy, time to decide—who are you voting for
[11:17:59] Sam: sam: i’m voting kennedy since he accused parker without proof and then dodged my follow-ups
[11:18:16] Ray: ray: kennedy, why switch your vote to sam without any new evidence
[11:18:20] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
