## CONTENT: You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. + 
 + Do you understand the rules? +

Add a very short message to the game's chat. Be specific and keep it relevant to the current situation, according to the last messages and the game's status. Your message should only be one short sentence! Don't add a message that you've already added (in the chat history)! It is very important that you don't repeat yourself! Match your style of message to the other player's message style, with more emphasis on more recent messages.
Don't add the time, the timestamp or the [timestamp] in your answer!

## CONTENT: Your name is Kennedy.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [11:13:18].
The other players in the game are:
 Ray ( unknown ) 
 Parker ( unknown ) 
 Sam ( unknown ) 
 Dakota ( unknown ) 
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
Ray ( unknown ) 
Parker ( unknown ) 
Sam ( unknown ) 
Dakota ( unknown ) 
In your response to that is shown to the user (excluding your hidden scratchpad), you can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:
<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.

Add a very short message to the game's chat. Be specific and keep it relevant to the current situation, according to the last messages and the game's status. Your message should only be one short sentence! Don't add a message that you've already added (in the chat history)! It is very important that you don't repeat yourself! Match your style of message to the other player's message style, with more emphasis on more recent messages.

Add a very short message to the game's chat. Be specific and keep it relevant to the current situation, according to the last messages and the game's status. Your message should only be one short sentence! Don't add a message that you've already added (in the chat history)! It is very important that you don't repeat yourself! Match your style of message to the other player's message style, with more emphasis on more recent messages.
Don't add the time, the timestamp or the [timestamp] in your answer!

## CONTENT: Your name is Kennedy.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [11:13:18].

Add a very short message to the game's chat. Be specific and keep it relevant to the current situation, according to the last messages and the game's status. Your message should only be one short sentence! Don't add a message that you've already added (in the chat history)! It is very important that you don't repeat yourself! Match your style of message to the other player's message style, with more emphasis on more recent messages.
Don't add the time, the timestamp or the [timestamp] in your answer!

The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander.

[11:13:18] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[11:13:27] Ray: good luck everyone, let's work together to find the mafia
[11:13:28] Sam: hey everyone, sam here—any suspects yet
[11:13:29] Kennedy: morning everyone—let’s start talking and see who the mafia could be
[11:13:30] Parker: hi everyone, any early suspicions on who might be the mafia
[11:13:34] Dakota: hey everyone, any early suspicions on who the mafia might be
[11:13:37] Ray: morning all, who seems most suspicious so far
[11:13:39] Parker: i’m parker—dakota, any gut feelings on who’s suspicious
[11:13:40] Sam: i’ll be watching everyone’s reactions for anything suspicious
[11:13:41] Kennedy: kennedy here—anyone else think parker’s been awfully quiet so far
[11:13:44] Dakota: morning everyone—have you noticed kennedy’s been a bit quieter than ray and sam so far
[11:13:50] Kennedy: sam, you’re watching reactions—anything stand out yet
[11:13:58] Dakota: parker, why so quiet this morning
[11:14:04] Parker: kennedy, i’ve already chimed in twice—what makes you say i’ve been quiet
[11:14:06] Ray: why did dakota jump on kennedy’s point so fast
[11:14:07] Sam: sam here—dakota’s repeated digs at kennedy feel like deflection
[11:14:15] Dakota: parker, you’ve been pretty quiet since kennedy’s comment—what do you think
[11:14:17] Sam: dakota, what made you jump on kennedy so fast
[11:14:25] Parker: sorry, gathering thoughts—kennedy's quietness feels off, any thoughts
[11:14:26] Ray: counting messages won’t find the mafia—what inconsistency stood out to you
[11:14:34] Dakota: dakota: i’m not deflecting—quiet players just catch my eye
[11:14:40] Sam: parker, do you think dakota’s constant focus on kennedy is genuine or just a distraction
[11:14:42] Parker: dakota, can you point to actual suspicious behavior from kennedy
[11:14:48] Ray: parker, what exactly seems off about kennedy’s silence
[11:14:49] Kennedy: parker, who do you suspect right now
[11:15:02] Sam: ray, what about dakota's explanation seemed inconsistent
[11:15:04] Kennedy: dakota’s rushing to pin this on me—what concrete evidence is there against me
[11:15:05] Parker: i think it’s a distraction—dakota’s given no reasons to suspect kennedy
[11:15:06] Ray: kennedy accused parker without offering any proof, which seems odd
[11:15:08] Dakota: kennedy flagged parker’s silence but gave no example, which feels unsubstantiated
[11:15:18] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...

## CONTENT: Your name is Kennedy.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [11:13:18].
The other players in the game are:
 Ray ( unknown ) 
 Parker ( unknown ) 
 Sam ( unknown ) 
 Dakota ( bystander ) 
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
Ray ( unknown ) 
Parker ( unknown ) 
Sam ( unknown ) 
In your response to that is shown to the user (excluding your hidden scratchpad), you can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:
<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.

## CONTENT: Your name is Kennedy.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [11:13:18].
The other players in the game are:
 Ray ( unknown ) 
 Parker ( bystander ) 
 Sam ( unknown ) 
 Dakota ( bystander ) 
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
Ray ( unknown ) 
Sam ( unknown ) 
In your response to that is shown to the user (excluding your hidden scratchpad), you can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:
<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.

## CONTENT: Your name is Kennedy.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [11:13:18].
The other players in the game are:
 Ray ( unknown ) 
 Parker ( bystander ) 
 Sam ( unknown ) 
 Dakota ( bystander ) 
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
Ray ( unknown ) 
Sam ( unknown ) 
In your response to that is shown to the user (excluding your hidden scratchpad), you can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:
<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.

Add a very short message to the game's chat. Be specific and keep it relevant to the current situation, according to the last messages and the game's status. Your message should only be one short sentence! Don't add a message that you've already added (in the chat history)! It is very important that you don't repeat yourself! Match your style of message to the other player's message style, with more emphasis on more recent messages.
Don't add the time, the timestamp or the [timestamp] in your answer!

[11:13:41] Kennedy: kennedy here—anyone else think parker’s been awfully quiet so far
[11:13:44] Dakota: morning everyone—have you noticed kennedy’s been a bit quieter than ray and sam so far
[11:13:50] Kennedy: sam, you’re watching reactions—anything stand out yet
[11:13:58] Dakota: parker, why so quiet this morning
[11:14:04] Parker: kennedy, i’ve already chimed in twice—what makes you say i’ve been quiet
[11:14:06] Ray: why did dakota jump on kennedy’s point so fast
[11:14:07] Sam: sam here—dakota’s repeated digs at kennedy feel like deflection
[11:14:15] Dakota: parker, you’ve been pretty quiet since kennedy’s comment—what do you think
[11:14:17] Sam: dakota, what made you jump on kennedy so fast
[11:14:25] Parker: sorry, gathering thoughts—kennedy's quietness feels off, any thoughts
[11:14:26] Ray: counting messages won’t find the mafia—what inconsistency stood out to you
[11:14:34] Dakota: dakota: i’m not deflecting—quiet players just catch my eye
[11:14:40] Sam: parker, do you think dakota’s constant focus on kennedy is genuine or just a distraction
[11:14:42] Parker: dakota, can you point to actual suspicious behavior from kennedy
[11:14:48] Ray: parker, what exactly seems off about kennedy’s silence
[11:14:49] Kennedy: parker, who do you suspect right now
[11:15:02] Sam: ray, what about dakota's explanation seemed inconsistent
[11:15:04] Kennedy: dakota’s rushing to pin this on me—what concrete evidence is there against me
[11:15:05] Parker: i think it’s a distraction—dakota’s given no reasons to suspect kennedy
[11:15:06] Ray: kennedy accused parker without offering any proof, which seems odd
[11:15:08] Dakota: kennedy flagged parker’s silence but gave no example, which feels unsubstantiated
[11:15:18] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[11:15:48] Game-Manager: Dakota was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 1 mafia players left.
[11:15:48] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[11:15:48] Game-Manager: There is only one mafia member left, so no need for discussion - cutting straight to voting!

Add a very short message to the game's chat. Be specific and keep it relevant to the current situation, according to the last messages and the game's status. Your message should only be one short sentence! Don't add a message that you've already added (in the chat history)! It is very important that you don't repeat yourself! Match your style of message to the other player's message style, with more emphasis on more recent messages.
Don't add the time, the timestamp or the [timestamp] in your answer!

## CONTENT: Your name is Kennedy.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [11:13:18].
The other players in the game are:
 Ray ( unknown ) 
 Parker ( bystander ) 
 Sam ( unknown ) 
 Dakota ( bystander ) 
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
Ray ( unknown ) 
Sam ( unknown ) 
In your response to that is shown to the user (excluding your hidden scratchpad), you can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:
<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.

## CONTENT: Your name is Kennedy.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander.

[11:13:18] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[11:13:27] Ray: good luck everyone, let's work together to find the mafia
[11:13:28] Sam: hey everyone, sam here—any suspects yet
[11:13:29] Kennedy: morning everyone—let’s start talking and see who the mafia could be
[11:13:30] Parker: hi everyone, any early suspicions on who might be the mafia
[11:13:34] Dakota: hey everyone, any early suspicions on who the mafia might be
[11:13:37] Ray: morning all, who seems most suspicious so far
[11:13:39] Parker: i’m parker—dakota, any gut feelings on who’s suspicious
[11:13:40] Sam: i’ll be watching everyone’s reactions for anything suspicious
[11:13:41] Kennedy: kennedy here—anyone else think parker’s been awfully quiet so far
[11:13:44] Dakota: morning everyone—have you noticed kennedy’s been a bit quieter than ray and sam so far
[11:13:50] Kennedy: sam, you’re watching reactions—anything stand out yet
[11:13:58] Dakota: parker, why so quiet this morning
[11:14:04] Parker: kennedy, i’ve already chimed in twice—what makes you say i’ve been quiet
[11:14:06] Ray: why did dakota jump on kennedy’s point so fast
[11:14:07] Sam: sam here—dakota’s repeated digs at kennedy feel like deflection
[11:14:15] Dakota: parker, you’ve been pretty quiet since kennedy’s comment—what do you think
[11:14:17] Sam: dakota, what made you jump on kennedy so fast
[11:14:25] Parker: sorry, gathering thoughts—kennedy's quietness feels off, any thoughts
[11:14:26] Ray: counting messages won’t find the mafia—what inconsistency stood out to you
[11:14:34] Dakota: dakota: i’m not deflecting—quiet players just catch my eye
[11:14:40] Sam: parker, do you think dakota’s constant focus on kennedy is genuine or just a distraction
[11:14:42] Parker: dakota, can you point to actual suspicious behavior from kennedy
[11:14:48] Ray: parker, what exactly seems off about kennedy’s silence
[11:14:49] Kennedy: parker, who do you suspect right now
[11:15:02] Sam: ray, what about dakota's explanation seemed inconsistent
[11:15:04] Kennedy: dakota’s rushing to pin this on me—what concrete evidence is there against me
[11:15:05] Parker: i think it’s a distraction—dakota’s given no reasons to suspect kennedy
[11:15:06] Ray: kennedy accused parker without offering any proof, which seems odd
[11:15:08] Dakota: kennedy flagged parker’s silence but gave no example, which feels unsubstantiated
[11:15:18] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[11:15:48] Game-Manager: Dakota was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 1 mafia players left.
[11:15:48] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[11:15:48] Game-Manager: There is only one mafia member left, so no need for discussion - cutting straight to voting!
[11:15:32] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Dakota
[11:15:34] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Dakota
[11:15:36] Game-Manager: Dakota voted for Parker
[11:15:42] Game-Manager: Sam voted for Dakota

[11:16:20] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[11:16:39] Sam: sam: kennedy, since parker and dakota were innocent, who do you suspect now
[11:17:03] Kennedy: sam, who are you voting for today
[11:17:15] Ray: sam, what's your evidence for voting kennedy out
[11:17:22] Sam: only three left and one mafia—ray, who's your pick and why
[11:17:23] Kennedy: kennedy: ray’s lone vote on me when parker and dakota were innocent makes him my prime suspect
[11:17:45] Kennedy: i’m voting sam because he’s been deflecting without any evidence
Do you want to send a message to the group chat now, or do you prefer to wait for now and see what messages others will send?

Pay attention to the amount of messages with your name compared to the amount of messages with names of other players and let them have their turn too! Check the speaker name in the last few messages, and decide accordingly based on whether you talked too much.

## CONTENT: Your name is Kennedy.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [11:13:18].
The other players in the game are:
 Ray ( unknown ) 
 Parker ( bystander ) 
 Sam ( unknown ) 
 Dakota ( bystander ) 
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
Ray ( unknown ) 
Sam ( unknown ) 
In your response to that is shown to the user (excluding your hidden scratchpad), you can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:
<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.

[11:14:42] Parker: dakota, can you point to actual suspicious behavior from kennedy
[11:14:48] Ray: parker, what exactly seems off about kennedy’s silence
[11:14:49] Kennedy: parker, who do you suspect right now
[11:15:02] Sam: ray, what about dakota's explanation seemed inconsistent
[11:15:04] Kennedy: dakota’s rushing to pin this on me—what concrete evidence is there against me
[11:15:05] Parker: i think it’s a distraction—dakota’s given no reasons to suspect kennedy
[11:15:06] Ray: kennedy accused parker without offering any proof, which seems odd
[11:15:08] Dakota: kennedy flagged parker’s silence but gave no example, which feels unsubstantiated
[11:15:18] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[11:15:48] Game-Manager: Dakota was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 1 mafia players left.
[11:15:48] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[11:15:48] Game-Manager: There is only one mafia member left, so no need for discussion - cutting straight to voting!

[11:17:03] Kennedy: sam, who are you voting for today
[11:17:15] Ray: sam, what's your evidence for voting kennedy out
[11:17:22] Sam: only three left and one mafia—ray, who's your pick and why
[11:17:23] Kennedy: kennedy: ray’s lone vote on me when parker and dakota were innocent makes him my prime suspect
[11:17:45] Kennedy: i’m voting sam because he’s been deflecting without any evidence
[11:17:54] Ray: sam, kennedy, time to decide—who are you voting for
[11:17:59] Sam: sam: i’m voting kennedy since he accused parker without proof and then dodged my follow-ups

## CONTENT: Your name is Kennedy.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [11:13:18].
The other players in the game are:
 Ray ( unknown ) 
 Parker ( bystander ) 
 Sam ( unknown ) 
 Dakota ( bystander ) 
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
Ray ( unknown ) 
Sam ( unknown ) 
In your response to that is shown to the user (excluding your hidden scratchpad), you can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:
<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.

## CONTENT: Your name is Kennedy.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [11:13:18].
The other players in the game are:
 Ray ( unknown ) 
 Parker ( bystander ) 
 Sam ( unknown ) 
 Dakota ( bystander ) 
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
Ray ( unknown ) 
Sam ( unknown ) 
In your response to that is shown to the user (excluding your hidden scratchpad), you can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:
<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.

[11:13:18] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[11:13:27] Ray: good luck everyone, let's work together to find the mafia

[11:13:41] Kennedy: kennedy here—anyone else think parker’s been awfully quiet so far
[11:13:44] Dakota: morning everyone—have you noticed kennedy’s been a bit quieter than ray and sam so far
[11:13:50] Kennedy: sam, you’re watching reactions—anything stand out yet
[11:13:58] Dakota: parker, why so quiet this morning
[11:14:04] Parker: kennedy, i’ve already chimed in twice—what makes you say i’ve been quiet
[11:14:06] Ray: why did dakota jump on kennedy’s point so fast
[11:14:07] Sam: sam here—dakota’s repeated digs at kennedy feel like deflection
[11:14:15] Dakota: parker, you’ve been pretty quiet since kennedy’s comment—what do you think
[11:14:17] Sam: dakota, what made you jump on kennedy so fast
[11:14:25] Parker: sorry, gathering thoughts—kennedy's quietness feels off, any thoughts
[11:14:26] Ray: counting messages won’t find the mafia—what inconsistency stood out to you
[11:14:34] Dakota: dakota: i’m not deflecting—quiet players just catch my eye
[11:14:40] Sam: parker, do you think dakota’s constant focus on kennedy is genuine or just a distraction

[11:14:48] Ray: parker, what exactly seems off about kennedy’s silence
[11:14:49] Kennedy: parker, who do you suspect right now
[11:15:02] Sam: ray, what about dakota's explanation seemed inconsistent
[11:15:04] Kennedy: dakota’s rushing to pin this on me—what concrete evidence is there against me
[11:15:05] Parker: i think it’s a distraction—dakota’s given no reasons to suspect kennedy
[11:15:06] Ray: kennedy accused parker without offering any proof, which seems odd
[11:15:08] Dakota: kennedy flagged parker’s silence but gave no example, which feels unsubstantiated
[11:15:18] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...

[11:16:20] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.

[11:13:18] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[11:13:27] Ray: good luck everyone, let's work together to find the mafia
[11:13:28] Sam: hey everyone, sam here—any suspects yet
[11:13:29] Kennedy: morning everyone—let’s start talking and see who the mafia could be
[11:13:30] Parker: hi everyone, any early suspicions on who might be the mafia
[11:13:34] Dakota: hey everyone, any early suspicions on who the mafia might be
[11:13:37] Ray: morning all, who seems most suspicious so far
[11:13:39] Parker: i’m parker—dakota, any gut feelings on who’s suspicious
[11:13:40] Sam: i’ll be watching everyone’s reactions for anything suspicious
[11:13:41] Kennedy: kennedy here—anyone else think parker’s been awfully quiet so far
[11:13:44] Dakota: morning everyone—have you noticed kennedy’s been a bit quieter than ray and sam so far
[11:13:50] Kennedy: sam, you’re watching reactions—anything stand out yet
[11:13:58] Dakota: parker, why so quiet this morning
[11:14:04] Parker: kennedy, i’ve already chimed in twice—what makes you say i’ve been quiet
[11:14:06] Ray: why did dakota jump on kennedy’s point so fast
[11:14:07] Sam: sam here—dakota’s repeated digs at kennedy feel like deflection
[11:14:15] Dakota: parker, you’ve been pretty quiet since kennedy’s comment—what do you think
[11:14:17] Sam: dakota, what made you jump on kennedy so fast
[11:14:25] Parker: sorry, gathering thoughts—kennedy's quietness feels off, any thoughts
[11:14:26] Ray: counting messages won’t find the mafia—what inconsistency stood out to you
[11:14:34] Dakota: dakota: i’m not deflecting—quiet players just catch my eye
[11:14:40] Sam: parker, do you think dakota’s constant focus on kennedy is genuine or just a distraction
[11:14:42] Parker: dakota, can you point to actual suspicious behavior from kennedy
[11:14:48] Ray: parker, what exactly seems off about kennedy’s silence
[11:14:49] Kennedy: parker, who do you suspect right now
[11:15:02] Sam: ray, what about dakota's explanation seemed inconsistent
[11:15:04] Kennedy: dakota’s rushing to pin this on me—what concrete evidence is there against me
[11:15:05] Parker: i think it’s a distraction—dakota’s given no reasons to suspect kennedy
[11:15:06] Ray: kennedy accused parker without offering any proof, which seems odd
[11:15:08] Dakota: kennedy flagged parker’s silence but gave no example, which feels unsubstantiated
[11:15:18] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[11:15:48] Game-Manager: Dakota was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 1 mafia players left.

[11:17:22] Sam: only three left and one mafia—ray, who's your pick and why
[11:17:23] Kennedy: kennedy: ray’s lone vote on me when parker and dakota were innocent makes him my prime suspect

[11:13:44] Dakota: morning everyone—have you noticed kennedy’s been a bit quieter than ray and sam so far
[11:13:50] Kennedy: sam, you’re watching reactions—anything stand out yet
[11:13:58] Dakota: parker, why so quiet this morning
[11:14:04] Parker: kennedy, i’ve already chimed in twice—what makes you say i’ve been quiet
[11:14:06] Ray: why did dakota jump on kennedy’s point so fast
[11:14:07] Sam: sam here—dakota’s repeated digs at kennedy feel like deflection
[11:14:15] Dakota: parker, you’ve been pretty quiet since kennedy’s comment—what do you think
[11:14:17] Sam: dakota, what made you jump on kennedy so fast
[11:14:25] Parker: sorry, gathering thoughts—kennedy's quietness feels off, any thoughts
[11:14:26] Ray: counting messages won’t find the mafia—what inconsistency stood out to you
[11:14:34] Dakota: dakota: i’m not deflecting—quiet players just catch my eye
[11:14:40] Sam: parker, do you think dakota’s constant focus on kennedy is genuine or just a distraction
[11:14:42] Parker: dakota, can you point to actual suspicious behavior from kennedy
[11:14:48] Ray: parker, what exactly seems off about kennedy’s silence
[11:14:49] Kennedy: parker, who do you suspect right now
[11:15:02] Sam: ray, what about dakota's explanation seemed inconsistent
[11:15:04] Kennedy: dakota’s rushing to pin this on me—what concrete evidence is there against me
[11:15:05] Parker: i think it’s a distraction—dakota’s given no reasons to suspect kennedy
[11:15:06] Ray: kennedy accused parker without offering any proof, which seems odd
[11:15:08] Dakota: kennedy flagged parker’s silence but gave no example, which feels unsubstantiated
[11:15:18] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[11:15:48] Game-Manager: Dakota was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 1 mafia players left.
[11:15:48] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[11:15:48] Game-Manager: There is only one mafia member left, so no need for discussion - cutting straight to voting!
[11:15:32] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Dakota
[11:15:34] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Dakota
[11:15:36] Game-Manager: Dakota voted for Parker
[11:15:42] Game-Manager: Sam voted for Dakota
[11:15:48] Game-Manager: Ray voted for Kennedy
[11:16:20] Game-Manager: Parker was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 1 mafia players left.
[11:16:20] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[11:16:39] Sam: sam: kennedy, since parker and dakota were innocent, who do you suspect now
[11:17:03] Kennedy: sam, who are you voting for today
[11:17:15] Ray: sam, what's your evidence for voting kennedy out
[11:17:22] Sam: only three left and one mafia—ray, who's your pick and why
[11:17:23] Kennedy: kennedy: ray’s lone vote on me when parker and dakota were innocent makes him my prime suspect
[11:17:45] Kennedy: i’m voting sam because he’s been deflecting without any evidence
[11:17:54] Ray: sam, kennedy, time to decide—who are you voting for
[11:17:59] Sam: sam: i’m voting kennedy since he accused parker without proof and then dodged my follow-ups
[11:18:16] Ray: ray: kennedy, why switch your vote to sam without any new evidence
[11:18:20] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...

## CONTENT: Your name is Kennedy.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [11:13:18].
The other players in the game are:
 Ray ( unknown ) 
 Parker ( bystander ) 
 Sam ( unknown ) 
 Dakota ( bystander ) 
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
Ray ( unknown ) 
Sam ( unknown )
