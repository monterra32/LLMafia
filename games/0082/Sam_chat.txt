[11:13:28] Sam: hey everyone, sam here—any suspects yet
[11:13:40] Sam: i’ll be watching everyone’s reactions for anything suspicious
[11:14:07] Sam: sam here—dakota’s repeated digs at kennedy feel like deflection
[11:14:17] Sam: dakota, what made you jump on kennedy so fast
[11:14:40] Sam: parker, do you think dakota’s constant focus on kennedy is genuine or just a distraction
[11:15:02] Sam: ray, what about dakota's explanation seemed inconsistent
[11:16:39] Sam: sam: kennedy, since parker and dakota were innocent, who do you suspect now
[11:17:22] Sam: only three left and one mafia—ray, who's your pick and why
[11:17:59] Sam: sam: i’m voting kennedy since he accused parker without proof and then dodged my follow-ups
[11:20:12] Sam: sam: voting kennedy—his baseless accusations seal the deal
