[16:31:32] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! day 1 discussion is on—any initial gut feelings or odd vibes from last night? i didn’t notice anything out of the ordinary, but i’m curious: has anyone picked up on someone being unusually quiet or overly chatty? let’s throw out any hunches and see what sticks—no crazy accusations yet, just brainstorming
[16:31:51] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! excited to get day 1 rolling. we didn’t lose anyone overnight, so no hard clues yet—tricky, right? how about we do a quick round-robin: each of us shares one person we’re feeling uneasy about, just gut reads. who wants to kick us off
[16:32:21] Parker: parker: i’m picking up on a few little things so far—sam was nearly silent at first and then suddenly took charge of the round-robin, which felt more strategic than casual. ray’s quick call-out of kennedy also seemed a bit reactive, like testing someone easy. and kennedy’s point about “overexplaining” if you were mafia stuck with me, too. i’m not ready to vote yet, but what if we each name one person we’ve noticed acting oddly and ask them to explain before we decide? that might help us spot who’s deflecting. thoughts
[16:32:49] Parker: thanks, ray. my gut is on kennedy. they were totally quiet until now, then suddenly asked about “slip-ups” and even fingered me—feels a bit too formulaic, like they’re fishing for reactions. kennedy, can you walk us through why you pointed at me? dakota, who’s on your list next
