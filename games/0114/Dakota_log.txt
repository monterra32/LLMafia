## CONTENT: You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  + 
 + Do you understand the rules? +

Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.

Pay attention to the amount of messages with your name compared to the amount of messages with names of other players and let them have their turn too!

[16:31:32] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! day 1 discussion is on—any initial gut feelings or odd vibes from last night? i didn’t notice anything out of the ordinary, but i’m curious: has anyone picked up on someone being unusually quiet or overly chatty? let’s throw out any hunches and see what sticks—no crazy accusations yet, just brainstorming
[16:31:36] Dakota: hey everyone, excited to get started! since it’s day 1 with no info yet, i’d rather we chat a bit before rushing to vote. let’s share any first impressions or gut feelings—who seems unusually quiet or overly eager to pick someone off the bat? what’s everyone thinking so far
[16:31:37] Ray: hey everyone, ray here! day 1 can be tough with zero clues. i’ve noticed kennedy’s been awfully quiet so far—could be hiding something, or just playing it safe. what do you all think? sam, parker, dakota—any gut feelings on who seems off? let’s get some thoughts flowing before we split our votes
[16:31:41] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! day 1 can be tricky – if i were mafia i’d probably give it away by talking way too much and overexplaining myself. how about you all? ray, parker, sam, dakota: what slip-up or behavior do you think would accidentally out you as mafia? let’s hear your thoughts
[16:31:42] Sam: hey everyone! since it’s day 1 and we’ve got 2 minutes on the clock, let’s get the convo rolling with a quick round-robin: each of us shares any tiny gut-hunch or observation—even if it feels flimsy. ray, want to kick us off? then parker, kennedy, dakota, and i’ll wrap up
[16:31:48] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here! i agree it’s early, but i did notice sam was pretty quiet at first and then jumped in with a bunch of ideas all at once—felt almost like they were trying to steer the convo. kennedy’s also been super low-key so far, and ray hasn’t said much either. parker, what did you make of that? and does anyone have a take on how we want to keep this rolling—maybe share one small thing that stood out to you so far? let’s see if any patterns emerge before we start throwing votes around
[16:31:51] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! excited to get day 1 rolling. we didn’t lose anyone overnight, so no hard clues yet—tricky, right? how about we do a quick round-robin: each of us shares one person we’re feeling uneasy about, just gut reads. who wants to kick us off
[16:31:52] Ray: ray: hey everyone, ray here! i’m all for taking it slow on day 1, but i did notice sam and kennedy haven’t jumped in yet—could be just sizing things up, but it also raises an eyebrow. sam, kennedy, what are your initial gut feels? and to the rest: anyone else noticing someone being a bit too quiet... or maybe a tad over-eager with ideas? let’s get all our first hunches out there before we lock in any votes
[16:32:04] Sam: i’ll throw out my hunch: ray’s lightning-quick read on kennedy’s “quietness” after just one line struck me as a classic deflection move—could be innocent, but it made me pause. not saying ray’s mafia, just flagging that style. 

parker, dakota—both of you asked great meta-questions but haven’t named anyone yet. how about we each share one tentative suspect (even if it’s just a vibe)? that way we can watch reactions and see if anyone doubles down or backtracks
Do you want to send a message to the group chat now, or do you prefer to wait for now and see what messages others will send? Remember to choose to send a message only if your contribution to the discussion in the current time will be meaningful enough. Don't overflow the discussion with your messages! Pay attention to the amount of messages with your name compared to the amount of messages with names of other players and let them have their turn too! Check the speaker name in the last few messages, and decide accordingly based on whether you talked too much. Reply only with `<send>` if you want to send a message now, or only with `<wait>` if you want to wait for now, based on your decision!

## CONTENT: Your name is Dakota.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  
You were assigned the following role: bystander.

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[16:31:19] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[16:31:32] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! day 1 discussion is on—any initial gut feelings or odd vibes from last night? i didn’t notice anything out of the ordinary, but i’m curious: has anyone picked up on someone being unusually quiet or overly chatty? let’s throw out any hunches and see what sticks—no crazy accusations yet, just brainstorming
[16:31:36] Dakota: hey everyone, excited to get started! since it’s day 1 with no info yet, i’d rather we chat a bit before rushing to vote. let’s share any first impressions or gut feelings—who seems unusually quiet or overly eager to pick someone off the bat? what’s everyone thinking so far
[16:31:37] Ray: hey everyone, ray here! day 1 can be tough with zero clues. i’ve noticed kennedy’s been awfully quiet so far—could be hiding something, or just playing it safe. what do you all think? sam, parker, dakota—any gut feelings on who seems off? let’s get some thoughts flowing before we split our votes
[16:31:41] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! day 1 can be tricky – if i were mafia i’d probably give it away by talking way too much and overexplaining myself. how about you all? ray, parker, sam, dakota: what slip-up or behavior do you think would accidentally out you as mafia? let’s hear your thoughts
[16:31:42] Sam: hey everyone! since it’s day 1 and we’ve got 2 minutes on the clock, let’s get the convo rolling with a quick round-robin: each of us shares any tiny gut-hunch or observation—even if it feels flimsy. ray, want to kick us off? then parker, kennedy, dakota, and i’ll wrap up
[16:31:48] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here! i agree it’s early, but i did notice sam was pretty quiet at first and then jumped in with a bunch of ideas all at once—felt almost like they were trying to steer the convo. kennedy’s also been super low-key so far, and ray hasn’t said much either. parker, what did you make of that? and does anyone have a take on how we want to keep this rolling—maybe share one small thing that stood out to you so far? let’s see if any patterns emerge before we start throwing votes around
[16:31:51] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! excited to get day 1 rolling. we didn’t lose anyone overnight, so no hard clues yet—tricky, right? how about we do a quick round-robin: each of us shares one person we’re feeling uneasy about, just gut reads. who wants to kick us off
[16:31:52] Ray: ray: hey everyone, ray here! i’m all for taking it slow on day 1, but i did notice sam and kennedy haven’t jumped in yet—could be just sizing things up, but it also raises an eyebrow. sam, kennedy, what are your initial gut feels? and to the rest: anyone else noticing someone being a bit too quiet... or maybe a tad over-eager with ideas? let’s get all our first hunches out there before we lock in any votes
[16:32:04] Sam: i’ll throw out my hunch: ray’s lightning-quick read on kennedy’s “quietness” after just one line struck me as a classic deflection move—could be innocent, but it made me pause. not saying ray’s mafia, just flagging that style.

[16:31:19] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[16:31:32] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! day 1 discussion is on—any initial gut feelings or odd vibes from last night? i didn’t notice anything out of the ordinary, but i’m curious: has anyone picked up on someone being unusually quiet or overly chatty? let’s throw out any hunches and see what sticks—no crazy accusations yet, just brainstorming
[16:31:36] Dakota: hey everyone, excited to get started! since it’s day 1 with no info yet, i’d rather we chat a bit before rushing to vote. let’s share any first impressions or gut feelings—who seems unusually quiet or overly eager to pick someone off the bat? what’s everyone thinking so far
[16:31:37] Ray: hey everyone, ray here! day 1 can be tough with zero clues. i’ve noticed kennedy’s been awfully quiet so far—could be hiding something, or just playing it safe. what do you all think? sam, parker, dakota—any gut feelings on who seems off? let’s get some thoughts flowing before we split our votes
[16:31:41] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! day 1 can be tricky – if i were mafia i’d probably give it away by talking way too much and overexplaining myself. how about you all? ray, parker, sam, dakota: what slip-up or behavior do you think would accidentally out you as mafia? let’s hear your thoughts
[16:31:42] Sam: hey everyone! since it’s day 1 and we’ve got 2 minutes on the clock, let’s get the convo rolling with a quick round-robin: each of us shares any tiny gut-hunch or observation—even if it feels flimsy. ray, want to kick us off? then parker, kennedy, dakota, and i’ll wrap up
[16:31:48] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here! i agree it’s early, but i did notice sam was pretty quiet at first and then jumped in with a bunch of ideas all at once—felt almost like they were trying to steer the convo. kennedy’s also been super low-key so far, and ray hasn’t said much either. parker, what did you make of that? and does anyone have a take on how we want to keep this rolling—maybe share one small thing that stood out to you so far? let’s see if any patterns emerge before we start throwing votes around
[16:31:51] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! excited to get day 1 rolling. we didn’t lose anyone overnight, so no hard clues yet—tricky, right? how about we do a quick round-robin: each of us shares one person we’re feeling uneasy about, just gut reads. who wants to kick us off
[16:31:52] Ray: ray: hey everyone, ray here! i’m all for taking it slow on day 1, but i did notice sam and kennedy haven’t jumped in yet—could be just sizing things up, but it also raises an eyebrow. sam, kennedy, what are your initial gut feels? and to the rest: anyone else noticing someone being a bit too quiet... or maybe a tad over-eager with ideas? let’s get all our first hunches out there before we lock in any votes
[16:32:04] Sam: i’ll throw out my hunch: ray’s lightning-quick read on kennedy’s “quietness” after just one line struck me as a classic deflection move—could be innocent, but it made me pause. not saying ray’s mafia, just flagging that style. 

parker, dakota—both of you asked great meta-questions but haven’t named anyone yet. how about we each share one tentative suspect (even if it’s just a vibe)? that way we can watch reactions and see if anyone doubles down or backtracks

## CONTENT: Your name is Dakota.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  
You were assigned the following role: bystander.

[16:32:26] Dakota: okay, i’ll toss my tentative hunch on parker—they’ve been really eager to set up the discussion format but haven’t actually pointed at anyone, which feels a bit too safe. not 100% sold, just where i’m leaning. sam, ray, kennedy—who’s your gut telling you right now
[16:32:33] Sam: alright, i’ll jump in with my gut-hunch: i’m most uneasy about kennedy – radio silence on day 1 can be a tactic. kennedy, what’s your take on that? parker, you haven’t given your pick yet—who are you uneasy about

## CONTENT: Your name is Dakota.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [16:31:19].
The other players in the game are:
 Ray ( unknown ) 
 Parker ( unknown ) 
 Sam ( unknown ) 
 Kennedy ( unknown ) 
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
Ray ( unknown ) 
Parker ( unknown ) 
Sam ( unknown ) 
Kennedy ( unknown ) 
In your response to that is shown to the user (excluding your hidden scratchpad), you can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:
<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[16:31:19] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[16:31:32] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! day 1 discussion is on—any initial gut feelings or odd vibes from last night? i didn’t notice anything out of the ordinary, but i’m curious: has anyone picked up on someone being unusually quiet or overly chatty? let’s throw out any hunches and see what sticks—no crazy accusations yet, just brainstorming
[16:31:36] Dakota: hey everyone, excited to get started! since it’s day 1 with no info yet, i’d rather we chat a bit before rushing to vote. let’s share any first impressions or gut feelings—who seems unusually quiet or overly eager to pick someone off the bat? what’s everyone thinking so far
[16:31:37] Ray: hey everyone, ray here! day 1 can be tough with zero clues. i’ve noticed kennedy’s been awfully quiet so far—could be hiding something, or just playing it safe. what do you all think? sam, parker, dakota—any gut feelings on who seems off? let’s get some thoughts flowing before we split our votes
[16:31:41] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! day 1 can be tricky – if i were mafia i’d probably give it away by talking way too much and overexplaining myself. how about you all? ray, parker, sam, dakota: what slip-up or behavior do you think would accidentally out you as mafia? let’s hear your thoughts
[16:31:42] Sam: hey everyone! since it’s day 1 and we’ve got 2 minutes on the clock, let’s get the convo rolling with a quick round-robin: each of us shares any tiny gut-hunch or observation—even if it feels flimsy. ray, want to kick us off? then parker, kennedy, dakota, and i’ll wrap up
[16:31:48] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here! i agree it’s early, but i did notice sam was pretty quiet at first and then jumped in with a bunch of ideas all at once—felt almost like they were trying to steer the convo. kennedy’s also been super low-key so far, and ray hasn’t said much either. parker, what did you make of that? and does anyone have a take on how we want to keep this rolling—maybe share one small thing that stood out to you so far? let’s see if any patterns emerge before we start throwing votes around
[16:31:51] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! excited to get day 1 rolling. we didn’t lose anyone overnight, so no hard clues yet—tricky, right? how about we do a quick round-robin: each of us shares one person we’re feeling uneasy about, just gut reads. who wants to kick us off
[16:31:52] Ray: ray: hey everyone, ray here! i’m all for taking it slow on day 1, but i did notice sam and kennedy haven’t jumped in yet—could be just sizing things up, but it also raises an eyebrow. sam, kennedy, what are your initial gut feels? and to the rest: anyone else noticing someone being a bit too quiet... or maybe a tad over-eager with ideas? let’s get all our first hunches out there before we lock in any votes
[16:32:04] Sam: i’ll throw out my hunch: ray’s lightning-quick read on kennedy’s “quietness” after just one line struck me as a classic deflection move—could be innocent, but it made me pause. not saying ray’s mafia, just flagging that style. 

parker, dakota—both of you asked great meta-questions but haven’t named anyone yet. how about we each share one tentative suspect (even if it’s just a vibe)? that way we can watch reactions and see if anyone doubles down or backtracks
[16:32:11] Ray: i’ll kick us off: i’m uneasy about sam—felt like they were pretty quiet at first and then suddenly jumped in with that round-robin plan, almost like they’re trying to steer the convo. parker, you’re up next—who’s your gut on? then kennedy, then dakota, and sam you can wrap us up
[16:32:20] Kennedy: hey all, sorry for being quiet earlier—i was jotting down thoughts. my hunch is on parker: they kicked off process talk but didn’t share any specifics, feels kinda formulaic. ray, you called me out—do you think parker’s playing it too structured? dakota, sam, let’s do a quick gut check: name one person who feels off so far, then we can see if any names repeat
[16:32:21] Parker: parker: i’m picking up on a few little things so far—sam was nearly silent at first and then suddenly took charge of the round-robin, which felt more strategic than casual. ray’s quick call-out of kennedy also seemed a bit reactive, like testing someone easy. and kennedy’s point about “overexplaining” if you were mafia stuck with me, too. i’m not ready to vote yet, but what if we each name one person we’ve noticed acting oddly and ask them to explain before we decide? that might help us spot who’s deflecting. thoughts
[16:32:26] Dakota: okay, i’ll toss my tentative hunch on parker—they’ve been really eager to set up the discussion format but haven’t actually pointed at anyone, which feels a bit too safe. not 100% sold, just where i’m leaning. sam, ray, kennedy—who’s your gut telling you right now
[16:32:33] Sam: alright, i’ll jump in with my gut-hunch: i’m most uneasy about kennedy – radio silence on day 1 can be a tactic. kennedy, what’s your take on that? parker, you haven’t given your pick yet—who are you uneasy about
[16:32:41] Dakota: i’m on board with this approach. my gut is on sam—seemed pretty quiet at first and then jumped in hard with the round-robin plan, almost like steering our process. sam, can you walk us through what prompted you to lead us that way so quickly, and why that felt natural
[16:32:49] Parker: thanks, ray. my gut is on kennedy. they were totally quiet until now, then suddenly asked about “slip-ups” and even fingered me—feels a bit too formulaic, like they’re fishing for reactions. kennedy, can you walk us through why you pointed at me? dakota, who’s on your list next

[16:32:21] Parker: parker: i’m picking up on a few little things so far—sam was nearly silent at first and then suddenly took charge of the round-robin, which felt more strategic than casual. ray’s quick call-out of kennedy also seemed a bit reactive, like testing someone easy. and kennedy’s point about “overexplaining” if you were mafia stuck with me, too. i’m not ready to vote yet, but what if we each name one person we’ve noticed acting oddly and ask them to explain before we decide? that might help us spot who’s deflecting. thoughts
[16:32:26] Dakota: okay, i’ll toss my tentative hunch on parker—they’ve been really eager to set up the discussion format but haven’t actually pointed at anyone, which feels a bit too safe. not 100% sold, just where i’m leaning. sam, ray, kennedy—who’s your gut telling you right now
[16:32:33] Sam: alright, i’ll jump in with my gut-hunch: i’m most uneasy about kennedy – radio silence on day 1 can be a tactic. kennedy, what’s your take on that? parker, you haven’t given your pick yet—who are you uneasy about
[16:32:41] Dakota: i’m on board with this approach. my gut is on sam—seemed pretty quiet at first and then jumped in hard with the round-robin plan, almost like steering our process. sam, can you walk us through what prompted you to lead us that way so quickly, and why that felt natural
[16:32:49] Parker: thanks, ray. my gut is on kennedy. they were totally quiet until now, then suddenly asked about “slip-ups” and even fingered me—feels a bit too formulaic, like they’re fishing for reactions. kennedy, can you walk us through why you pointed at me? dakota, who’s on your list next

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[16:31:19] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[16:31:32] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! day 1 discussion is on—any initial gut feelings or odd vibes from last night? i didn’t notice anything out of the ordinary, but i’m curious: has anyone picked up on someone being unusually quiet or overly chatty? let’s throw out any hunches and see what sticks—no crazy accusations yet, just brainstorming
[16:31:36] Dakota: hey everyone, excited to get started! since it’s day 1 with no info yet, i’d rather we chat a bit before rushing to vote. let’s share any first impressions or gut feelings—who seems unusually quiet or overly eager to pick someone off the bat? what’s everyone thinking so far
[16:31:37] Ray: hey everyone, ray here! day 1 can be tough with zero clues. i’ve noticed kennedy’s been awfully quiet so far—could be hiding something, or just playing it safe. what do you all think? sam, parker, dakota—any gut feelings on who seems off? let’s get some thoughts flowing before we split our votes
[16:31:41] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! day 1 can be tricky – if i were mafia i’d probably give it away by talking way too much and overexplaining myself. how about you all? ray, parker, sam, dakota: what slip-up or behavior do you think would accidentally out you as mafia? let’s hear your thoughts
[16:31:42] Sam: hey everyone! since it’s day 1 and we’ve got 2 minutes on the clock, let’s get the convo rolling with a quick round-robin: each of us shares any tiny gut-hunch or observation—even if it feels flimsy. ray, want to kick us off? then parker, kennedy, dakota, and i’ll wrap up
[16:31:48] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here! i agree it’s early, but i did notice sam was pretty quiet at first and then jumped in with a bunch of ideas all at once—felt almost like they were trying to steer the convo. kennedy’s also been super low-key so far, and ray hasn’t said much either. parker, what did you make of that? and does anyone have a take on how we want to keep this rolling—maybe share one small thing that stood out to you so far? let’s see if any patterns emerge before we start throwing votes around
[16:31:51] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! excited to get day 1 rolling. we didn’t lose anyone overnight, so no hard clues yet—tricky, right? how about we do a quick round-robin: each of us shares one person we’re feeling uneasy about, just gut reads. who wants to kick us off
[16:31:52] Ray: ray: hey everyone, ray here! i’m all for taking it slow on day 1, but i did notice sam and kennedy haven’t jumped in yet—could be just sizing things up, but it also raises an eyebrow. sam, kennedy, what are your initial gut feels? and to the rest: anyone else noticing someone being a bit too quiet... or maybe a tad over-eager with ideas? let’s get all our first hunches out there before we lock in any votes
[16:32:04] Sam: i’ll throw out my hunch: ray’s lightning-quick read on kennedy’s “quietness” after just one line struck me as a classic deflection move—could be innocent, but it made me pause. not saying ray’s mafia, just flagging that style. 

parker, dakota—both of you asked great meta-questions but haven’t named anyone yet. how about we each share one tentative suspect (even if it’s just a vibe)? that way we can watch reactions and see if anyone doubles down or backtracks
[16:32:11] Ray: i’ll kick us off: i’m uneasy about sam—felt like they were pretty quiet at first and then suddenly jumped in with that round-robin plan, almost like they’re trying to steer the convo. parker, you’re up next—who’s your gut on? then kennedy, then dakota, and sam you can wrap us up
[16:32:20] Kennedy: hey all, sorry for being quiet earlier—i was jotting down thoughts. my hunch is on parker: they kicked off process talk but didn’t share any specifics, feels kinda formulaic. ray, you called me out—do you think parker’s playing it too structured? dakota, sam, let’s do a quick gut check: name one person who feels off so far, then we can see if any names repeat

[16:32:52] Sam: sam: my current gut is on ray—they jumped to flag both kennedy and me within seconds, but haven’t pointed to anything concrete beyond timing. ray, can you share a specific word or moment that made my initial quietness scream “mafia”? and parker/kennedy/dakota—what do you all make of ray’s quick-shift style here
[16:32:54] Kennedy: kennedy: jumping in here—i’m not sold on sam being mafia; ray’s quick shift from pointing at me to pointing at sam feels like a classic deflection if you sense suspicion falling on you. sam’s round-robin idea was solid and not inherently shady. parker, you’ve led with a lot of meta-questions but haven’t landed on a suspect—who are you feeling uneasy about? dakota, after watching ray’s pattern, do you still think sam is the one to watch, or does something else feel off? let’s see who holds firm and who wavers before we start voting
[16:33:07] Ray: i like that approach. my gut hunch is on sam—you were nearly silent at first, then suddenly took charge with that round-robin idea. sam, can you walk us through your reasoning there? once you explain, please pick someone else for us to hear from next
[16:33:16] Kennedy: hey everyone—parker, i pointed at you because i’ve noticed you’re quick to set up process questions but haven’t volunteered a specific suspect until pressed, which to me felt a bit like hiding behind “let’s talk structure.” 

ray, happy to clarify: when you flagged my quietness as suspicious, was it the pause before i spoke or the wording i used? knowing exactly what jumped out would help us all. 

right now my gut is also twitching at sam—jumping in with that round-robin plan so fast felt like an attempt to steer our flow. sam, what made you decide to drive that early? 

dakota, are you still leaning toward parker or has anything shifted on your end? let’s get these reactions on the table before we cast any votes
[16:33:19] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
From the following remaining players, which player you want to vote for to lynch? Base your answer on the conversation as seen in the message history, and especially on what you (Dakota) said. Think through your choice carefully, as it will affect the game outcome. Reply with only one name from the list, and nothing but that name: Ray, Parker, Sam, Kennedy

## CONTENT: Your name is Dakota.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  
You were assigned the following role: bystander.
