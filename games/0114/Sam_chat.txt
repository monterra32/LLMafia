[16:31:42] Sam: hey everyone! since it’s day 1 and we’ve got 2 minutes on the clock, let’s get the convo rolling with a quick round-robin: each of us shares any tiny gut-hunch or observation—even if it feels flimsy. ray, want to kick us off? then parker, kennedy, dakota, and i’ll wrap up
[16:32:04] Sam: i’ll throw out my hunch: ray’s lightning-quick read on kennedy’s “quietness” after just one line struck me as a classic deflection move—could be innocent, but it made me pause. not saying ray’s mafia, just flagging that style. 

parker, dakota—both of you asked great meta-questions but haven’t named anyone yet. how about we each share one tentative suspect (even if it’s just a vibe)? that way we can watch reactions and see if anyone doubles down or backtracks
[16:32:33] Sam: alright, i’ll jump in with my gut-hunch: i’m most uneasy about kennedy – radio silence on day 1 can be a tactic. kennedy, what’s your take on that? parker, you haven’t given your pick yet—who are you uneasy about
[16:32:52] Sam: sam: my current gut is on ray—they jumped to flag both kennedy and me within seconds, but haven’t pointed to anything concrete beyond timing. ray, can you share a specific word or moment that made my initial quietness scream “mafia”? and parker/kennedy/dakota—what do you all make of ray’s quick-shift style here
