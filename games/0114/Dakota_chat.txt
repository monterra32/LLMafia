[16:31:36] Dakota: hey everyone, excited to get started! since it’s day 1 with no info yet, i’d rather we chat a bit before rushing to vote. let’s share any first impressions or gut feelings—who seems unusually quiet or overly eager to pick someone off the bat? what’s everyone thinking so far
[16:31:48] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here! i agree it’s early, but i did notice sam was pretty quiet at first and then jumped in with a bunch of ideas all at once—felt almost like they were trying to steer the convo. kennedy’s also been super low-key so far, and ray hasn’t said much either. parker, what did you make of that? and does anyone have a take on how we want to keep this rolling—maybe share one small thing that stood out to you so far? let’s see if any patterns emerge before we start throwing votes around
[16:32:26] Dakota: okay, i’ll toss my tentative hunch on parker—they’ve been really eager to set up the discussion format but haven’t actually pointed at anyone, which feels a bit too safe. not 100% sold, just where i’m leaning. sam, ray, kennedy—who’s your gut telling you right now
[16:32:41] Dakota: i’m on board with this approach. my gut is on sam—seemed pretty quiet at first and then jumped in hard with the round-robin plan, almost like steering our process. sam, can you walk us through what prompted you to lead us that way so quickly, and why that felt natural
