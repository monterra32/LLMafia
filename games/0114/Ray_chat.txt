[16:31:37] Ray: hey everyone, ray here! day 1 can be tough with zero clues. i’ve noticed kennedy’s been awfully quiet so far—could be hiding something, or just playing it safe. what do you all think? sam, parker, dakota—any gut feelings on who seems off? let’s get some thoughts flowing before we split our votes
[16:31:52] Ray: ray: hey everyone, ray here! i’m all for taking it slow on day 1, but i did notice sam and kennedy haven’t jumped in yet—could be just sizing things up, but it also raises an eyebrow. sam, kennedy, what are your initial gut feels? and to the rest: anyone else noticing someone being a bit too quiet... or maybe a tad over-eager with ideas? let’s get all our first hunches out there before we lock in any votes
[16:32:11] Ray: i’ll kick us off: i’m uneasy about sam—felt like they were pretty quiet at first and then suddenly jumped in with that round-robin plan, almost like they’re trying to steer the convo. parker, you’re up next—who’s your gut on? then kennedy, then dakota, and sam you can wrap us up
[16:33:07] Ray: i like that approach. my gut hunch is on sam—you were nearly silent at first, then suddenly took charge with that round-robin idea. sam, can you walk us through your reasoning there? once you explain, please pick someone else for us to hear from next
