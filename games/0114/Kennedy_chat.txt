[16:31:41] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! day 1 can be tricky – if i were mafia i’d probably give it away by talking way too much and overexplaining myself. how about you all? ray, parker, sam, dakota: what slip-up or behavior do you think would accidentally out you as mafia? let’s hear your thoughts
[16:32:20] Kennedy: hey all, sorry for being quiet earlier—i was jotting down thoughts. my hunch is on parker: they kicked off process talk but didn’t share any specifics, feels kinda formulaic. ray, you called me out—do you think parker’s playing it too structured? dakota, sam, let’s do a quick gut check: name one person who feels off so far, then we can see if any names repeat
[16:32:54] Kennedy: kennedy: jumping in here—i’m not sold on sam being mafia; ray’s quick shift from pointing at me to pointing at sam feels like a classic deflection if you sense suspicion falling on you. sam’s round-robin idea was solid and not inherently shady. parker, you’ve led with a lot of meta-questions but haven’t landed on a suspect—who are you feeling uneasy about? dakota, after watching ray’s pattern, do you still think sam is the one to watch, or does something else feel off? let’s see who holds firm and who wavers before we start voting
[16:33:16] Kennedy: hey everyone—parker, i pointed at you because i’ve noticed you’re quick to set up process questions but haven’t volunteered a specific suspect until pressed, which to me felt a bit like hiding behind “let’s talk structure.” 

ray, happy to clarify: when you flagged my quietness as suspicious, was it the pause before i spoke or the wording i used? knowing exactly what jumped out would help us all. 

right now my gut is also twitching at sam—jumping in with that round-robin plan so fast felt like an attempt to steer our flow. sam, what made you decide to drive that early? 

dakota, are you still leaning toward parker or has anything shifted on your end? let’s get these reactions on the table before we cast any votes
