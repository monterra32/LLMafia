[16:43:02] Ray: hey everyone, ray here. i’m still getting a feel for things—initial impressions? sam you were pretty quiet to start, parker you jumped right in—both could be red flags or reverse psychology. who’s standing out for you so far, and which way are you leaning for our vote
[16:43:40] Ray: hey sam, parker, kennedy, dakota—i agree it’s a bit early to lock in anyone, but i’m keeping an eye on the quiet ones. kennedy and dakota haven’t said a word yet, which feels odd, while parker at least jumped in. i’m not ready to vote, but why don’t we each name one suspect and a quick reason to get some meat on the bones? i’ll say kennedy for now—who’s yours
[16:44:17] Ray: i flagged sam’s quiet start because beyond saying they’d watch for “quiet vs eager” players, they haven’t offered any concrete suspicions or named anyone—feels a bit evasive. as for my gut right now, i’m eyeing kennedy: they’ve been promising to chime in last but still haven’t given a real read of their own. what do you all think
[16:44:30] Ray: i’m leaning toward voting parker right now. parker, you were the first to jump on kennedy’s “silence is a shield” theory—no concrete examples, just a blanket accusation. that kind of early framing feels off. and dakota immediately echoed that same angle, almost word-for-word, which to me looks like coordinated narrative. with sam and kennedy also naming parker, i’m ready to lock it in unless you can explain why you singled out kennedy so quickly. parker, what’s your defense
[16:47:51] Ray: ray: hey kennedy, dakota—just us three now, so let’s be efficient. i’m uneasy about kennedy’s play: on day 1 she offered zero concrete reads, then jumped on parker with no evidence, and since sam died she’s been almost radio-silent. that defensive pattern feels mafia-y. i’m voting kennedy. dakota, do you see it the same way? if not, who are you leaning toward? let’s lock it in before time’s up
