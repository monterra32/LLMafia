[16:43:10] Parker: hello everyone! parker here. since it’s day 1 and we’ve all been quiet so far, let’s share our gut reads—name one player you’d vote for and why. i’ll start: i’m a bit wary of kennedy—they’ve said almost nothing, and sometimes silence is a shield. your turn, ray
[16:43:43] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! i’m not seeing any glaring mafia tells yet—everyone’s playing it pretty safe so far. kennedy flagging dakota’s silence and sam calling out quick jumps both make sense, but could also be over-analysis on day one. instead of more general gut feels, how about each of us point to one specific phrase, timing, or reaction so far that felt off? ray, dakota—what’s one small thing you noticed? i’ll hold off voting until we get something a bit more concrete. thoughts
[16:44:06] Parker: i’ll go with kennedy—they’ve been almost completely silent even when prompted, which feels more like protective cover than cautious town play. not set in stone, but that’s my gut. ray, sam, dakota: who’s your pick, and why? let’s see if any names repeat
[16:44:40] Parker: sam, fair point on me zeroing in on kennedy too fast—my day-one nerves. i flagged them because they’re still offering questions but no solid reads, but that alone is thin. ray, when you penciled in kennedy, what exact line or moment gave you pause? dakota, you mentioned my eagerness might be cover—what about my wording felt off to you? and kennedy, since you’ve been observing, can you share one small thing someone else said that stood out? i’m still mildly leaning kennedy, but if we can’t back it with something beyond silence, i’ll shift—let’s get those concrete nuggets before locking in a vote
