[16:43:01] Sam: hey everyone, sam here! since it’s our first day and nobody’s said much yet, i’m going to be watching for who’s too quiet or who jumps on someone without evidence. what are your gut feelings right now? ray, parker, kennedy, dakota—any initial reads before we start locking in votes
[16:43:33] Sam: hey everyone! sam here—ready to get the ball rolling. i haven’t picked up anything glaring yet, but i noticed parker and dakota have been pretty quiet so far. anyone want to throw out a first suspect or share your gut read? let’s see who’s looking the most suspicious before time runs out
[16:43:57] Sam: dakota, your intro felt cautious but not alarmingly strategic—you jumped in with good follow-ups, so i’m comfortable with your play. parker’s lightning-quick focus on kennedy feels a bit pushy—could be confidence, could be framing. ray is playing it very safe so far, but we need to press him: ray, if you had to vote right now, who’s it going to be? 

kennedy, you called out dakota at first—do you still feel that way or has someone else caught your eye? i’m mildly leaning toward kennedy purely on silence (it’s day 1, so that’s weak evidence), but i’ll shift if you convince me otherwise. let’s get those takes before we lock anything in
[16:44:32] Sam: hey team—i’m still tentatively leaning toward kennedy based on the continued silence when we’ve pressed for specifics. parker’s talkative push makes sense as a townie trying to drive a discussion, but kennedy hasn’t really given us anything concrete yet. that said, i don’t want to be the lone vote.  

ray—if you had to pick right now, who’s on your shortlist?  
dakota—what’s your gut after hearing parker, kennedy, and my takes?  

if we can consolidate three votes on one person, let’s lock it in before time’s up. otherwise we risk scattering
