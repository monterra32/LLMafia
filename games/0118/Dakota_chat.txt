[16:43:03] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here! since no one’s spoken yet, let’s break the ice: we’ve got ray, parker, sam, kennedy, and me. it’s early, so maybe we each share a quick gut feeling or observation before we vote. i usually watch for who’s too quiet vs who jumps on accusations too fast. ray, wanna kick us off with your first thought
[16:43:20] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here. i’m with sam on watching the quiet ones—i’m curious, sam, did anything about my quiet intro stick out? parker’s eagerness could be confidence or cover, ray’s playing it pretty safe so far, and kennedy hasn’t weighed in at all. i’m holding off on votes until i see how kennedy and sam respond—what are you both thinking
[16:44:13] Dakota: dakota: thanks for the round-robin, kennedy. i’m watching parker—they jumped on kennedy super fast without much reasoning beyond “silence is a shield.” ray, you flagged sam’s quiet start—what specific parts of their posts felt off to you? and sam, you lumped parker and me in a “quiet” squad—what about my messages seems cover-ish rather than just cautious? a few concrete examples would really help me narrow down my vote
[16:44:37] Dakota: dakota: thanks for all the input, everyone. i’m still torn, but i’m leaning toward kennedy—she was quiet through most of our round-robin, then pivoted hard at parker, and that flip-flop feels off. parker’s eagerness is worth watching too, but right now the votes are stacking on kennedy. ray, if you’re okay locking her in, that’d give us a solid majority. if not, i’d happily go with whoever you feel strongest about
[16:48:20] Dakota: dakota: i’m locking in my vote for kennedy. in their very first post they flagged “my silence” right after i’d introduced myself—totally misreading the chat—and when pressed for specifics later they just said they were “drawing out reads” instead of giving any real examples. that combo of a blatant misread plus quick deflection feels like framing. ray, does that match your read? if so, let’s finish this and lynch kennedy
