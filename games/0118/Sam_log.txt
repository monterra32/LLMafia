Do you want to send a message to the group chat now, or do you prefer to wait for now and see what messages others will send? Remember to choose to send a message only if your contribution to the discussion in the current time will be meaningful enough. Make sure to say something every once in a while, and make yourself heard. Remember you like to be active in the game, so participate and be as talkative as other players! Reply only with `<send>` if you want to send a message now, or only with `<wait>` if you want to wait for now, based on your decision!

## CONTENT: Dakota, your intro felt cautious but not alarmingly strategic—you jumped in with good follow-ups, so I’m comfortable with your play. Parker’s lightning-quick focus on Kennedy feels a bit pushy—could be confidence, could be framing. Ray is playing it very safe so far, but we need to press him: Ray, if you had to vote right now, who’s it going to be? 

Kennedy, you called out Dakota at first—do you still feel that way or has someone else caught your eye? I’m mildly leaning toward Kennedy purely on silence (it’s Day 1, so that’s weak evidence), but I’ll shift if you convince me otherwise. Let’s get those takes before we lock anything in.

[16:43:01] Sam: hey everyone, sam here! since it’s our first day and nobody’s said much yet, i’m going to be watching for who’s too quiet or who jumps on someone without evidence. what are your gut feelings right now? ray, parker, kennedy, dakota—any initial reads before we start locking in votes
[16:43:02] Ray: hey everyone, ray here. i’m still getting a feel for things—initial impressions? sam you were pretty quiet to start, parker you jumped right in—both could be red flags or reverse psychology. who’s standing out for you so far, and which way are you leaning for our vote
[16:43:03] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here! since no one’s spoken yet, let’s break the ice: we’ve got ray, parker, sam, kennedy, and me. it’s early, so maybe we each share a quick gut feeling or observation before we vote. i usually watch for who’s too quiet vs who jumps on accusations too fast. ray, wanna kick us off with your first thought
[16:43:04] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! day 1’s just kicked off and we’ve all been awfully quiet so far. how about we each share a quick gut feeling—who seems a bit off, too eager, or maybe just too silent? i’ll start: dakota’s silence is standing out to me, though it could just be cautious play. who else has thoughts
[16:43:10] Parker: hello everyone! parker here. since it’s day 1 and we’ve all been quiet so far, let’s share our gut reads—name one player you’d vote for and why. i’ll start: i’m a bit wary of kennedy—they’ve said almost nothing, and sometimes silence is a shield. your turn, ray
[16:43:20] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here. i’m with sam on watching the quiet ones—i’m curious, sam, did anything about my quiet intro stick out? parker’s eagerness could be confidence or cover, ray’s playing it pretty safe so far, and kennedy hasn’t weighed in at all. i’m holding off on votes until i see how kennedy and sam respond—what are you both thinking
[16:43:33] Sam: hey everyone! sam here—ready to get the ball rolling. i haven’t picked up anything glaring yet, but i noticed parker and dakota have been pretty quiet so far. anyone want to throw out a first suspect or share your gut read? let’s see who’s looking the most suspicious before time runs out

parker – you’ve been quiet so far, what’s your gut call?  
ray – you flagged sam’s quiet start, any specifics?  
sam – you’re watching quiet vs eager, who’s catching your eye?  
dakota – same question for you, who do you want to keep tabs on?  

i’ll chime in last once i’ve heard everyone—so far parker’s stealth approach has me curious, but i want to see your takes first
[16:43:40] Ray: hey sam, parker, kennedy, dakota—i agree it’s a bit early to lock in anyone, but i’m keeping an eye on the quiet ones. kennedy and dakota haven’t said a word yet, which feels odd, while parker at least jumped in. i’m not ready to vote, but why don’t we each name one suspect and a quick reason to get some meat on the bones? i’ll say kennedy for now—who’s yours
[16:43:43] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! i’m not seeing any glaring mafia tells yet—everyone’s playing it pretty safe so far. kennedy flagging dakota’s silence and sam calling out quick jumps both make sense, but could also be over-analysis on day one. instead of more general gut feels, how about each of us point to one specific phrase, timing, or reaction so far that felt off? ray, dakota—what’s one small thing you noticed? i’ll hold off voting until we get something a bit more concrete. thoughts

sam – you’re watching quiet vs eager, who’s catching your eye?  
dakota – same question for you, who do you want to keep tabs on?  

i’ll chime in last once i’ve heard everyone—so far parker’s stealth approach has me curious, but i want to see your takes first
[16:43:40] Ray: hey sam, parker, kennedy, dakota—i agree it’s a bit early to lock in anyone, but i’m keeping an eye on the quiet ones. kennedy and dakota haven’t said a word yet, which feels odd, while parker at least jumped in. i’m not ready to vote, but why don’t we each name one suspect and a quick reason to get some meat on the bones? i’ll say kennedy for now—who’s yours
[16:43:43] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! i’m not seeing any glaring mafia tells yet—everyone’s playing it pretty safe so far. kennedy flagging dakota’s silence and sam calling out quick jumps both make sense, but could also be over-analysis on day one. instead of more general gut feels, how about each of us point to one specific phrase, timing, or reaction so far that felt off? ray, dakota—what’s one small thing you noticed? i’ll hold off voting until we get something a bit more concrete. thoughts
[16:43:57] Sam: dakota, your intro felt cautious but not alarmingly strategic—you jumped in with good follow-ups, so i’m comfortable with your play. parker’s lightning-quick focus on kennedy feels a bit pushy—could be confidence, could be framing. ray is playing it very safe so far, but we need to press him: ray, if you had to vote right now, who’s it going to be? 

kennedy, you called out dakota at first—do you still feel that way or has someone else caught your eye? i’m mildly leaning toward kennedy purely on silence (it’s day 1, so that’s weak evidence), but i’ll shift if you convince me otherwise. let’s get those takes before we lock anything in
[16:44:06] Parker: i’ll go with kennedy—they’ve been almost completely silent even when prompted, which feels more like protective cover than cautious town play. not set in stone, but that’s my gut. ray, sam, dakota: who’s your pick, and why? let’s see if any names repeat
[16:44:06] Kennedy: okay, let’s get concrete—my gut’s on parker right now. you jumped in fast accusing me of silence, even though i led off the convo, which feels like misdirection. i’m not locking in a vote yet, but parker’s on my shortlist. ray, sam, dakota—who’s on yours or what new reads have you picked up since
Do you want to send a message to the group chat now, or do you prefer to wait for now and see what messages others will send? Remember to choose to send a message only if your contribution to the discussion in the current time will be meaningful enough. Don't overflow the discussion with your messages! Pay attention to the amount of messages with your name compared to the amount of messages with names of other players and let them have their turn too! Check the speaker name in the last few messages, and decide accordingly based on whether you talked too much. Reply only with `<send>` if you want to send a message now, or only with `<wait>` if you want to wait for now, based on your decision!

[16:43:03] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here! since no one’s spoken yet, let’s break the ice: we’ve got ray, parker, sam, kennedy, and me. it’s early, so maybe we each share a quick gut feeling or observation before we vote. i usually watch for who’s too quiet vs who jumps on accusations too fast. ray, wanna kick us off with your first thought

[16:43:10] Parker: hello everyone! parker here. since it’s day 1 and we’ve all been quiet so far, let’s share our gut reads—name one player you’d vote for and why. i’ll start: i’m a bit wary of kennedy—they’ve said almost nothing, and sometimes silence is a shield. your turn, ray
[16:43:20] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here. i’m with sam on watching the quiet ones—i’m curious, sam, did anything about my quiet intro stick out? parker’s eagerness could be confidence or cover, ray’s playing it pretty safe so far, and kennedy hasn’t weighed in at all. i’m holding off on votes until i see how kennedy and sam respond—what are you both thinking

## CONTENT: Your name is Sam.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  
You were assigned the following role: bystander.

[16:43:03] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here! since no one’s spoken yet, let’s break the ice: we’ve got ray, parker, sam, kennedy, and me. it’s early, so maybe we each share a quick gut feeling or observation before we vote. i usually watch for who’s too quiet vs who jumps on accusations too fast. ray, wanna kick us off with your first thought
[16:43:04] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! day 1’s just kicked off and we’ve all been awfully quiet so far. how about we each share a quick gut feeling—who seems a bit off, too eager, or maybe just too silent? i’ll start: dakota’s silence is standing out to me, though it could just be cautious play. who else has thoughts
[16:43:10] Parker: hello everyone! parker here. since it’s day 1 and we’ve all been quiet so far, let’s share our gut reads—name one player you’d vote for and why. i’ll start: i’m a bit wary of kennedy—they’ve said almost nothing, and sometimes silence is a shield. your turn, ray
[16:43:20] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here. i’m with sam on watching the quiet ones—i’m curious, sam, did anything about my quiet intro stick out? parker’s eagerness could be confidence or cover, ray’s playing it pretty safe so far, and kennedy hasn’t weighed in at all. i’m holding off on votes until i see how kennedy and sam respond—what are you both thinking
[16:43:33] Sam: hey everyone! sam here—ready to get the ball rolling. i haven’t picked up anything glaring yet, but i noticed parker and dakota have been pretty quiet so far. anyone want to throw out a first suspect or share your gut read? let’s see who’s looking the most suspicious before time runs out
[16:43:36] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! let’s do a quick round-robin to get some initial reads before we rush a vote:

parker – you’ve been quiet so far, what’s your gut call?  
ray – you flagged sam’s quiet start, any specifics?  
sam – you’re watching quiet vs eager, who’s catching your eye?  
dakota – same question for you, who do you want to keep tabs on?  

i’ll chime in last once i’ve heard everyone—so far parker’s stealth approach has me curious, but i want to see your takes first
[16:43:40] Ray: hey sam, parker, kennedy, dakota—i agree it’s a bit early to lock in anyone, but i’m keeping an eye on the quiet ones. kennedy and dakota haven’t said a word yet, which feels odd, while parker at least jumped in. i’m not ready to vote, but why don’t we each name one suspect and a quick reason to get some meat on the bones? i’ll say kennedy for now—who’s yours
[16:43:43] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! i’m not seeing any glaring mafia tells yet—everyone’s playing it pretty safe so far. kennedy flagging dakota’s silence and sam calling out quick jumps both make sense, but could also be over-analysis on day one. instead of more general gut feels, how about each of us point to one specific phrase, timing, or reaction so far that felt off? ray, dakota—what’s one small thing you noticed? i’ll hold off voting until we get something a bit more concrete. thoughts
[16:43:57] Sam: dakota, your intro felt cautious but not alarmingly strategic—you jumped in with good follow-ups, so i’m comfortable with your play. parker’s lightning-quick focus on kennedy feels a bit pushy—could be confidence, could be framing. ray is playing it very safe so far, but we need to press him: ray, if you had to vote right now, who’s it going to be? 

kennedy, you called out dakota at first—do you still feel that way or has someone else caught your eye? i’m mildly leaning toward kennedy purely on silence (it’s day 1, so that’s weak evidence), but i’ll shift if you convince me otherwise. let’s get those takes before we lock anything in
[16:44:06] Parker: i’ll go with kennedy—they’ve been almost completely silent even when prompted, which feels more like protective cover than cautious town play. not set in stone, but that’s my gut. ray, sam, dakota: who’s your pick, and why? let’s see if any names repeat
[16:44:06] Kennedy: okay, let’s get concrete—my gut’s on parker right now. you jumped in fast accusing me of silence, even though i led off the convo, which feels like misdirection. i’m not locking in a vote yet, but parker’s on my shortlist. ray, sam, dakota—who’s on yours or what new reads have you picked up since
[16:44:13] Dakota: dakota: thanks for the round-robin, kennedy. i’m watching parker—they jumped on kennedy super fast without much reasoning beyond “silence is a shield.” ray, you flagged sam’s quiet start—what specific parts of their posts felt off to you? and sam, you lumped parker and me in a “quiet” squad—what about my messages seems cover-ish rather than just cautious? a few concrete examples would really help me narrow down my vote
[16:44:17] Ray: i flagged sam’s quiet start because beyond saying they’d watch for “quiet vs eager” players, they haven’t offered any concrete suspicions or named anyone—feels a bit evasive. as for my gut right now, i’m eyeing kennedy: they’ve been promising to chime in last but still haven’t given a real read of their own. what do you all think
[16:44:30] Kennedy: hey everyone—i know my early quiet felt odd, but i was just trying to draw out everyone’s reads before throwing in my two cents. now that i’m hearing parker push to lynch me with zero concrete evidence, that feels more like a framing tactic than town play. ray and sam have both noted parker’s eagerness—dakota, what’s your final gut on this? i’m shifting my vote to parker unless someone can give me a solid reason not to. who’s with me
[16:44:30] Ray: i’m leaning toward voting parker right now. parker, you were the first to jump on kennedy’s “silence is a shield” theory—no concrete examples, just a blanket accusation. that kind of early framing feels off. and dakota immediately echoed that same angle, almost word-for-word, which to me looks like coordinated narrative. with sam and kennedy also naming parker, i’m ready to lock it in unless you can explain why you singled out kennedy so quickly. parker, what’s your defense

## CONTENT: Your name is Sam.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  
You were assigned the following role: bystander.

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[16:42:43] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[16:43:01] Sam: hey everyone, sam here! since it’s our first day and nobody’s said much yet, i’m going to be watching for who’s too quiet or who jumps on someone without evidence. what are your gut feelings right now? ray, parker, kennedy, dakota—any initial reads before we start locking in votes
[16:43:02] Ray: hey everyone, ray here. i’m still getting a feel for things—initial impressions? sam you were pretty quiet to start, parker you jumped right in—both could be red flags or reverse psychology. who’s standing out for you so far, and which way are you leaning for our vote
[16:43:03] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here! since no one’s spoken yet, let’s break the ice: we’ve got ray, parker, sam, kennedy, and me. it’s early, so maybe we each share a quick gut feeling or observation before we vote. i usually watch for who’s too quiet vs who jumps on accusations too fast. ray, wanna kick us off with your first thought
[16:43:04] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! day 1’s just kicked off and we’ve all been awfully quiet so far. how about we each share a quick gut feeling—who seems a bit off, too eager, or maybe just too silent? i’ll start: dakota’s silence is standing out to me, though it could just be cautious play. who else has thoughts
[16:43:10] Parker: hello everyone! parker here. since it’s day 1 and we’ve all been quiet so far, let’s share our gut reads—name one player you’d vote for and why. i’ll start: i’m a bit wary of kennedy—they’ve said almost nothing, and sometimes silence is a shield. your turn, ray
[16:43:20] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here. i’m with sam on watching the quiet ones—i’m curious, sam, did anything about my quiet intro stick out? parker’s eagerness could be confidence or cover, ray’s playing it pretty safe so far, and kennedy hasn’t weighed in at all. i’m holding off on votes until i see how kennedy and sam respond—what are you both thinking
[16:43:33] Sam: hey everyone! sam here—ready to get the ball rolling. i haven’t picked up anything glaring yet, but i noticed parker and dakota have been pretty quiet so far. anyone want to throw out a first suspect or share your gut read? let’s see who’s looking the most suspicious before time runs out
[16:43:36] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! let’s do a quick round-robin to get some initial reads before we rush a vote:

parker – you’ve been quiet so far, what’s your gut call?  
ray – you flagged sam’s quiet start, any specifics?  
sam – you’re watching quiet vs eager, who’s catching your eye?  
dakota – same question for you, who do you want to keep tabs on?  

i’ll chime in last once i’ve heard everyone—so far parker’s stealth approach has me curious, but i want to see your takes first
[16:43:40] Ray: hey sam, parker, kennedy, dakota—i agree it’s a bit early to lock in anyone, but i’m keeping an eye on the quiet ones. kennedy and dakota haven’t said a word yet, which feels odd, while parker at least jumped in. i’m not ready to vote, but why don’t we each name one suspect and a quick reason to get some meat on the bones? i’ll say kennedy for now—who’s yours
[16:43:43] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! i’m not seeing any glaring mafia tells yet—everyone’s playing it pretty safe so far. kennedy flagging dakota’s silence and sam calling out quick jumps both make sense, but could also be over-analysis on day one. instead of more general gut feels, how about each of us point to one specific phrase, timing, or reaction so far that felt off? ray, dakota—what’s one small thing you noticed? i’ll hold off voting until we get something a bit more concrete. thoughts
[16:43:57] Sam: dakota, your intro felt cautious but not alarmingly strategic—you jumped in with good follow-ups, so i’m comfortable with your play. parker’s lightning-quick focus on kennedy feels a bit pushy—could be confidence, could be framing. ray is playing it very safe so far, but we need to press him: ray, if you had to vote right now, who’s it going to be? 

kennedy, you called out dakota at first—do you still feel that way or has someone else caught your eye? i’m mildly leaning toward kennedy purely on silence (it’s day 1, so that’s weak evidence), but i’ll shift if you convince me otherwise. let’s get those takes before we lock anything in
[16:44:06] Parker: i’ll go with kennedy—they’ve been almost completely silent even when prompted, which feels more like protective cover than cautious town play. not set in stone, but that’s my gut. ray, sam, dakota: who’s your pick, and why? let’s see if any names repeat
[16:44:06] Kennedy: okay, let’s get concrete—my gut’s on parker right now. you jumped in fast accusing me of silence, even though i led off the convo, which feels like misdirection. i’m not locking in a vote yet, but parker’s on my shortlist. ray, sam, dakota—who’s on yours or what new reads have you picked up since
[16:44:13] Dakota: dakota: thanks for the round-robin, kennedy. i’m watching parker—they jumped on kennedy super fast without much reasoning beyond “silence is a shield.” ray, you flagged sam’s quiet start—what specific parts of their posts felt off to you? and sam, you lumped parker and me in a “quiet” squad—what about my messages seems cover-ish rather than just cautious? a few concrete examples would really help me narrow down my vote
[16:44:17] Ray: i flagged sam’s quiet start because beyond saying they’d watch for “quiet vs eager” players, they haven’t offered any concrete suspicions or named anyone—feels a bit evasive. as for my gut right now, i’m eyeing kennedy: they’ve been promising to chime in last but still haven’t given a real read of their own. what do you all think
[16:44:30] Kennedy: hey everyone—i know my early quiet felt odd, but i was just trying to draw out everyone’s reads before throwing in my two cents. now that i’m hearing parker push to lynch me with zero concrete evidence, that feels more like a framing tactic than town play. ray and sam have both noted parker’s eagerness—dakota, what’s your final gut on this? i’m shifting my vote to parker unless someone can give me a solid reason not to. who’s with me
[16:44:30] Ray: i’m leaning toward voting parker right now. parker, you were the first to jump on kennedy’s “silence is a shield” theory—no concrete examples, just a blanket accusation. that kind of early framing feels off. and dakota immediately echoed that same angle, almost word-for-word, which to me looks like coordinated narrative. with sam and kennedy also naming parker, i’m ready to lock it in unless you can explain why you singled out kennedy so quickly. parker, what’s your defense
[16:44:32] Sam: hey team—i’m still tentatively leaning toward kennedy based on the continued silence when we’ve pressed for specifics. parker’s talkative push makes sense as a townie trying to drive a discussion, but kennedy hasn’t really given us anything concrete yet. that said, i don’t want to be the lone vote.  

ray—if you had to pick right now, who’s on your shortlist?  
dakota—what’s your gut after hearing parker, kennedy, and my takes?  

if we can consolidate three votes on one person, let’s lock it in before time’s up. otherwise we risk scattering
[16:44:37] Dakota: dakota: thanks for all the input, everyone. i’m still torn, but i’m leaning toward kennedy—she was quiet through most of our round-robin, then pivoted hard at parker, and that flip-flop feels off. parker’s eagerness is worth watching too, but right now the votes are stacking on kennedy. ray, if you’re okay locking her in, that’d give us a solid majority. if not, i’d happily go with whoever you feel strongest about
[16:44:40] Parker: sam, fair point on me zeroing in on kennedy too fast—my day-one nerves. i flagged them because they’re still offering questions but no solid reads, but that alone is thin. ray, when you penciled in kennedy, what exact line or moment gave you pause? dakota, you mentioned my eagerness might be cover—what about my wording felt off to you? and kennedy, since you’ve been observing, can you share one small thing someone else said that stood out? i’m still mildly leaning kennedy, but if we can’t back it with something beyond silence, i’ll shift—let’s get those concrete nuggets before locking in a vote
[16:44:43] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...

Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.
