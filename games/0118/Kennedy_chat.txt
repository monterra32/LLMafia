[16:43:04] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! day 1’s just kicked off and we’ve all been awfully quiet so far. how about we each share a quick gut feeling—who seems a bit off, too eager, or maybe just too silent? i’ll start: dakota’s silence is standing out to me, though it could just be cautious play. who else has thoughts
[16:43:36] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! let’s do a quick round-robin to get some initial reads before we rush a vote:

parker – you’ve been quiet so far, what’s your gut call?  
ray – you flagged sam’s quiet start, any specifics?  
sam – you’re watching quiet vs eager, who’s catching your eye?  
dakota – same question for you, who do you want to keep tabs on?  

i’ll chime in last once i’ve heard everyone—so far parker’s stealth approach has me curious, but i want to see your takes first
[16:44:06] Kennedy: okay, let’s get concrete—my gut’s on parker right now. you jumped in fast accusing me of silence, even though i led off the convo, which feels like misdirection. i’m not locking in a vote yet, but parker’s on my shortlist. ray, sam, dakota—who’s on yours or what new reads have you picked up since
[16:44:30] Kennedy: hey everyone—i know my early quiet felt odd, but i was just trying to draw out everyone’s reads before throwing in my two cents. now that i’m hearing parker push to lynch me with zero concrete evidence, that feels more like a framing tactic than town play. ray and sam have both noted parker’s eagerness—dakota, what’s your final gut on this? i’m shifting my vote to parker unless someone can give me a solid reason not to. who’s with me
[16:47:55] Kennedy: alright, ray and dakota—only three of us remain, two town, one mafia, so we need two votes to seal this. i’m leaning hard on ray. ray, you haven’t given us any concrete reads—day 1 it was just “quiet is suspicious,” and today you’ve been quiet again. i’m going to vote for you unless you can give me a real reason not to. dakota, will you join me on ray or do you see something i’m missing
[16:48:23] Kennedy: kennedy: okay, ray—i hear you want to be efficient, but i need more than “radio silence” to convict someone. on day 1 you zeroed in on me for being quiet with no concrete examples, then you did it again just now. meanwhile you flagged sam for being quiet, flipped to me, and never pointed to a single shady phrase of mine. that pattern of framing looks exactly like what mafia would do. dakota, you’ve been more measured—what specifically from ray’s posts sticks out to you as town-y or mafia-y? unless ray can point to real evidence against me, i’m ready to vote him out. let’s get some substance on the table before we lock this
