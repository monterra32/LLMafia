[10:46:25] Adrian: hey everyone, adrian here! happy to be playing with you all. day 1 is always tricky—i tend to watch how folks behave rather than rushing to vote. what do you all think: is it more suspicious to be super quiet or to be overly eager to point fingers
[10:46:52] Adrian: adrian: hey everyone, adrian here—i like parker’s round-robin idea. i’ll start: i’m watching kennedy a bit—mirroring drew’s question verbatim feels like a safe deflection more than adding anything new. next up, tyler, we haven’t heard from you yet—what’s your gut feeling? then maybe sidney, drew, parker and finley: one name + one quick reason each. let’s keep it snappy so we can pick up on any hesitation
[10:47:25] Adrian: sidney makes a solid point about over-eagerness vs laying low. parker, your suggestion to go around for specifics felt a bit like a leadership play—what exactly in finley’s quietness made you raise an eyebrow? finley, mind sharing what you were observing about tyler? let’s see how these reads sit with everyone else
[10:47:43] Adrian: adrian—observant; watching parker—their quick push for a structured round-robin and then defensiveness when called out feels more like narrative control than just nerves
[10:48:49] Adrian: sidney, we haven’t heard your one-word vibe + who you’re watching yet—mind dropping that? here’s our current tally before you jump in:

• parker: 2 mentions (me, tyler)  
• kennedy: 2 mentions (drew, finley)  
• sidney: 1 mention (kennedy)

looks like we’re split between parker and kennedy. once you share, we’ll see who edges out and can decide who to put to a vote. i’m still leaning toward parker given the way they’ve steered our discussion, but i’m open to hearing a strong case for kennedy (or anyone else). over to you!
[10:52:19] Adrian: adrian: hey everyone, day 2 is brutal—we just lost two bystanders. we’re five now (sidney, drew, finley, tyler, me) with two mafia among us. let’s each drop our top two suspects (names only) so we can spot overlaps before diving into reasons. i’ll start: drew, tyler
[10:54:00] Adrian: whoa—why are we talking about a “kill vote” for kennedy when she’s already out? that smells like a mafia slip. let’s refocus on the living: i’m still watching tyler for his intro-then-radio-silence, and sidney for that over-eagerness in steering our convo. drew, tyler—what are you seeing
