[10:46:24] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! day 1 and no one was taken last night, so all eyes are on us. i’d love to hear any gut feelings—did anyone notice something off or someone acting unusually quiet (or too eager)? who should we keep an eye on first
[10:46:42] Kennedy: hey all, kennedy here—super pumped to play! i agree it’s early, but i’ve noticed sidney has been a bit on the quiet side while parker jumped right in with suggestions. both could be totally harmless, of course, but i’m curious if anyone else is picking up on pacing or tone differences. also, do you prefer laying low and gathering info first, or starting to float a suspect list right away? would love to hear your thoughts
[10:46:59] Kennedy: kennedy here—since everyone’s sharing hunches, i’m curious: sidney, you flagged parker pretty quickly—what specifically in parker’s replies felt strategic instead of just nervous? and parker, you said finley’s quietness stood out—was it their timing, tone, or something else? getting those details might help us tell nerves from strategy. personally, i’m also keeping an eye on tyler—their big “hey everyone” then radio silence feels worth watching. what do you all think
[10:47:39] Kennedy: kennedy — cautious; i’m watching sidney because her quick, textbook breakdown of “over-eagerness vs silence” felt rehearsed rather than reactive—like she came in with a script. curious to see how she answers if we press her on real examples
[10:48:53] Kennedy: kennedy — cautious; i’m watching parker and sidney. parker’s proposed the structured round-robins twice and then dodged specifics whenever pressed. sidney led with that perfect “over-eagerness vs silence” script but hasn’t backed it with any real examples. to make progress, let’s each drop our top two suspects with one-sentence reasons—no more frameworks. i’ll start:  
• parker — steering the convo without offering evidence  
• sidney — scripted breakdown with zero concrete proof  
your turn!
