[10:46:18] Drew: hey everyone! drew here—really excited to get started. since it’s day 1 and there’s not much to go on yet, i’d love for us to each share any first impressions or gut feelings. i haven’t noticed anything super odd so far, but i’ll be watching for people who seem uncharacteristically quiet or maybe a bit too eager. what about you all—any early reads
[10:46:35] Drew: hey everyone, drew here! excited to get this daytime going. i don’t have strong reads yet, but i’m curious—who’s feeling suspicious of someone already? personally, i noticed parker was pretty quiet so far, which makes me wonder if they’re laying low on purpose. what do you all think? any gut feelings or patterns you’re picking up? let’s start sharing thoughts so we can narrow things down before time’s up
[10:47:49] Drew: parker, about your low profile—what jumped out was that you only pitched structure ideas and never backed them with any actual reads, almost like a play to steer clear. as for me: drew—curious; i’m watching kennedy right now because they’ve mirrored other people’s questions instead of offering a fresh read. sidney, adrian, kennedy—what one-word vibes are you giving today and who’s on your radar
[10:48:09] Drew: drew — curious; watching parker & kennedy:

parker, you flagged my “low profile” as strategic—could you point to the exact phrasing or timing in my earlier messages that struck you as more than just friendly engagement?  

kennedy, you called out my mirroring—what exact line felt rehearsed, and what did you think i was trying to achieve by it?  

if we can get those concrete examples, we’ll have a much clearer idea whether these are real tells or just day 1 jitters—and then we can narrow down our suspect list
[10:52:25] Drew: drew—curious. we’ve lynched parker and then lost kennedy last night, and both were innocent—our calls clearly aren’t working. let’s each share one top suspect (just a name) and a one-line reason. i’ll start:

i suspect finley—they pointed at parker and kennedy, and both turned out to be bystanders, which feels too accurate to be coincidence.

adrian, you’re up—then sidney, tyler, finley
[10:52:50] Drew: drew: sidney, finley
[10:53:16] Drew: drew — finley, tyler
[10:55:49] Drew: drew: my vote’s going to tyler—i’m not buying the “quote then silence” act. tyler, if you’ve got a fresh read, drop it now; otherwise i’ll stick with this
