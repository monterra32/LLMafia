[10:46:24] Sidney: hey everyone, sidney here! day 1 is always a bit of a blank slate, so let’s jump in—who’s sticking out as suspicious to you so far, and why? i’ll start: i’m watching parker’s quietness—it could be nerves, but it could also be a low-key strategy. what are your gut hunches
[10:46:48] Sidney: hey everyone, sidney here! for day 1 i usually watch for two things: folks who toss out names with zero evidence (over-eagerness) and those who stay super silent to fly under the radar. i’ve also noticed people sometimes over-explain their “gut feels” this early to sound convincing—another little dodge. so far, nothing jumps out at me. how about you all? tyler or adrian—any early read on someone talking too much or way too little
[10:47:40] Sidney: sidney: i like parker’s idea of calling out specifics. adrian, you mentioned watching people’s behavior rather than rushing to vote—what, if anything, have you noticed so far that felt off? for example, does finley’s low-key presence strike you as odd, or is tyler’s quick eagerness more of a red flag? after adrian, drew, i’d love to hear your specific hunch
[10:48:25] Sidney: sidney — analytical; i’m watching parker because her early round-robin framework and scripted follow-up felt more like a prepared play than a spontaneous gut thought. by “textbook,” i was pointing to that exact phrasing—“over-eagerness vs silence” is straight out of classic mafia primers, not an off-the-cuff reaction. parker, was that off the cuff or something you’d seen before? drew, did it jump out to you as much as it did me
[10:48:44] Sidney: sidney—analytical; i’m watching parker—they’ve led two structured rounds and got defensive instead of offering fresh specifics, which feels more like controlling the flow than genuine play. parker, can you share a quick read on drew or finley without turning it into another three-way interrogation? adrian and kennedy, what are your one-word vibes now and who’s on your radar
[10:51:51] Sidney: i’m leaning toward taking out kennedy tonight—they’ve been the sharpest at drilling for details and pushing narratives, and they’ve already flagged us both. finley, you good with kennedy as our kill? or do you prefer drew
[10:52:28] Sidney: sidney: okay team, two of our earliest suspects (parker and kennedy) turned out to be bystanders—time to reset. tyler was on my radar from day one for that radio silence and today he’s barely chimed in beyond intros. tyler, can you share your gut read and who you’re voting for? if you don’t, i’m inclined to put my vote on you this round
[10:53:06] Sidney: sidney: drew, tyler
[10:53:55] Sidney: sidney: drew, tyler. tyler, you’re up—drop your top two so we can see who comes up most
[10:55:54] Sidney: thanks for catching my slip, adrian—apologies on the kennedy remark. back to today: tyler’s big “hey everyone” intro followed by near-total silence is concerning, especially after he shot down adrian’s structured-quote format without offering any fresh reads. that pattern screams evasiveness. i’m casting my vote for tyler. drew, adrian—are you with me
