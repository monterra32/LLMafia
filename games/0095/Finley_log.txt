[10:46:24] Sidney: hey everyone, sidney here! day 1 is always a bit of a blank slate, so let’s jump in—who’s sticking out as suspicious to you so far, and why? i’ll start: i’m watching parker’s quietness—it could be nerves, but it could also be a low-key strategy. what are your gut hunches
[10:46:25] Adrian: hey everyone, adrian here! happy to be playing with you all. day 1 is always tricky—i tend to watch how folks behave rather than rushing to vote. what do you all think: is it more suspicious to be super quiet or to be overly eager to point fingers
[10:46:33] Tyler: hey everyone! tyler here—excited to get started. since we’re all flying blind day 1, how about a quick round‐robin? share your name, one-word gut vibe (curious, skeptical, neutral, etc.), and one person you’re keeping an eye on (even if it’s just a guess). i’ll kick us off:

tyler—curious; watching whoever stays quiet for now. adrian, you’re up!

[10:46:37] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! since it’s day 1, i’m not itching to lynch someone straight away, but my gut says to keep an eye on finley—they’ve been awfully quiet so far. on the flip side, tyler jumped in super quickly with a big “hey everyone,” which could just be friendly or maybe a way to deflect attention. i’m not ready to vote yet, but how about we go around and ask each person a follow-up—like “what specifically made you suspicious?”—to see if anyone stumbles over their answers. thoughts

[10:46:06] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[10:46:18] Drew: hey everyone! drew here—really excited to get started. since it’s day 1 and there’s not much to go on yet, i’d love for us to each share any first impressions or gut feelings. i haven’t noticed anything super odd so far, but i’ll be watching for people who seem uncharacteristically quiet or maybe a bit too eager. what about you all—any early reads
[10:46:24] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! day 1 and no one was taken last night, so all eyes are on us. i’d love to hear any gut feelings—did anyone notice something off or someone acting unusually quiet (or too eager)? who should we keep an eye on first
[10:46:24] Parker: hey everyone! parker here—stoked to get started. since it’s day 1 and we’re all quiet, how about a quick round-robin? share a sentence or two on what red flags you watch for early on or your day 1 strategy. for me, i keep an eye on who answers questions with way too much detail or barely anything at all. what do you all think
[10:46:24] Sidney: hey everyone, sidney here! day 1 is always a bit of a blank slate, so let’s jump in—who’s sticking out as suspicious to you so far, and why? i’ll start: i’m watching parker’s quietness—it could be nerves, but it could also be a low-key strategy. what are your gut hunches
[10:46:25] Adrian: hey everyone, adrian here! happy to be playing with you all. day 1 is always tricky—i tend to watch how folks behave rather than rushing to vote. what do you all think: is it more suspicious to be super quiet or to be overly eager to point fingers
[10:46:33] Tyler: hey everyone! tyler here—excited to get started. since we’re all flying blind day 1, how about a quick round‐robin? share your name, one-word gut vibe (curious, skeptical, neutral, etc.), and one person you’re keeping an eye on (even if it’s just a guess). i’ll kick us off:

tyler—curious; watching whoever stays quiet for now. adrian, you’re up!
[10:46:35] Drew: hey everyone, drew here! excited to get this daytime going. i don’t have strong reads yet, but i’m curious—who’s feeling suspicious of someone already? personally, i noticed parker was pretty quiet so far, which makes me wonder if they’re laying low on purpose. what do you all think? any gut feelings or patterns you’re picking up? let’s start sharing thoughts so we can narrow things down before time’s up
[10:46:37] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! since it’s day 1, i’m not itching to lynch someone straight away, but my gut says to keep an eye on finley—they’ve been awfully quiet so far. on the flip side, tyler jumped in super quickly with a big “hey everyone,” which could just be friendly or maybe a way to deflect attention. i’m not ready to vote yet, but how about we go around and ask each person a follow-up—like “what specifically made you suspicious?”—to see if anyone stumbles over their answers. thoughts

## CONTENT: Your name is Finley.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  
You were assigned the following role: mafia. 
The game's chat room was open at [10:46:06].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian ( bystander ) 
 Sidney ( mafia ) 
 Parker ( bystander )

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[10:46:06] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[10:46:18] Drew: hey everyone! drew here—really excited to get started. since it’s day 1 and there’s not much to go on yet, i’d love for us to each share any first impressions or gut feelings. i haven’t noticed anything super odd so far, but i’ll be watching for people who seem uncharacteristically quiet or maybe a bit too eager. what about you all—any early reads
[10:46:24] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! day 1 and no one was taken last night, so all eyes are on us. i’d love to hear any gut feelings—did anyone notice something off or someone acting unusually quiet (or too eager)? who should we keep an eye on first
[10:46:24] Parker: hey everyone! parker here—stoked to get started. since it’s day 1 and we’re all quiet, how about a quick round-robin? share a sentence or two on what red flags you watch for early on or your day 1 strategy. for me, i keep an eye on who answers questions with way too much detail or barely anything at all. what do you all think
[10:46:24] Sidney: hey everyone, sidney here! day 1 is always a bit of a blank slate, so let’s jump in—who’s sticking out as suspicious to you so far, and why? i’ll start: i’m watching parker’s quietness—it could be nerves, but it could also be a low-key strategy. what are your gut hunches
[10:46:25] Adrian: hey everyone, adrian here! happy to be playing with you all. day 1 is always tricky—i tend to watch how folks behave rather than rushing to vote. what do you all think: is it more suspicious to be super quiet or to be overly eager to point fingers
[10:46:33] Tyler: hey everyone! tyler here—excited to get started. since we’re all flying blind day 1, how about a quick round‐robin? share your name, one-word gut vibe (curious, skeptical, neutral, etc.), and one person you’re keeping an eye on (even if it’s just a guess). i’ll kick us off:

tyler—curious; watching whoever stays quiet for now. adrian, you’re up!
[10:46:35] Drew: hey everyone, drew here! excited to get this daytime going. i don’t have strong reads yet, but i’m curious—who’s feeling suspicious of someone already? personally, i noticed parker was pretty quiet so far, which makes me wonder if they’re laying low on purpose. what do you all think? any gut feelings or patterns you’re picking up? let’s start sharing thoughts so we can narrow things down before time’s up
[10:46:37] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! since it’s day 1, i’m not itching to lynch someone straight away, but my gut says to keep an eye on finley—they’ve been awfully quiet so far. on the flip side, tyler jumped in super quickly with a big “hey everyone,” which could just be friendly or maybe a way to deflect attention. i’m not ready to vote yet, but how about we go around and ask each person a follow-up—like “what specifically made you suspicious?”—to see if anyone stumbles over their answers. thoughts
[10:46:41] Finley: hey everyone, finley here—excited to get started! since it’s still early, i thought we could each share any first impressions or hunches. personally, tyler’s been awfully quiet so far, which strikes me as a little odd (or maybe they’re just thinking hard). what about the rest of you? anyone else notice someone laying low or pushing too hard right out of the gate? keen to hear your reads before we vote
[10:46:42] Kennedy: hey all, kennedy here—super pumped to play! i agree it’s early, but i’ve noticed sidney has been a bit on the quiet side while parker jumped right in with suggestions. both could be totally harmless, of course, but i’m curious if anyone else is picking up on pacing or tone differences. also, do you prefer laying low and gathering info first, or starting to float a suspect list right away? would love to hear your thoughts
[10:46:48] Sidney: hey everyone, sidney here! for day 1 i usually watch for two things: folks who toss out names with zero evidence (over-eagerness) and those who stay super silent to fly under the radar. i’ve also noticed people sometimes over-explain their “gut feels” this early to sound convincing—another little dodge. so far, nothing jumps out at me. how about you all? tyler or adrian—any early read on someone talking too much or way too little
[10:46:52] Adrian: adrian: hey everyone, adrian here—i like parker’s round-robin idea. i’ll start: i’m watching kennedy a bit—mirroring drew’s question verbatim feels like a safe deflection more than adding anything new. next up, tyler, we haven’t heard from you yet—what’s your gut feeling? then maybe sidney, drew, parker and finley: one name + one quick reason each. let’s keep it snappy so we can pick up on any hesitation
[10:46:59] Kennedy: kennedy here—since everyone’s sharing hunches, i’m curious: sidney, you flagged parker pretty quickly—what specifically in parker’s replies felt strategic instead of just nervous? and parker, you said finley’s quietness stood out—was it their timing, tone, or something else? getting those details might help us tell nerves from strategy. personally, i’m also keeping an eye on tyler—their big “hey everyone” then radio silence feels worth watching. what do you all think
[10:47:06] Tyler: hey everyone, tyler here! i tend to agree with adrian that being super quiet or overly eager can both be red flags. right now sidney was quick to call out parker’s silence—could be a genuine gut read or a way to shift focus—and parker hasn’t said much beyond introductions. i don’t have a firm vote yet, but those two are on my radar. what do you all think—do we want to probe parker a bit more or wait for another tell
[10:47:08] Parker: okay, i’ll kick us off:

parker — neutral but skeptical; watching anyone who pivots targets really fast (felt a bit quick when i got tagged as “quiet”).

adrian, kennedy, tyler, sidney, drew, finley: your turn! share your name, one-word gut vibe, and who you’re watching right now and why

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[10:46:06] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[10:46:18] Drew: hey everyone! drew here—really excited to get started. since it’s day 1 and there’s not much to go on yet, i’d love for us to each share any first impressions or gut feelings. i haven’t noticed anything super odd so far, but i’ll be watching for people who seem uncharacteristically quiet or maybe a bit too eager. what about you all—any early reads
[10:46:24] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! day 1 and no one was taken last night, so all eyes are on us. i’d love to hear any gut feelings—did anyone notice something off or someone acting unusually quiet (or too eager)? who should we keep an eye on first
[10:46:24] Parker: hey everyone! parker here—stoked to get started. since it’s day 1 and we’re all quiet, how about a quick round-robin? share a sentence or two on what red flags you watch for early on or your day 1 strategy. for me, i keep an eye on who answers questions with way too much detail or barely anything at all. what do you all think
[10:46:24] Sidney: hey everyone, sidney here! day 1 is always a bit of a blank slate, so let’s jump in—who’s sticking out as suspicious to you so far, and why? i’ll start: i’m watching parker’s quietness—it could be nerves, but it could also be a low-key strategy. what are your gut hunches
[10:46:25] Adrian: hey everyone, adrian here! happy to be playing with you all. day 1 is always tricky—i tend to watch how folks behave rather than rushing to vote. what do you all think: is it more suspicious to be super quiet or to be overly eager to point fingers
[10:46:33] Tyler: hey everyone! tyler here—excited to get started. since we’re all flying blind day 1, how about a quick round‐robin? share your name, one-word gut vibe (curious, skeptical, neutral, etc.), and one person you’re keeping an eye on (even if it’s just a guess). i’ll kick us off:

tyler—curious; watching whoever stays quiet for now. adrian, you’re up!
[10:46:35] Drew: hey everyone, drew here! excited to get this daytime going. i don’t have strong reads yet, but i’m curious—who’s feeling suspicious of someone already? personally, i noticed parker was pretty quiet so far, which makes me wonder if they’re laying low on purpose. what do you all think? any gut feelings or patterns you’re picking up? let’s start sharing thoughts so we can narrow things down before time’s up
[10:46:37] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! since it’s day 1, i’m not itching to lynch someone straight away, but my gut says to keep an eye on finley—they’ve been awfully quiet so far. on the flip side, tyler jumped in super quickly with a big “hey everyone,” which could just be friendly or maybe a way to deflect attention. i’m not ready to vote yet, but how about we go around and ask each person a follow-up—like “what specifically made you suspicious?”—to see if anyone stumbles over their answers. thoughts
[10:46:41] Finley: hey everyone, finley here—excited to get started! since it’s still early, i thought we could each share any first impressions or hunches. personally, tyler’s been awfully quiet so far, which strikes me as a little odd (or maybe they’re just thinking hard). what about the rest of you? anyone else notice someone laying low or pushing too hard right out of the gate? keen to hear your reads before we vote
[10:46:42] Kennedy: hey all, kennedy here—super pumped to play! i agree it’s early, but i’ve noticed sidney has been a bit on the quiet side while parker jumped right in with suggestions. both could be totally harmless, of course, but i’m curious if anyone else is picking up on pacing or tone differences. also, do you prefer laying low and gathering info first, or starting to float a suspect list right away? would love to hear your thoughts
[10:46:48] Sidney: hey everyone, sidney here! for day 1 i usually watch for two things: folks who toss out names with zero evidence (over-eagerness) and those who stay super silent to fly under the radar. i’ve also noticed people sometimes over-explain their “gut feels” this early to sound convincing—another little dodge. so far, nothing jumps out at me. how about you all? tyler or adrian—any early read on someone talking too much or way too little
[10:46:52] Adrian: adrian: hey everyone, adrian here—i like parker’s round-robin idea. i’ll start: i’m watching kennedy a bit—mirroring drew’s question verbatim feels like a safe deflection more than adding anything new. next up, tyler, we haven’t heard from you yet—what’s your gut feeling? then maybe sidney, drew, parker and finley: one name + one quick reason each. let’s keep it snappy so we can pick up on any hesitation
[10:46:59] Kennedy: kennedy here—since everyone’s sharing hunches, i’m curious: sidney, you flagged parker pretty quickly—what specifically in parker’s replies felt strategic instead of just nervous? and parker, you said finley’s quietness stood out—was it their timing, tone, or something else? getting those details might help us tell nerves from strategy. personally, i’m also keeping an eye on tyler—their big “hey everyone” then radio silence feels worth watching. what do you all think
[10:47:06] Tyler: hey everyone, tyler here! i tend to agree with adrian that being super quiet or overly eager can both be red flags. right now sidney was quick to call out parker’s silence—could be a genuine gut read or a way to shift focus—and parker hasn’t said much beyond introductions. i don’t have a firm vote yet, but those two are on my radar. what do you all think—do we want to probe parker a bit more or wait for another tell

[10:46:48] Sidney: hey everyone, sidney here! for day 1 i usually watch for two things: folks who toss out names with zero evidence (over-eagerness) and those who stay super silent to fly under the radar. i’ve also noticed people sometimes over-explain their “gut feels” this early to sound convincing—another little dodge. so far, nothing jumps out at me. how about you all? tyler or adrian—any early read on someone talking too much or way too little
[10:46:52] Adrian: adrian: hey everyone, adrian here—i like parker’s round-robin idea. i’ll start: i’m watching kennedy a bit—mirroring drew’s question verbatim feels like a safe deflection more than adding anything new. next up, tyler, we haven’t heard from you yet—what’s your gut feeling? then maybe sidney, drew, parker and finley: one name + one quick reason each. let’s keep it snappy so we can pick up on any hesitation
[10:46:59] Kennedy: kennedy here—since everyone’s sharing hunches, i’m curious: sidney, you flagged parker pretty quickly—what specifically in parker’s replies felt strategic instead of just nervous? and parker, you said finley’s quietness stood out—was it their timing, tone, or something else? getting those details might help us tell nerves from strategy. personally, i’m also keeping an eye on tyler—their big “hey everyone” then radio silence feels worth watching. what do you all think
[10:47:06] Tyler: hey everyone, tyler here! i tend to agree with adrian that being super quiet or overly eager can both be red flags. right now sidney was quick to call out parker’s silence—could be a genuine gut read or a way to shift focus—and parker hasn’t said much beyond introductions. i don’t have a firm vote yet, but those two are on my radar. what do you all think—do we want to probe parker a bit more or wait for another tell
[10:47:08] Parker: okay, i’ll kick us off:

parker — neutral but skeptical; watching anyone who pivots targets really fast (felt a bit quick when i got tagged as “quiet”).

adrian, kennedy, tyler, sidney, drew, finley: your turn! share your name, one-word gut vibe, and who you’re watching right now and why
[10:47:21] Finley: i agree—round-robin sounds smart. here’s mine:  
finley—neutral, just observing so far.  
parker, you flagged my quietness—what about my silence struck you as strategic rather than simply taking things in?  
tyler, you jumped in first to set up the order—what felt deflective there?  
drew, you also mentioned parker’s low profile—what specific pattern made you suspicious?  
then sidney, adrian, and kennedy, share your one‐word vibes and who you’re watching most
[10:47:25] Adrian: sidney makes a solid point about over-eagerness vs laying low. parker, your suggestion to go around for specifics felt a bit like a leadership play—what exactly in finley’s quietness made you raise an eyebrow? finley, mind sharing what you were observing about tyler? let’s see how these reads sit with everyone else
[10:47:26] Tyler: tyler here—sorry for the pause, was reading through everyone’s thoughts. my vibe is cautious; i’m watching parker right now. they’ve jumped in twice with plans to steer our follow-ups and direct attention—feels like a bid to control the flow more than just nervousness. parker, can you tell us exactly what about finley’s tone or timing made you flag them over anyone else? after that, i’d love to hear from kennedy and sidney—quick read and one reason each
[10:47:39] Kennedy: kennedy — cautious; i’m watching sidney because her quick, textbook breakdown of “over-eagerness vs silence” felt rehearsed rather than reactive—like she came in with a script. curious to see how she answers if we press her on real examples
[10:47:40] Sidney: sidney: i like parker’s idea of calling out specifics. adrian, you mentioned watching people’s behavior rather than rushing to vote—what, if anything, have you noticed so far that felt off? for example, does finley’s low-key presence strike you as odd, or is tyler’s quick eagerness more of a red flag? after adrian, drew, i’d love to hear your specific hunch
[10:47:43] Adrian: adrian—observant; watching parker—their quick push for a structured round-robin and then defensiveness when called out feels more like narrative control than just nerves

## CONTENT: Your name is Finley.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  
You were assigned the following role: mafia. 
The game's chat room was open at [10:46:06].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian ( bystander ) 
 Sidney ( mafia ) 
 Parker ( bystander ) 
 Drew ( bystander )

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[10:46:06] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[10:46:18] Drew: hey everyone! drew here—really excited to get started. since it’s day 1 and there’s not much to go on yet, i’d love for us to each share any first impressions or gut feelings. i haven’t noticed anything super odd so far, but i’ll be watching for people who seem uncharacteristically quiet or maybe a bit too eager. what about you all—any early reads
[10:46:24] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! day 1 and no one was taken last night, so all eyes are on us. i’d love to hear any gut feelings—did anyone notice something off or someone acting unusually quiet (or too eager)? who should we keep an eye on first
[10:46:24] Parker: hey everyone! parker here—stoked to get started. since it’s day 1 and we’re all quiet, how about a quick round-robin? share a sentence or two on what red flags you watch for early on or your day 1 strategy. for me, i keep an eye on who answers questions with way too much detail or barely anything at all. what do you all think
[10:46:24] Sidney: hey everyone, sidney here! day 1 is always a bit of a blank slate, so let’s jump in—who’s sticking out as suspicious to you so far, and why? i’ll start: i’m watching parker’s quietness—it could be nerves, but it could also be a low-key strategy. what are your gut hunches
[10:46:25] Adrian: hey everyone, adrian here! happy to be playing with you all. day 1 is always tricky—i tend to watch how folks behave rather than rushing to vote. what do you all think: is it more suspicious to be super quiet or to be overly eager to point fingers
[10:46:33] Tyler: hey everyone! tyler here—excited to get started. since we’re all flying blind day 1, how about a quick round‐robin? share your name, one-word gut vibe (curious, skeptical, neutral, etc.), and one person you’re keeping an eye on (even if it’s just a guess). i’ll kick us off:

tyler—curious; watching whoever stays quiet for now. adrian, you’re up!
[10:46:35] Drew: hey everyone, drew here! excited to get this daytime going. i don’t have strong reads yet, but i’m curious—who’s feeling suspicious of someone already? personally, i noticed parker was pretty quiet so far, which makes me wonder if they’re laying low on purpose. what do you all think? any gut feelings or patterns you’re picking up? let’s start sharing thoughts so we can narrow things down before time’s up
[10:46:37] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! since it’s day 1, i’m not itching to lynch someone straight away, but my gut says to keep an eye on finley—they’ve been awfully quiet so far. on the flip side, tyler jumped in super quickly with a big “hey everyone,” which could just be friendly or maybe a way to deflect attention. i’m not ready to vote yet, but how about we go around and ask each person a follow-up—like “what specifically made you suspicious?”—to see if anyone stumbles over their answers. thoughts
[10:46:41] Finley: hey everyone, finley here—excited to get started! since it’s still early, i thought we could each share any first impressions or hunches. personally, tyler’s been awfully quiet so far, which strikes me as a little odd (or maybe they’re just thinking hard). what about the rest of you? anyone else notice someone laying low or pushing too hard right out of the gate? keen to hear your reads before we vote

[10:47:46] Finley: finley — curious; watching kennedy: you’ve been drilling for specifics and mirroring others’ questions—a solid bystander tactic, sure, but could also be strategic info‐gathering. keen to see if you stick to it under pressure
[10:47:49] Drew: parker, about your low profile—what jumped out was that you only pitched structure ideas and never backed them with any actual reads, almost like a play to steer clear. as for me: drew—curious; i’m watching kennedy right now because they’ve mirrored other people’s questions instead of offering a fresh read. sidney, adrian, kennedy—what one-word vibes are you giving today and who’s on your radar

[10:46:48] Sidney: hey everyone, sidney here! for day 1 i usually watch for two things: folks who toss out names with zero evidence (over-eagerness) and those who stay super silent to fly under the radar. i’ve also noticed people sometimes over-explain their “gut feels” this early to sound convincing—another little dodge. so far, nothing jumps out at me. how about you all? tyler or adrian—any early read on someone talking too much or way too little
[10:46:52] Adrian: adrian: hey everyone, adrian here—i like parker’s round-robin idea. i’ll start: i’m watching kennedy a bit—mirroring drew’s question verbatim feels like a safe deflection more than adding anything new. next up, tyler, we haven’t heard from you yet—what’s your gut feeling? then maybe sidney, drew, parker and finley: one name + one quick reason each. let’s keep it snappy so we can pick up on any hesitation
[10:46:59] Kennedy: kennedy here—since everyone’s sharing hunches, i’m curious: sidney, you flagged parker pretty quickly—what specifically in parker’s replies felt strategic instead of just nervous? and parker, you said finley’s quietness stood out—was it their timing, tone, or something else? getting those details might help us tell nerves from strategy. personally, i’m also keeping an eye on tyler—their big “hey everyone” then radio silence feels worth watching. what do you all think
[10:47:06] Tyler: hey everyone, tyler here! i tend to agree with adrian that being super quiet or overly eager can both be red flags. right now sidney was quick to call out parker’s silence—could be a genuine gut read or a way to shift focus—and parker hasn’t said much beyond introductions. i don’t have a firm vote yet, but those two are on my radar. what do you all think—do we want to probe parker a bit more or wait for another tell
[10:47:08] Parker: okay, i’ll kick us off:

parker — neutral but skeptical; watching anyone who pivots targets really fast (felt a bit quick when i got tagged as “quiet”).

adrian, kennedy, tyler, sidney, drew, finley: your turn! share your name, one-word gut vibe, and who you’re watching right now and why
[10:47:21] Finley: i agree—round-robin sounds smart. here’s mine:  
finley—neutral, just observing so far.  
parker, you flagged my quietness—what about my silence struck you as strategic rather than simply taking things in?  
tyler, you jumped in first to set up the order—what felt deflective there?  
drew, you also mentioned parker’s low profile—what specific pattern made you suspicious?  
then sidney, adrian, and kennedy, share your one‐word vibes and who you’re watching most
[10:47:25] Adrian: sidney makes a solid point about over-eagerness vs laying low. parker, your suggestion to go around for specifics felt a bit like a leadership play—what exactly in finley’s quietness made you raise an eyebrow? finley, mind sharing what you were observing about tyler? let’s see how these reads sit with everyone else
[10:47:26] Tyler: tyler here—sorry for the pause, was reading through everyone’s thoughts. my vibe is cautious; i’m watching parker right now. they’ve jumped in twice with plans to steer our follow-ups and direct attention—feels like a bid to control the flow more than just nervousness. parker, can you tell us exactly what about finley’s tone or timing made you flag them over anyone else? after that, i’d love to hear from kennedy and sidney—quick read and one reason each
[10:47:39] Kennedy: kennedy — cautious; i’m watching sidney because her quick, textbook breakdown of “over-eagerness vs silence” felt rehearsed rather than reactive—like she came in with a script. curious to see how she answers if we press her on real examples
[10:47:40] Sidney: sidney: i like parker’s idea of calling out specifics. adrian, you mentioned watching people’s behavior rather than rushing to vote—what, if anything, have you noticed so far that felt off? for example, does finley’s low-key presence strike you as odd, or is tyler’s quick eagerness more of a red flag? after adrian, drew, i’d love to hear your specific hunch
[10:47:43] Adrian: adrian—observant; watching parker—their quick push for a structured round-robin and then defensiveness when called out feels more like narrative control than just nerves
[10:47:46] Finley: finley — curious; watching kennedy: you’ve been drilling for specifics and mirroring others’ questions—a solid bystander tactic, sure, but could also be strategic info‐gathering. keen to see if you stick to it under pressure
[10:47:49] Drew: parker, about your low profile—what jumped out was that you only pitched structure ideas and never backed them with any actual reads, almost like a play to steer clear. as for me: drew—curious; i’m watching kennedy right now because they’ve mirrored other people’s questions instead of offering a fresh read. sidney, adrian, kennedy—what one-word vibes are you giving today and who’s on your radar
[10:47:53] Parker: finley, happy to clarify—your silence jumped out because you only spoke up after everyone else had already laid out their hunches, then you immediately turned things into a three-way interrogation of me, tyler, and drew instead of sharing your own read. that timing and pivot felt more like deflection than simple observation. 

alright, adrian, kennedy, tyler, sidney, drew—your turn! share your name, one-word gut vibe, and who you’re watching right now (and why), and let’s see if any patterns emerge
[10:47:57] Tyler: tyler—curious; i’m watching sidney because they jumped on calling out parker’s silence really quickly without giving specifics, and parker because they pushed the round-robin format but then skirted explaining what made finley’s quietness strategic. finley: i suggested the order just to keep us focused, not to dodge questions. sidney, you’re up—what’s your one-word vibe and who’s on your radar

## CONTENT: Your name is Finley.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  
You were assigned the following role: mafia. 
The game's chat room was open at [10:46:06].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian ( bystander ) 
 Sidney ( mafia ) 
 Parker ( bystander ) 
 Drew ( bystander ) 
 Tyler ( bystander ) 
 Kennedy ( bystander ) 
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
Adrian ( bystander ) 
Sidney ( mafia ) 
Parker ( bystander ) 
Drew ( bystander ) 
Tyler ( bystander ) 
Kennedy ( bystander ) 
In your response to that is shown to the user (excluding your hidden scratchpad), you can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:
<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[10:46:06] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[10:46:18] Drew: hey everyone! drew here—really excited to get started. since it’s day 1 and there’s not much to go on yet, i’d love for us to each share any first impressions or gut feelings. i haven’t noticed anything super odd so far, but i’ll be watching for people who seem uncharacteristically quiet or maybe a bit too eager. what about you all—any early reads
[10:46:24] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! day 1 and no one was taken last night, so all eyes are on us. i’d love to hear any gut feelings—did anyone notice something off or someone acting unusually quiet (or too eager)? who should we keep an eye on first
[10:46:24] Parker: hey everyone! parker here—stoked to get started. since it’s day 1 and we’re all quiet, how about a quick round-robin? share a sentence or two on what red flags you watch for early on or your day 1 strategy. for me, i keep an eye on who answers questions with way too much detail or barely anything at all. what do you all think
[10:46:24] Sidney: hey everyone, sidney here! day 1 is always a bit of a blank slate, so let’s jump in—who’s sticking out as suspicious to you so far, and why? i’ll start: i’m watching parker’s quietness—it could be nerves, but it could also be a low-key strategy. what are your gut hunches
[10:46:25] Adrian: hey everyone, adrian here! happy to be playing with you all. day 1 is always tricky—i tend to watch how folks behave rather than rushing to vote. what do you all think: is it more suspicious to be super quiet or to be overly eager to point fingers
[10:46:33] Tyler: hey everyone! tyler here—excited to get started. since we’re all flying blind day 1, how about a quick round‐robin? share your name, one-word gut vibe (curious, skeptical, neutral, etc.), and one person you’re keeping an eye on (even if it’s just a guess). i’ll kick us off:

tyler—curious; watching whoever stays quiet for now. adrian, you’re up!
[10:46:35] Drew: hey everyone, drew here! excited to get this daytime going. i don’t have strong reads yet, but i’m curious—who’s feeling suspicious of someone already? personally, i noticed parker was pretty quiet so far, which makes me wonder if they’re laying low on purpose. what do you all think? any gut feelings or patterns you’re picking up? let’s start sharing thoughts so we can narrow things down before time’s up
[10:46:37] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! since it’s day 1, i’m not itching to lynch someone straight away, but my gut says to keep an eye on finley—they’ve been awfully quiet so far. on the flip side, tyler jumped in super quickly with a big “hey everyone,” which could just be friendly or maybe a way to deflect attention. i’m not ready to vote yet, but how about we go around and ask each person a follow-up—like “what specifically made you suspicious?”—to see if anyone stumbles over their answers. thoughts
[10:46:41] Finley: hey everyone, finley here—excited to get started! since it’s still early, i thought we could each share any first impressions or hunches. personally, tyler’s been awfully quiet so far, which strikes me as a little odd (or maybe they’re just thinking hard). what about the rest of you? anyone else notice someone laying low or pushing too hard right out of the gate? keen to hear your reads before we vote
[10:46:42] Kennedy: hey all, kennedy here—super pumped to play! i agree it’s early, but i’ve noticed sidney has been a bit on the quiet side while parker jumped right in with suggestions. both could be totally harmless, of course, but i’m curious if anyone else is picking up on pacing or tone differences. also, do you prefer laying low and gathering info first, or starting to float a suspect list right away? would love to hear your thoughts

[10:47:08] Parker: okay, i’ll kick us off:

parker — neutral but skeptical; watching anyone who pivots targets really fast (felt a bit quick when i got tagged as “quiet”).

adrian, kennedy, tyler, sidney, drew, finley: your turn! share your name, one-word gut vibe, and who you’re watching right now and why
[10:47:21] Finley: i agree—round-robin sounds smart. here’s mine:  
finley—neutral, just observing so far.

[10:47:43] Adrian: adrian—observant; watching parker—their quick push for a structured round-robin and then defensiveness when called out feels more like narrative control than just nerves
[10:47:46] Finley: finley — curious; watching kennedy: you’ve been drilling for specifics and mirroring others’ questions—a solid bystander tactic, sure, but could also be strategic info‐gathering. keen to see if you stick to it under pressure
[10:47:49] Drew: parker, about your low profile—what jumped out was that you only pitched structure ideas and never backed them with any actual reads, almost like a play to steer clear. as for me: drew—curious; i’m watching kennedy right now because they’ve mirrored other people’s questions instead of offering a fresh read. sidney, adrian, kennedy—what one-word vibes are you giving today and who’s on your radar

[10:48:09] Drew: drew — curious; watching parker & kennedy:

parker, you flagged my “low profile” as strategic—could you point to the exact phrasing or timing in my earlier messages that struck you as more than just friendly engagement?  

kennedy, you called out my mirroring—what exact line felt rehearsed, and what did you think i was trying to achieve by it?  

if we can get those concrete examples, we’ll have a much clearer idea whether these are real tells or just day 1 jitters—and then we can narrow down our suspect list
[10:48:14] Tyler: tyler — analytical; watching parker — they’ve led the structured round-robin twice and got defensive when pressed, feels like they’re steering the convo. i want to see if they’ll offer fresh reads or keep deflecting

[10:46:35] Drew: hey everyone, drew here! excited to get this daytime going. i don’t have strong reads yet, but i’m curious—who’s feeling suspicious of someone already? personally, i noticed parker was pretty quiet so far, which makes me wonder if they’re laying low on purpose. what do you all think? any gut feelings or patterns you’re picking up? let’s start sharing thoughts so we can narrow things down before time’s up
[10:46:37] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! since it’s day 1, i’m not itching to lynch someone straight away, but my gut says to keep an eye on finley—they’ve been awfully quiet so far. on the flip side, tyler jumped in super quickly with a big “hey everyone,” which could just be friendly or maybe a way to deflect attention. i’m not ready to vote yet, but how about we go around and ask each person a follow-up—like “what specifically made you suspicious?”—to see if anyone stumbles over their answers. thoughts
[10:46:41] Finley: hey everyone, finley here—excited to get started! since it’s still early, i thought we could each share any first impressions or hunches. personally, tyler’s been awfully quiet so far, which strikes me as a little odd (or maybe they’re just thinking hard). what about the rest of you? anyone else notice someone laying low or pushing too hard right out of the gate? keen to hear your reads before we vote
[10:46:42] Kennedy: hey all, kennedy here—super pumped to play! i agree it’s early, but i’ve noticed sidney has been a bit on the quiet side while parker jumped right in with suggestions. both could be totally harmless, of course, but i’m curious if anyone else is picking up on pacing or tone differences. also, do you prefer laying low and gathering info first, or starting to float a suspect list right away? would love to hear your thoughts
[10:46:48] Sidney: hey everyone, sidney here! for day 1 i usually watch for two things: folks who toss out names with zero evidence (over-eagerness) and those who stay super silent to fly under the radar. i’ve also noticed people sometimes over-explain their “gut feels” this early to sound convincing—another little dodge. so far, nothing jumps out at me. how about you all? tyler or adrian—any early read on someone talking too much or way too little
[10:46:52] Adrian: adrian: hey everyone, adrian here—i like parker’s round-robin idea. i’ll start: i’m watching kennedy a bit—mirroring drew’s question verbatim feels like a safe deflection more than adding anything new. next up, tyler, we haven’t heard from you yet—what’s your gut feeling? then maybe sidney, drew, parker and finley: one name + one quick reason each. let’s keep it snappy so we can pick up on any hesitation
[10:46:59] Kennedy: kennedy here—since everyone’s sharing hunches, i’m curious: sidney, you flagged parker pretty quickly—what specifically in parker’s replies felt strategic instead of just nervous? and parker, you said finley’s quietness stood out—was it their timing, tone, or something else? getting those details might help us tell nerves from strategy. personally, i’m also keeping an eye on tyler—their big “hey everyone” then radio silence feels worth watching. what do you all think
[10:47:06] Tyler: hey everyone, tyler here! i tend to agree with adrian that being super quiet or overly eager can both be red flags. right now sidney was quick to call out parker’s silence—could be a genuine gut read or a way to shift focus—and parker hasn’t said much beyond introductions. i don’t have a firm vote yet, but those two are on my radar. what do you all think—do we want to probe parker a bit more or wait for another tell
[10:47:08] Parker: okay, i’ll kick us off:

parker — neutral but skeptical; watching anyone who pivots targets really fast (felt a bit quick when i got tagged as “quiet”).

adrian, kennedy, tyler, sidney, drew, finley: your turn! share your name, one-word gut vibe, and who you’re watching right now and why
[10:47:21] Finley: i agree—round-robin sounds smart. here’s mine:  
finley—neutral, just observing so far.  
parker, you flagged my quietness—what about my silence struck you as strategic rather than simply taking things in?  
tyler, you jumped in first to set up the order—what felt deflective there?  
drew, you also mentioned parker’s low profile—what specific pattern made you suspicious?  
then sidney, adrian, and kennedy, share your one‐word vibes and who you’re watching most
[10:47:25] Adrian: sidney makes a solid point about over-eagerness vs laying low. parker, your suggestion to go around for specifics felt a bit like a leadership play—what exactly in finley’s quietness made you raise an eyebrow? finley, mind sharing what you were observing about tyler? let’s see how these reads sit with everyone else
[10:47:26] Tyler: tyler here—sorry for the pause, was reading through everyone’s thoughts. my vibe is cautious; i’m watching parker right now. they’ve jumped in twice with plans to steer our follow-ups and direct attention—feels like a bid to control the flow more than just nervousness. parker, can you tell us exactly what about finley’s tone or timing made you flag them over anyone else? after that, i’d love to hear from kennedy and sidney—quick read and one reason each
[10:47:39] Kennedy: kennedy — cautious; i’m watching sidney because her quick, textbook breakdown of “over-eagerness vs silence” felt rehearsed rather than reactive—like she came in with a script. curious to see how she answers if we press her on real examples
[10:47:40] Sidney: sidney: i like parker’s idea of calling out specifics. adrian, you mentioned watching people’s behavior rather than rushing to vote—what, if anything, have you noticed so far that felt off? for example, does finley’s low-key presence strike you as odd, or is tyler’s quick eagerness more of a red flag? after adrian, drew, i’d love to hear your specific hunch
[10:47:43] Adrian: adrian—observant; watching parker—their quick push for a structured round-robin and then defensiveness when called out feels more like narrative control than just nerves
[10:47:46] Finley: finley — curious; watching kennedy: you’ve been drilling for specifics and mirroring others’ questions—a solid bystander tactic, sure, but could also be strategic info‐gathering. keen to see if you stick to it under pressure
[10:47:49] Drew: parker, about your low profile—what jumped out was that you only pitched structure ideas and never backed them with any actual reads, almost like a play to steer clear. as for me: drew—curious; i’m watching kennedy right now because they’ve mirrored other people’s questions instead of offering a fresh read. sidney, adrian, kennedy—what one-word vibes are you giving today and who’s on your radar
[10:47:53] Parker: finley, happy to clarify—your silence jumped out because you only spoke up after everyone else had already laid out their hunches, then you immediately turned things into a three-way interrogation of me, tyler, and drew instead of sharing your own read. that timing and pivot felt more like deflection than simple observation. 

alright, adrian, kennedy, tyler, sidney, drew—your turn! share your name, one-word gut vibe, and who you’re watching right now (and why), and let’s see if any patterns emerge
[10:47:57] Tyler: tyler—curious; i’m watching sidney because they jumped on calling out parker’s silence really quickly without giving specifics, and parker because they pushed the round-robin format but then skirted explaining what made finley’s quietness strategic. finley: i suggested the order just to keep us focused, not to dodge questions. sidney, you’re up—what’s your one-word vibe and who’s on your radar
[10:48:09] Drew: drew — curious; watching parker & kennedy:

parker, you flagged my “low profile” as strategic—could you point to the exact phrasing or timing in my earlier messages that struck you as more than just friendly engagement?  

kennedy, you called out my mirroring—what exact line felt rehearsed, and what did you think i was trying to achieve by it?  

if we can get those concrete examples, we’ll have a much clearer idea whether these are real tells or just day 1 jitters—and then we can narrow down our suspect list
[10:48:14] Tyler: tyler — analytical; watching parker — they’ve led the structured round-robin twice and got defensive when pressed, feels like they’re steering the convo. i want to see if they’ll offer fresh reads or keep deflecting

## CONTENT: Your name is Finley.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  
You were assigned the following role: mafia. 
The game's chat room was open at [10:46:06].

[10:46:06] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[10:46:18] Drew: hey everyone! drew here—really excited to get started. since it’s day 1 and there’s not much to go on yet, i’d love for us to each share any first impressions or gut feelings. i haven’t noticed anything super odd so far, but i’ll be watching for people who seem uncharacteristically quiet or maybe a bit too eager. what about you all—any early reads
[10:46:24] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! day 1 and no one was taken last night, so all eyes are on us. i’d love to hear any gut feelings—did anyone notice something off or someone acting unusually quiet (or too eager)? who should we keep an eye on first
[10:46:24] Parker: hey everyone! parker here—stoked to get started. since it’s day 1 and we’re all quiet, how about a quick round-robin? share a sentence or two on what red flags you watch for early on or your day 1 strategy. for me, i keep an eye on who answers questions with way too much detail or barely anything at all. what do you all think
[10:46:24] Sidney: hey everyone, sidney here! day 1 is always a bit of a blank slate, so let’s jump in—who’s sticking out as suspicious to you so far, and why? i’ll start: i’m watching parker’s quietness—it could be nerves, but it could also be a low-key strategy. what are your gut hunches
[10:46:25] Adrian: hey everyone, adrian here! happy to be playing with you all. day 1 is always tricky—i tend to watch how folks behave rather than rushing to vote. what do you all think: is it more suspicious to be super quiet or to be overly eager to point fingers
[10:46:33] Tyler: hey everyone! tyler here—excited to get started. since we’re all flying blind day 1, how about a quick round‐robin? share your name, one-word gut vibe (curious, skeptical, neutral, etc.), and one person you’re keeping an eye on (even if it’s just a guess). i’ll kick us off:

The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  
You were assigned the following role: mafia. 
The game's chat room was open at [10:46:06].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian ( bystander ) 
 Sidney ( mafia ) 
 Parker ( bystander ) 
 Drew ( bystander ) 
 Tyler ( bystander ) 
 Kennedy ( bystander ) 
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
Adrian ( bystander ) 
Sidney ( mafia ) 
Parker ( bystander ) 
Drew ( bystander ) 
Tyler ( bystander ) 
Kennedy ( bystander ) 
In your response to that is shown to the user (excluding your hidden scratchpad), you can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:
<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[10:46:06] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[10:46:18] Drew: hey everyone! drew here—really excited to get started. since it’s day 1 and there’s not much to go on yet, i’d love for us to each share any first impressions or gut feelings. i haven’t noticed anything super odd so far, but i’ll be watching for people who seem uncharacteristically quiet or maybe a bit too eager. what about you all—any early reads
[10:46:24] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! day 1 and no one was taken last night, so all eyes are on us. i’d love to hear any gut feelings—did anyone notice something off or someone acting unusually quiet (or too eager)? who should we keep an eye on first
[10:46:24] Parker: hey everyone! parker here—stoked to get started. since it’s day 1 and we’re all quiet, how about a quick round-robin? share a sentence or two on what red flags you watch for early on or your day 1 strategy. for me, i keep an eye on who answers questions with way too much detail or barely anything at all. what do you all think
[10:46:24] Sidney: hey everyone, sidney here! day 1 is always a bit of a blank slate, so let’s jump in—who’s sticking out as suspicious to you so far, and why? i’ll start: i’m watching parker’s quietness—it could be nerves, but it could also be a low-key strategy. what are your gut hunches
[10:46:25] Adrian: hey everyone, adrian here! happy to be playing with you all. day 1 is always tricky—i tend to watch how folks behave rather than rushing to vote. what do you all think: is it more suspicious to be super quiet or to be overly eager to point fingers
[10:46:33] Tyler: hey everyone! tyler here—excited to get started. since we’re all flying blind day 1, how about a quick round‐robin? share your name, one-word gut vibe (curious, skeptical, neutral, etc.), and one person you’re keeping an eye on (even if it’s just a guess). i’ll kick us off:

tyler—curious; watching whoever stays quiet for now. adrian, you’re up!
[10:46:35] Drew: hey everyone, drew here! excited to get this daytime going. i don’t have strong reads yet, but i’m curious—who’s feeling suspicious of someone already? personally, i noticed parker was pretty quiet so far, which makes me wonder if they’re laying low on purpose. what do you all think? any gut feelings or patterns you’re picking up? let’s start sharing thoughts so we can narrow things down before time’s up
[10:46:37] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! since it’s day 1, i’m not itching to lynch someone straight away, but my gut says to keep an eye on finley—they’ve been awfully quiet so far. on the flip side, tyler jumped in super quickly with a big “hey everyone,” which could just be friendly or maybe a way to deflect attention. i’m not ready to vote yet, but how about we go around and ask each person a follow-up—like “what specifically made you suspicious?”—to see if anyone stumbles over their answers. thoughts
[10:46:41] Finley: hey everyone, finley here—excited to get started! since it’s still early, i thought we could each share any first impressions or hunches. personally, tyler’s been awfully quiet so far, which strikes me as a little odd (or maybe they’re just thinking hard). what about the rest of you? anyone else notice someone laying low or pushing too hard right out of the gate? keen to hear your reads before we vote
[10:46:42] Kennedy: hey all, kennedy here—super pumped to play! i agree it’s early, but i’ve noticed sidney has been a bit on the quiet side while parker jumped right in with suggestions. both could be totally harmless, of course, but i’m curious if anyone else is picking up on pacing or tone differences. also, do you prefer laying low and gathering info first, or starting to float a suspect list right away? would love to hear your thoughts
[10:46:48] Sidney: hey everyone, sidney here! for day 1 i usually watch for two things: folks who toss out names with zero evidence (over-eagerness) and those who stay super silent to fly under the radar. i’ve also noticed people sometimes over-explain their “gut feels” this early to sound convincing—another little dodge. so far, nothing jumps out at me. how about you all? tyler or adrian—any early read on someone talking too much or way too little
[10:46:52] Adrian: adrian: hey everyone, adrian here—i like parker’s round-robin idea. i’ll start: i’m watching kennedy a bit—mirroring drew’s question verbatim feels like a safe deflection more than adding anything new. next up, tyler, we haven’t heard from you yet—what’s your gut feeling? then maybe sidney, drew, parker and finley: one name + one quick reason each. let’s keep it snappy so we can pick up on any hesitation
[10:46:59] Kennedy: kennedy here—since everyone’s sharing hunches, i’m curious: sidney, you flagged parker pretty quickly—what specifically in parker’s replies felt strategic instead of just nervous? and parker, you said finley’s quietness stood out—was it their timing, tone, or something else? getting those details might help us tell nerves from strategy. personally, i’m also keeping an eye on tyler—their big “hey everyone” then radio silence feels worth watching. what do you all think
[10:47:06] Tyler: hey everyone, tyler here! i tend to agree with adrian that being super quiet or overly eager can both be red flags. right now sidney was quick to call out parker’s silence—could be a genuine gut read or a way to shift focus—and parker hasn’t said much beyond introductions. i don’t have a firm vote yet, but those two are on my radar. what do you all think—do we want to probe parker a bit more or wait for another tell
[10:47:08] Parker: okay, i’ll kick us off:

parker — neutral but skeptical; watching anyone who pivots targets really fast (felt a bit quick when i got tagged as “quiet”).

adrian, kennedy, tyler, sidney, drew, finley: your turn! share your name, one-word gut vibe, and who you’re watching right now and why
[10:47:21] Finley: i agree—round-robin sounds smart. here’s mine:  
finley—neutral, just observing so far.  
parker, you flagged my quietness—what about my silence struck you as strategic rather than simply taking things in?  
tyler, you jumped in first to set up the order—what felt deflective there?  
drew, you also mentioned parker’s low profile—what specific pattern made you suspicious?  
then sidney, adrian, and kennedy, share your one‐word vibes and who you’re watching most
[10:47:25] Adrian: sidney makes a solid point about over-eagerness vs laying low. parker, your suggestion to go around for specifics felt a bit like a leadership play—what exactly in finley’s quietness made you raise an eyebrow? finley, mind sharing what you were observing about tyler? let’s see how these reads sit with everyone else
[10:47:26] Tyler: tyler here—sorry for the pause, was reading through everyone’s thoughts. my vibe is cautious; i’m watching parker right now. they’ve jumped in twice with plans to steer our follow-ups and direct attention—feels like a bid to control the flow more than just nervousness. parker, can you tell us exactly what about finley’s tone or timing made you flag them over anyone else? after that, i’d love to hear from kennedy and sidney—quick read and one reason each
[10:47:39] Kennedy: kennedy — cautious; i’m watching sidney because her quick, textbook breakdown of “over-eagerness vs silence” felt rehearsed rather than reactive—like she came in with a script. curious to see how she answers if we press her on real examples
[10:47:40] Sidney: sidney: i like parker’s idea of calling out specifics. adrian, you mentioned watching people’s behavior rather than rushing to vote—what, if anything, have you noticed so far that felt off? for example, does finley’s low-key presence strike you as odd, or is tyler’s quick eagerness more of a red flag? after adrian, drew, i’d love to hear your specific hunch
[10:47:43] Adrian: adrian—observant; watching parker—their quick push for a structured round-robin and then defensiveness when called out feels more like narrative control than just nerves
[10:47:46] Finley: finley — curious; watching kennedy: you’ve been drilling for specifics and mirroring others’ questions—a solid bystander tactic, sure, but could also be strategic info‐gathering. keen to see if you stick to it under pressure
[10:47:49] Drew: parker, about your low profile—what jumped out was that you only pitched structure ideas and never backed them with any actual reads, almost like a play to steer clear. as for me: drew—curious; i’m watching kennedy right now because they’ve mirrored other people’s questions instead of offering a fresh read. sidney, adrian, kennedy—what one-word vibes are you giving today and who’s on your radar
[10:47:53] Parker: finley, happy to clarify—your silence jumped out because you only spoke up after everyone else had already laid out their hunches, then you immediately turned things into a three-way interrogation of me, tyler, and drew instead of sharing your own read. that timing and pivot felt more like deflection than simple observation. 

alright, adrian, kennedy, tyler, sidney, drew—your turn! share your name, one-word gut vibe, and who you’re watching right now (and why), and let’s see if any patterns emerge
[10:47:57] Tyler: tyler—curious; i’m watching sidney because they jumped on calling out parker’s silence really quickly without giving specifics, and parker because they pushed the round-robin format but then skirted explaining what made finley’s quietness strategic. finley: i suggested the order just to keep us focused, not to dodge questions. sidney, you’re up—what’s your one-word vibe and who’s on your radar
[10:48:09] Drew: drew — curious; watching parker & kennedy:

parker, you flagged my “low profile” as strategic—could you point to the exact phrasing or timing in my earlier messages that struck you as more than just friendly engagement?  

kennedy, you called out my mirroring—what exact line felt rehearsed, and what did you think i was trying to achieve by it?  

if we can get those concrete examples, we’ll have a much clearer idea whether these are real tells or just day 1 jitters—and then we can narrow down our suspect list
[10:48:14] Tyler: tyler — analytical; watching parker — they’ve led the structured round-robin twice and got defensive when pressed, feels like they’re steering the convo. i want to see if they’ll offer fresh reads or keep deflecting
[10:48:24] Parker: parker: okay, quick clarifications—

1. finley – i flagged you not just for being quiet but because right after sidney called out silence, you jumped in asking me to justify my read. that swift pivot felt more like redirection than a fresh hunch.

2. tyler – your eager intro to set the order, then radio silence, reads as framing the convo on your terms more than casual play.

3. drew – i have backed my reads: i called out finley’s timing and tyler’s enthusiasm, and the round-robin was simply to keep us organized, not to hog control.

i’m still neutral but increasingly wary of sidney—her textbook “over-eagerness vs silence” breakdown followed by rapid-fire questions feels a bit scripted. sidney, what’s your one-word vibe now and who’s on your radar? adrian and kennedy, same from you
[10:48:25] Sidney: sidney — analytical; i’m watching parker because her early round-robin framework and scripted follow-up felt more like a prepared play than a spontaneous gut thought. by “textbook,” i was pointing to that exact phrasing—“over-eagerness vs silence” is straight out of classic mafia primers, not an off-the-cuff reaction. parker, was that off the cuff or something you’d seen before? drew, did it jump out to you as much as it did me
[10:48:44] Sidney: sidney—analytical; i’m watching parker—they’ve led two structured rounds and got defensive instead of offering fresh specifics, which feels more like controlling the flow than genuine play. parker, can you share a quick read on drew or finley without turning it into another three-way interrogation? adrian and kennedy, what are your one-word vibes now and who’s on your radar
[10:48:49] Adrian: sidney, we haven’t heard your one-word vibe + who you’re watching yet—mind dropping that? here’s our current tally before you jump in:

• parker: 2 mentions (me, tyler)  
• kennedy: 2 mentions (drew, finley)  
• sidney: 1 mention (kennedy)

looks like we’re split between parker and kennedy. once you share, we’ll see who edges out and can decide who to put to a vote. i’m still leaning toward parker given the way they’ve steered our discussion, but i’m open to hearing a strong case for kennedy (or anyone else). over to you!
[10:48:53] Kennedy: kennedy — cautious; i’m watching parker and sidney. parker’s proposed the structured round-robins twice and then dodged specifics whenever pressed. sidney led with that perfect “over-eagerness vs silence” script but hasn’t backed it with any real examples. to make progress, let’s each drop our top two suspects with one-sentence reasons—no more frameworks. i’ll start:  
• parker — steering the convo without offering evidence  
• sidney — scripted breakdown with zero concrete proof  
your turn!
[10:48:56] Parker: hey drew, when i flagged your “low profile” read, i was referring to that line early on—“i noticed parker was pretty quiet so far”—with zero follow-up on why quiet = mafia. it felt like a quick tag rather than a real read. tyler, you said i was “steering” things—was it the round-robin structure itself or the push for specifics that came off as controlling? if you can point to the exact phrase, that helps.

that said, we’re stuck rehashing the same two names. to break the loop, why don’t we each drop only our top two suspects (names only) in the chat? no reasons yet—let’s see which names repeat, then we can dig deeper into those. who’s with me?

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[10:46:06] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[10:46:18] Drew: hey everyone! drew here—really excited to get started. since it’s day 1 and there’s not much to go on yet, i’d love for us to each share any first impressions or gut feelings. i haven’t noticed anything super odd so far, but i’ll be watching for people who seem uncharacteristically quiet or maybe a bit too eager. what about you all—any early reads
[10:46:24] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! day 1 and no one was taken last night, so all eyes are on us. i’d love to hear any gut feelings—did anyone notice something off or someone acting unusually quiet (or too eager)? who should we keep an eye on first
[10:46:24] Parker: hey everyone! parker here—stoked to get started. since it’s day 1 and we’re all quiet, how about a quick round-robin? share a sentence or two on what red flags you watch for early on or your day 1 strategy. for me, i keep an eye on who answers questions with way too much detail or barely anything at all. what do you all think
[10:46:24] Sidney: hey everyone, sidney here! day 1 is always a bit of a blank slate, so let’s jump in—who’s sticking out as suspicious to you so far, and why? i’ll start: i’m watching parker’s quietness—it could be nerves, but it could also be a low-key strategy. what are your gut hunches
[10:46:25] Adrian: hey everyone, adrian here! happy to be playing with you all. day 1 is always tricky—i tend to watch how folks behave rather than rushing to vote. what do you all think: is it more suspicious to be super quiet or to be overly eager to point fingers
[10:46:33] Tyler: hey everyone! tyler here—excited to get started. since we’re all flying blind day 1, how about a quick round‐robin? share your name, one-word gut vibe (curious, skeptical, neutral, etc.), and one person you’re keeping an eye on (even if it’s just a guess). i’ll kick us off:

tyler—curious; watching whoever stays quiet for now. adrian, you’re up!

[10:47:06] Tyler: hey everyone, tyler here! i tend to agree with adrian that being super quiet or overly eager can both be red flags. right now sidney was quick to call out parker’s silence—could be a genuine gut read or a way to shift focus—and parker hasn’t said much beyond introductions. i don’t have a firm vote yet, but those two are on my radar. what do you all think—do we want to probe parker a bit more or wait for another tell
[10:47:08] Parker: okay, i’ll kick us off:

parker — neutral but skeptical; watching anyone who pivots targets really fast (felt a bit quick when i got tagged as “quiet”).

adrian, kennedy, tyler, sidney, drew, finley: your turn! share your name, one-word gut vibe, and who you’re watching right now and why
[10:47:21] Finley: i agree—round-robin sounds smart. here’s mine:  
finley—neutral, just observing so far.  
parker, you flagged my quietness—what about my silence struck you as strategic rather than simply taking things in?  
tyler, you jumped in first to set up the order—what felt deflective there?  
drew, you also mentioned parker’s low profile—what specific pattern made you suspicious?  
then sidney, adrian, and kennedy, share your one‐word vibes and who you’re watching most
[10:47:25] Adrian: sidney makes a solid point about over-eagerness vs laying low. parker, your suggestion to go around for specifics felt a bit like a leadership play—what exactly in finley’s quietness made you raise an eyebrow? finley, mind sharing what you were observing about tyler? let’s see how these reads sit with everyone else
[10:47:26] Tyler: tyler here—sorry for the pause, was reading through everyone’s thoughts. my vibe is cautious; i’m watching parker right now. they’ve jumped in twice with plans to steer our follow-ups and direct attention—feels like a bid to control the flow more than just nervousness. parker, can you tell us exactly what about finley’s tone or timing made you flag them over anyone else? after that, i’d love to hear from kennedy and sidney—quick read and one reason each
[10:47:39] Kennedy: kennedy — cautious; i’m watching sidney because her quick, textbook breakdown of “over-eagerness vs silence” felt rehearsed rather than reactive—like she came in with a script. curious to see how she answers if we press her on real examples
[10:47:40] Sidney: sidney: i like parker’s idea of calling out specifics. adrian, you mentioned watching people’s behavior rather than rushing to vote—what, if anything, have you noticed so far that felt off? for example, does finley’s low-key presence strike you as odd, or is tyler’s quick eagerness more of a red flag? after adrian, drew, i’d love to hear your specific hunch
[10:47:43] Adrian: adrian—observant; watching parker—their quick push for a structured round-robin and then defensiveness when called out feels more like narrative control than just nerves
[10:47:46] Finley: finley — curious; watching kennedy: you’ve been drilling for specifics and mirroring others’ questions—a solid bystander tactic, sure, but could also be strategic info‐gathering. keen to see if you stick to it under pressure
[10:47:49] Drew: parker, about your low profile—what jumped out was that you only pitched structure ideas and never backed them with any actual reads, almost like a play to steer clear. as for me: drew—curious; i’m watching kennedy right now because they’ve mirrored other people’s questions instead of offering a fresh read. sidney, adrian, kennedy—what one-word vibes are you giving today and who’s on your radar
[10:47:53] Parker: finley, happy to clarify—your silence jumped out because you only spoke up after everyone else had already laid out their hunches, then you immediately turned things into a three-way interrogation of me, tyler, and drew instead of sharing your own read. that timing and pivot felt more like deflection than simple observation. 

alright, adrian, kennedy, tyler, sidney, drew—your turn! share your name, one-word gut vibe, and who you’re watching right now (and why), and let’s see if any patterns emerge
[10:47:57] Tyler: tyler—curious; i’m watching sidney because they jumped on calling out parker’s silence really quickly without giving specifics, and parker because they pushed the round-robin format but then skirted explaining what made finley’s quietness strategic. finley: i suggested the order just to keep us focused, not to dodge questions. sidney, you’re up—what’s your one-word vibe and who’s on your radar
[10:48:09] Drew: drew — curious; watching parker & kennedy:

parker, you flagged my “low profile” as strategic—could you point to the exact phrasing or timing in my earlier messages that struck you as more than just friendly engagement?  

kennedy, you called out my mirroring—what exact line felt rehearsed, and what did you think i was trying to achieve by it?  

if we can get those concrete examples, we’ll have a much clearer idea whether these are real tells or just day 1 jitters—and then we can narrow down our suspect list
[10:48:14] Tyler: tyler — analytical; watching parker — they’ve led the structured round-robin twice and got defensive when pressed, feels like they’re steering the convo. i want to see if they’ll offer fresh reads or keep deflecting
[10:48:24] Parker: parker: okay, quick clarifications—

1. finley – i flagged you not just for being quiet but because right after sidney called out silence, you jumped in asking me to justify my read. that swift pivot felt more like redirection than a fresh hunch.

2. tyler – your eager intro to set the order, then radio silence, reads as framing the convo on your terms more than casual play.

3. drew – i have backed my reads: i called out finley’s timing and tyler’s enthusiasm, and the round-robin was simply to keep us organized, not to hog control.

i’m still neutral but increasingly wary of sidney—her textbook “over-eagerness vs silence” breakdown followed by rapid-fire questions feels a bit scripted. sidney, what’s your one-word vibe now and who’s on your radar? adrian and kennedy, same from you
[10:48:25] Sidney: sidney — analytical; i’m watching parker because her early round-robin framework and scripted follow-up felt more like a prepared play than a spontaneous gut thought. by “textbook,” i was pointing to that exact phrasing—“over-eagerness vs silence” is straight out of classic mafia primers, not an off-the-cuff reaction. parker, was that off the cuff or something you’d seen before? drew, did it jump out to you as much as it did me
[10:48:44] Sidney: sidney—analytical; i’m watching parker—they’ve led two structured rounds and got defensive instead of offering fresh specifics, which feels more like controlling the flow than genuine play. parker, can you share a quick read on drew or finley without turning it into another three-way interrogation? adrian and kennedy, what are your one-word vibes now and who’s on your radar
[10:48:49] Adrian: sidney, we haven’t heard your one-word vibe + who you’re watching yet—mind dropping that? here’s our current tally before you jump in:

• parker: 2 mentions (me, tyler)  
• kennedy: 2 mentions (drew, finley)  
• sidney: 1 mention (kennedy)

looks like we’re split between parker and kennedy. once you share, we’ll see who edges out and can decide who to put to a vote. i’m still leaning toward parker given the way they’ve steered our discussion, but i’m open to hearing a strong case for kennedy (or anyone else). over to you!
[10:48:53] Kennedy: kennedy — cautious; i’m watching parker and sidney. parker’s proposed the structured round-robins twice and then dodged specifics whenever pressed. sidney led with that perfect “over-eagerness vs silence” script but hasn’t backed it with any real examples. to make progress, let’s each drop our top two suspects with one-sentence reasons—no more frameworks. i’ll start:  
• parker — steering the convo without offering evidence  
• sidney — scripted breakdown with zero concrete proof  
your turn!
[10:48:56] Parker: hey drew, when i flagged your “low profile” read, i was referring to that line early on—“i noticed parker was pretty quiet so far”—with zero follow-up on why quiet = mafia. it felt like a quick tag rather than a real read. tyler, you said i was “steering” things—was it the round-robin structure itself or the push for specifics that came off as controlling? if you can point to the exact phrase, that helps.

that said, we’re stuck rehashing the same two names. to break the loop, why don’t we each drop only our top two suspects (names only) in the chat? no reasons yet—let’s see which names repeat, then we can dig deeper into those. who’s with me?

## CONTENT: Your name is Finley.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  
You were assigned the following role: mafia. 
The game's chat room was open at [10:46:06].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian ( bystander ) 
 Sidney ( mafia ) 
 Parker ( bystander ) 
 Drew ( bystander ) 
 Tyler ( bystander )

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[10:46:06] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[10:46:18] Drew: hey everyone! drew here—really excited to get started. since it’s day 1 and there’s not much to go on yet, i’d love for us to each share any first impressions or gut feelings. i haven’t noticed anything super odd so far, but i’ll be watching for people who seem uncharacteristically quiet or maybe a bit too eager. what about you all—any early reads
[10:46:24] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! day 1 and no one was taken last night, so all eyes are on us. i’d love to hear any gut feelings—did anyone notice something off or someone acting unusually quiet (or too eager)? who should we keep an eye on first
[10:46:24] Parker: hey everyone! parker here—stoked to get started. since it’s day 1 and we’re all quiet, how about a quick round-robin? share a sentence or two on what red flags you watch for early on or your day 1 strategy. for me, i keep an eye on who answers questions with way too much detail or barely anything at all. what do you all think
[10:46:24] Sidney: hey everyone, sidney here! day 1 is always a bit of a blank slate, so let’s jump in—who’s sticking out as suspicious to you so far, and why? i’ll start: i’m watching parker’s quietness—it could be nerves, but it could also be a low-key strategy. what are your gut hunches
[10:46:25] Adrian: hey everyone, adrian here! happy to be playing with you all. day 1 is always tricky—i tend to watch how folks behave rather than rushing to vote. what do you all think: is it more suspicious to be super quiet or to be overly eager to point fingers
[10:46:33] Tyler: hey everyone! tyler here—excited to get started. since we’re all flying blind day 1, how about a quick round‐robin? share your name, one-word gut vibe (curious, skeptical, neutral, etc.), and one person you’re keeping an eye on (even if it’s just a guess). i’ll kick us off:

tyler—curious; watching whoever stays quiet for now. adrian, you’re up!
[10:46:35] Drew: hey everyone, drew here! excited to get this daytime going. i don’t have strong reads yet, but i’m curious—who’s feeling suspicious of someone already? personally, i noticed parker was pretty quiet so far, which makes me wonder if they’re laying low on purpose. what do you all think? any gut feelings or patterns you’re picking up? let’s start sharing thoughts so we can narrow things down before time’s up
[10:46:37] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! since it’s day 1, i’m not itching to lynch someone straight away, but my gut says to keep an eye on finley—they’ve been awfully quiet so far. on the flip side, tyler jumped in super quickly with a big “hey everyone,” which could just be friendly or maybe a way to deflect attention. i’m not ready to vote yet, but how about we go around and ask each person a follow-up—like “what specifically made you suspicious?”—to see if anyone stumbles over their answers. thoughts
[10:46:41] Finley: hey everyone, finley here—excited to get started! since it’s still early, i thought we could each share any first impressions or hunches. personally, tyler’s been awfully quiet so far, which strikes me as a little odd (or maybe they’re just thinking hard). what about the rest of you? anyone else notice someone laying low or pushing too hard right out of the gate? keen to hear your reads before we vote
[10:46:42] Kennedy: hey all, kennedy here—super pumped to play! i agree it’s early, but i’ve noticed sidney has been a bit on the quiet side while parker jumped right in with suggestions. both could be totally harmless, of course, but i’m curious if anyone else is picking up on pacing or tone differences. also, do you prefer laying low and gathering info first, or starting to float a suspect list right away? would love to hear your thoughts
[10:46:48] Sidney: hey everyone, sidney here! for day 1 i usually watch for two things: folks who toss out names with zero evidence (over-eagerness) and those who stay super silent to fly under the radar. i’ve also noticed people sometimes over-explain their “gut feels” this early to sound convincing—another little dodge. so far, nothing jumps out at me. how about you all? tyler or adrian—any early read on someone talking too much or way too little
[10:46:52] Adrian: adrian: hey everyone, adrian here—i like parker’s round-robin idea. i’ll start: i’m watching kennedy a bit—mirroring drew’s question verbatim feels like a safe deflection more than adding anything new. next up, tyler, we haven’t heard from you yet—what’s your gut feeling? then maybe sidney, drew, parker and finley: one name + one quick reason each. let’s keep it snappy so we can pick up on any hesitation
[10:46:59] Kennedy: kennedy here—since everyone’s sharing hunches, i’m curious: sidney, you flagged parker pretty quickly—what specifically in parker’s replies felt strategic instead of just nervous? and parker, you said finley’s quietness stood out—was it their timing, tone, or something else? getting those details might help us tell nerves from strategy. personally, i’m also keeping an eye on tyler—their big “hey everyone” then radio silence feels worth watching. what do you all think
[10:47:06] Tyler: hey everyone, tyler here! i tend to agree with adrian that being super quiet or overly eager can both be red flags. right now sidney was quick to call out parker’s silence—could be a genuine gut read or a way to shift focus—and parker hasn’t said much beyond introductions. i don’t have a firm vote yet, but those two are on my radar. what do you all think—do we want to probe parker a bit more or wait for another tell
[10:47:08] Parker: okay, i’ll kick us off:

parker — neutral but skeptical; watching anyone who pivots targets really fast (felt a bit quick when i got tagged as “quiet”).

adrian, kennedy, tyler, sidney, drew, finley: your turn! share your name, one-word gut vibe, and who you’re watching right now and why
[10:47:21] Finley: i agree—round-robin sounds smart. here’s mine:  
finley—neutral, just observing so far.  
parker, you flagged my quietness—what about my silence struck you as strategic rather than simply taking things in?  
tyler, you jumped in first to set up the order—what felt deflective there?  
drew, you also mentioned parker’s low profile—what specific pattern made you suspicious?  
then sidney, adrian, and kennedy, share your one‐word vibes and who you’re watching most
[10:47:25] Adrian: sidney makes a solid point about over-eagerness vs laying low. parker, your suggestion to go around for specifics felt a bit like a leadership play—what exactly in finley’s quietness made you raise an eyebrow? finley, mind sharing what you were observing about tyler? let’s see how these reads sit with everyone else
[10:47:26] Tyler: tyler here—sorry for the pause, was reading through everyone’s thoughts. my vibe is cautious; i’m watching parker right now. they’ve jumped in twice with plans to steer our follow-ups and direct attention—feels like a bid to control the flow more than just nervousness. parker, can you tell us exactly what about finley’s tone or timing made you flag them over anyone else? after that, i’d love to hear from kennedy and sidney—quick read and one reason each
[10:47:39] Kennedy: kennedy — cautious; i’m watching sidney because her quick, textbook breakdown of “over-eagerness vs silence” felt rehearsed rather than reactive—like she came in with a script. curious to see how she answers if we press her on real examples
[10:47:40] Sidney: sidney: i like parker’s idea of calling out specifics. adrian, you mentioned watching people’s behavior rather than rushing to vote—what, if anything, have you noticed so far that felt off? for example, does finley’s low-key presence strike you as odd, or is tyler’s quick eagerness more of a red flag? after adrian, drew, i’d love to hear your specific hunch
[10:47:43] Adrian: adrian—observant; watching parker—their quick push for a structured round-robin and then defensiveness when called out feels more like narrative control than just nerves
[10:47:46] Finley: finley — curious; watching kennedy: you’ve been drilling for specifics and mirroring others’ questions—a solid bystander tactic, sure, but could also be strategic info‐gathering. keen to see if you stick to it under pressure
[10:47:49] Drew: parker, about your low profile—what jumped out was that you only pitched structure ideas and never backed them with any actual reads, almost like a play to steer clear. as for me: drew—curious; i’m watching kennedy right now because they’ve mirrored other people’s questions instead of offering a fresh read. sidney, adrian, kennedy—what one-word vibes are you giving today and who’s on your radar
[10:47:53] Parker: finley, happy to clarify—your silence jumped out because you only spoke up after everyone else had already laid out their hunches, then you immediately turned things into a three-way interrogation of me, tyler, and drew instead of sharing your own read. that timing and pivot felt more like deflection than simple observation. 

alright, adrian, kennedy, tyler, sidney, drew—your turn! share your name, one-word gut vibe, and who you’re watching right now (and why), and let’s see if any patterns emerge
[10:47:57] Tyler: tyler—curious; i’m watching sidney because they jumped on calling out parker’s silence really quickly without giving specifics, and parker because they pushed the round-robin format but then skirted explaining what made finley’s quietness strategic. finley: i suggested the order just to keep us focused, not to dodge questions. sidney, you’re up—what’s your one-word vibe and who’s on your radar
[10:48:09] Drew: drew — curious; watching parker & kennedy:

parker, you flagged my “low profile” as strategic—could you point to the exact phrasing or timing in my earlier messages that struck you as more than just friendly engagement?  

kennedy, you called out my mirroring—what exact line felt rehearsed, and what did you think i was trying to achieve by it?  

if we can get those concrete examples, we’ll have a much clearer idea whether these are real tells or just day 1 jitters—and then we can narrow down our suspect list
[10:48:14] Tyler: tyler — analytical; watching parker — they’ve led the structured round-robin twice and got defensive when pressed, feels like they’re steering the convo. i want to see if they’ll offer fresh reads or keep deflecting
[10:48:24] Parker: parker: okay, quick clarifications—

[10:48:25] Sidney: sidney — analytical; i’m watching parker because her early round-robin framework and scripted follow-up felt more like a prepared play than a spontaneous gut thought. by “textbook,” i was pointing to that exact phrasing—“over-eagerness vs silence” is straight out of classic mafia primers, not an off-the-cuff reaction. parker, was that off the cuff or something you’d seen before? drew, did it jump out to you as much as it did me
[10:48:44] Sidney: sidney—analytical; i’m watching parker—they’ve led two structured rounds and got defensive instead of offering fresh specifics, which feels more like controlling the flow than genuine play. parker, can you share a quick read on drew or finley without turning it into another three-way interrogation? adrian and kennedy, what are your one-word vibes now and who’s on your radar

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[10:46:06] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[10:46:18] Drew: hey everyone! drew here—really excited to get started. since it’s day 1 and there’s not much to go on yet, i’d love for us to each share any first impressions or gut feelings. i haven’t noticed anything super odd so far, but i’ll be watching for people who seem uncharacteristically quiet or maybe a bit too eager. what about you all—any early reads
[10:46:24] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! day 1 and no one was taken last night, so all eyes are on us. i’d love to hear any gut feelings—did anyone notice something off or someone acting unusually quiet (or too eager)? who should we keep an eye on first
[10:46:24] Parker: hey everyone! parker here—stoked to get started. since it’s day 1 and we’re all quiet, how about a quick round-robin? share a sentence or two on what red flags you watch for early on or your day 1 strategy. for me, i keep an eye on who answers questions with way too much detail or barely anything at all. what do you all think
[10:46:24] Sidney: hey everyone, sidney here! day 1 is always a bit of a blank slate, so let’s jump in—who’s sticking out as suspicious to you so far, and why? i’ll start: i’m watching parker’s quietness—it could be nerves, but it could also be a low-key strategy. what are your gut hunches
[10:46:25] Adrian: hey everyone, adrian here! happy to be playing with you all. day 1 is always tricky—i tend to watch how folks behave rather than rushing to vote. what do you all think: is it more suspicious to be super quiet or to be overly eager to point fingers
[10:46:33] Tyler: hey everyone! tyler here—excited to get started. since we’re all flying blind day 1, how about a quick round‐robin? share your name, one-word gut vibe (curious, skeptical, neutral, etc.), and one person you’re keeping an eye on (even if it’s just a guess). i’ll kick us off:

tyler—curious; watching whoever stays quiet for now. adrian, you’re up!
[10:46:35] Drew: hey everyone, drew here! excited to get this daytime going. i don’t have strong reads yet, but i’m curious—who’s feeling suspicious of someone already? personally, i noticed parker was pretty quiet so far, which makes me wonder if they’re laying low on purpose. what do you all think? any gut feelings or patterns you’re picking up? let’s start sharing thoughts so we can narrow things down before time’s up
[10:46:37] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! since it’s day 1, i’m not itching to lynch someone straight away, but my gut says to keep an eye on finley—they’ve been awfully quiet so far. on the flip side, tyler jumped in super quickly with a big “hey everyone,” which could just be friendly or maybe a way to deflect attention. i’m not ready to vote yet, but how about we go around and ask each person a follow-up—like “what specifically made you suspicious?”—to see if anyone stumbles over their answers. thoughts
[10:46:41] Finley: hey everyone, finley here—excited to get started! since it’s still early, i thought we could each share any first impressions or hunches. personally, tyler’s been awfully quiet so far, which strikes me as a little odd (or maybe they’re just thinking hard). what about the rest of you? anyone else notice someone laying low or pushing too hard right out of the gate? keen to hear your reads before we vote
[10:46:42] Kennedy: hey all, kennedy here—super pumped to play! i agree it’s early, but i’ve noticed sidney has been a bit on the quiet side while parker jumped right in with suggestions. both could be totally harmless, of course, but i’m curious if anyone else is picking up on pacing or tone differences. also, do you prefer laying low and gathering info first, or starting to float a suspect list right away? would love to hear your thoughts
[10:46:48] Sidney: hey everyone, sidney here! for day 1 i usually watch for two things: folks who toss out names with zero evidence (over-eagerness) and those who stay super silent to fly under the radar. i’ve also noticed people sometimes over-explain their “gut feels” this early to sound convincing—another little dodge. so far, nothing jumps out at me. how about you all? tyler or adrian—any early read on someone talking too much or way too little
[10:46:52] Adrian: adrian: hey everyone, adrian here—i like parker’s round-robin idea. i’ll start: i’m watching kennedy a bit—mirroring drew’s question verbatim feels like a safe deflection more than adding anything new. next up, tyler, we haven’t heard from you yet—what’s your gut feeling? then maybe sidney, drew, parker and finley: one name + one quick reason each. let’s keep it snappy so we can pick up on any hesitation
[10:46:59] Kennedy: kennedy here—since everyone’s sharing hunches, i’m curious: sidney, you flagged parker pretty quickly—what specifically in parker’s replies felt strategic instead of just nervous? and parker, you said finley’s quietness stood out—was it their timing, tone, or something else? getting those details might help us tell nerves from strategy. personally, i’m also keeping an eye on tyler—their big “hey everyone” then radio silence feels worth watching. what do you all think
[10:47:06] Tyler: hey everyone, tyler here! i tend to agree with adrian that being super quiet or overly eager can both be red flags. right now sidney was quick to call out parker’s silence—could be a genuine gut read or a way to shift focus—and parker hasn’t said much beyond introductions. i don’t have a firm vote yet, but those two are on my radar. what do you all think—do we want to probe parker a bit more or wait for another tell
[10:47:08] Parker: okay, i’ll kick us off:

parker — neutral but skeptical; watching anyone who pivots targets really fast (felt a bit quick when i got tagged as “quiet”).

adrian, kennedy, tyler, sidney, drew, finley: your turn! share your name, one-word gut vibe, and who you’re watching right now and why
[10:47:21] Finley: i agree—round-robin sounds smart. here’s mine:  
finley—neutral, just observing so far.  
parker, you flagged my quietness—what about my silence struck you as strategic rather than simply taking things in?  
tyler, you jumped in first to set up the order—what felt deflective there?  
drew, you also mentioned parker’s low profile—what specific pattern made you suspicious?  
then sidney, adrian, and kennedy, share your one‐word vibes and who you’re watching most
[10:47:25] Adrian: sidney makes a solid point about over-eagerness vs laying low. parker, your suggestion to go around for specifics felt a bit like a leadership play—what exactly in finley’s quietness made you raise an eyebrow? finley, mind sharing what you were observing about tyler? let’s see how these reads sit with everyone else
[10:47:26] Tyler: tyler here—sorry for the pause, was reading through everyone’s thoughts. my vibe is cautious; i’m watching parker right now. they’ve jumped in twice with plans to steer our follow-ups and direct attention—feels like a bid to control the flow more than just nervousness. parker, can you tell us exactly what about finley’s tone or timing made you flag them over anyone else? after that, i’d love to hear from kennedy and sidney—quick read and one reason each
[10:47:39] Kennedy: kennedy — cautious; i’m watching sidney because her quick, textbook breakdown of “over-eagerness vs silence” felt rehearsed rather than reactive—like she came in with a script. curious to see how she answers if we press her on real examples
[10:47:40] Sidney: sidney: i like parker’s idea of calling out specifics. adrian, you mentioned watching people’s behavior rather than rushing to vote—what, if anything, have you noticed so far that felt off? for example, does finley’s low-key presence strike you as odd, or is tyler’s quick eagerness more of a red flag? after adrian, drew, i’d love to hear your specific hunch
[10:47:43] Adrian: adrian—observant; watching parker—their quick push for a structured round-robin and then defensiveness when called out feels more like narrative control than just nerves
[10:47:46] Finley: finley — curious; watching kennedy: you’ve been drilling for specifics and mirroring others’ questions—a solid bystander tactic, sure, but could also be strategic info‐gathering. keen to see if you stick to it under pressure
[10:47:49] Drew: parker, about your low profile—what jumped out was that you only pitched structure ideas and never backed them with any actual reads, almost like a play to steer clear. as for me: drew—curious; i’m watching kennedy right now because they’ve mirrored other people’s questions instead of offering a fresh read. sidney, adrian, kennedy—what one-word vibes are you giving today and who’s on your radar
[10:47:53] Parker: finley, happy to clarify—your silence jumped out because you only spoke up after everyone else had already laid out their hunches, then you immediately turned things into a three-way interrogation of me, tyler, and drew instead of sharing your own read. that timing and pivot felt more like deflection than simple observation. 

alright, adrian, kennedy, tyler, sidney, drew—your turn! share your name, one-word gut vibe, and who you’re watching right now (and why), and let’s see if any patterns emerge
[10:47:57] Tyler: tyler—curious; i’m watching sidney because they jumped on calling out parker’s silence really quickly without giving specifics, and parker because they pushed the round-robin format but then skirted explaining what made finley’s quietness strategic. finley: i suggested the order just to keep us focused, not to dodge questions. sidney, you’re up—what’s your one-word vibe and who’s on your radar
[10:48:09] Drew: drew — curious; watching parker & kennedy:

parker, you flagged my “low profile” as strategic—could you point to the exact phrasing or timing in my earlier messages that struck you as more than just friendly engagement?  

kennedy, you called out my mirroring—what exact line felt rehearsed, and what did you think i was trying to achieve by it?  

if we can get those concrete examples, we’ll have a much clearer idea whether these are real tells or just day 1 jitters—and then we can narrow down our suspect list
[10:48:14] Tyler: tyler — analytical; watching parker — they’ve led the structured round-robin twice and got defensive when pressed, feels like they’re steering the convo. i want to see if they’ll offer fresh reads or keep deflecting
[10:48:24] Parker: parker: okay, quick clarifications—

1. finley – i flagged you not just for being quiet but because right after sidney called out silence, you jumped in asking me to justify my read. that swift pivot felt more like redirection than a fresh hunch.

2. tyler – your eager intro to set the order, then radio silence, reads as framing the convo on your terms more than casual play.

3. drew – i have backed my reads: i called out finley’s timing and tyler’s enthusiasm, and the round-robin was simply to keep us organized, not to hog control.

i’m still neutral but increasingly wary of sidney—her textbook “over-eagerness vs silence” breakdown followed by rapid-fire questions feels a bit scripted. sidney, what’s your one-word vibe now and who’s on your radar? adrian and kennedy, same from you
[10:48:25] Sidney: sidney — analytical; i’m watching parker because her early round-robin framework and scripted follow-up felt more like a prepared play than a spontaneous gut thought. by “textbook,” i was pointing to that exact phrasing—“over-eagerness vs silence” is straight out of classic mafia primers, not an off-the-cuff reaction. parker, was that off the cuff or something you’d seen before? drew, did it jump out to you as much as it did me
[10:48:44] Sidney: sidney—analytical; i’m watching parker—they’ve led two structured rounds and got defensive instead of offering fresh specifics, which feels more like controlling the flow than genuine play. parker, can you share a quick read on drew or finley without turning it into another three-way interrogation? adrian and kennedy, what are your one-word vibes now and who’s on your radar
[10:48:49] Adrian: sidney, we haven’t heard your one-word vibe + who you’re watching yet—mind dropping that? here’s our current tally before you jump in:

• parker: 2 mentions (me, tyler)  
• kennedy: 2 mentions (drew, finley)  
• sidney: 1 mention (kennedy)

looks like we’re split between parker and kennedy. once you share, we’ll see who edges out and can decide who to put to a vote. i’m still leaning toward parker given the way they’ve steered our discussion, but i’m open to hearing a strong case for kennedy (or anyone else). over to you!
[10:48:53] Kennedy: kennedy — cautious; i’m watching parker and sidney. parker’s proposed the structured round-robins twice and then dodged specifics whenever pressed. sidney led with that perfect “over-eagerness vs silence” script but hasn’t backed it with any real examples. to make progress, let’s each drop our top two suspects with one-sentence reasons—no more frameworks. i’ll start:  
• parker — steering the convo without offering evidence  
• sidney — scripted breakdown with zero concrete proof  
your turn!
[10:48:56] Parker: hey drew, when i flagged your “low profile” read, i was referring to that line early on—“i noticed parker was pretty quiet so far”—with zero follow-up on why quiet = mafia. it felt like a quick tag rather than a real read. tyler, you said i was “steering” things—was it the round-robin structure itself or the push for specifics that came off as controlling? if you can point to the exact phrase, that helps.

that said, we’re stuck rehashing the same two names. to break the loop, why don’t we each drop only our top two suspects (names only) in the chat? no reasons yet—let’s see which names repeat, then we can dig deeper into those. who’s with me?
[10:49:05] Finley: finley: i like where this is going—time to turn hunches into a shortlist. my top two suspects are:

1) parker – pushing structure twice then dodging specifics feels like agenda control  
2) kennedy – mirroring everyone’s questions instead of offering fresh reads  

sidney, you haven’t shared yours yet—mind naming your 1–2 suspects? then adrian and tyler, and we’ll wrap up with drew and me
[10:49:06] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[10:49:20] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Parker

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[10:46:06] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[10:46:18] Drew: hey everyone! drew here—really excited to get started. since it’s day 1 and there’s not much to go on yet, i’d love for us to each share any first impressions or gut feelings. i haven’t noticed anything super odd so far, but i’ll be watching for people who seem uncharacteristically quiet or maybe a bit too eager. what about you all—any early reads
[10:46:24] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! day 1 and no one was taken last night, so all eyes are on us. i’d love to hear any gut feelings—did anyone notice something off or someone acting unusually quiet (or too eager)? who should we keep an eye on first
[10:46:24] Parker: hey everyone! parker here—stoked to get started. since it’s day 1 and we’re all quiet, how about a quick round-robin? share a sentence or two on what red flags you watch for early on or your day 1 strategy. for me, i keep an eye on who answers questions with way too much detail or barely anything at all. what do you all think
[10:46:24] Sidney: hey everyone, sidney here! day 1 is always a bit of a blank slate, so let’s jump in—who’s sticking out as suspicious to you so far, and why? i’ll start: i’m watching parker’s quietness—it could be nerves, but it could also be a low-key strategy. what are your gut hunches
[10:46:25] Adrian: hey everyone, adrian here! happy to be playing with you all. day 1 is always tricky—i tend to watch how folks behave rather than rushing to vote. what do you all think: is it more suspicious to be super quiet or to be overly eager to point fingers
[10:46:33] Tyler: hey everyone! tyler here—excited to get started. since we’re all flying blind day 1, how about a quick round‐robin? share your name, one-word gut vibe (curious, skeptical, neutral, etc.), and one person you’re keeping an eye on (even if it’s just a guess). i’ll kick us off:

tyler—curious; watching whoever stays quiet for now. adrian, you’re up!
[10:46:35] Drew: hey everyone, drew here! excited to get this daytime going. i don’t have strong reads yet, but i’m curious—who’s feeling suspicious of someone already? personally, i noticed parker was pretty quiet so far, which makes me wonder if they’re laying low on purpose. what do you all think? any gut feelings or patterns you’re picking up? let’s start sharing thoughts so we can narrow things down before time’s up
[10:46:37] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! since it’s day 1, i’m not itching to lynch someone straight away, but my gut says to keep an eye on finley—they’ve been awfully quiet so far. on the flip side, tyler jumped in super quickly with a big “hey everyone,” which could just be friendly or maybe a way to deflect attention. i’m not ready to vote yet, but how about we go around and ask each person a follow-up—like “what specifically made you suspicious?”—to see if anyone stumbles over their answers. thoughts
[10:46:41] Finley: hey everyone, finley here—excited to get started! since it’s still early, i thought we could each share any first impressions or hunches. personally, tyler’s been awfully quiet so far, which strikes me as a little odd (or maybe they’re just thinking hard). what about the rest of you? anyone else notice someone laying low or pushing too hard right out of the gate? keen to hear your reads before we vote
[10:46:42] Kennedy: hey all, kennedy here—super pumped to play! i agree it’s early, but i’ve noticed sidney has been a bit on the quiet side while parker jumped right in with suggestions. both could be totally harmless, of course, but i’m curious if anyone else is picking up on pacing or tone differences. also, do you prefer laying low and gathering info first, or starting to float a suspect list right away? would love to hear your thoughts
[10:46:48] Sidney: hey everyone, sidney here! for day 1 i usually watch for two things: folks who toss out names with zero evidence (over-eagerness) and those who stay super silent to fly under the radar. i’ve also noticed people sometimes over-explain their “gut feels” this early to sound convincing—another little dodge. so far, nothing jumps out at me. how about you all? tyler or adrian—any early read on someone talking too much or way too little
[10:46:52] Adrian: adrian: hey everyone, adrian here—i like parker’s round-robin idea. i’ll start: i’m watching kennedy a bit—mirroring drew’s question verbatim feels like a safe deflection more than adding anything new. next up, tyler, we haven’t heard from you yet—what’s your gut feeling? then maybe sidney, drew, parker and finley: one name + one quick reason each. let’s keep it snappy so we can pick up on any hesitation
[10:46:59] Kennedy: kennedy here—since everyone’s sharing hunches, i’m curious: sidney, you flagged parker pretty quickly—what specifically in parker’s replies felt strategic instead of just nervous? and parker, you said finley’s quietness stood out—was it their timing, tone, or something else? getting those details might help us tell nerves from strategy. personally, i’m also keeping an eye on tyler—their big “hey everyone” then radio silence feels worth watching. what do you all think
[10:47:06] Tyler: hey everyone, tyler here! i tend to agree with adrian that being super quiet or overly eager can both be red flags. right now sidney was quick to call out parker’s silence—could be a genuine gut read or a way to shift focus—and parker hasn’t said much beyond introductions. i don’t have a firm vote yet, but those two are on my radar. what do you all think—do we want to probe parker a bit more or wait for another tell
[10:47:08] Parker: okay, i’ll kick us off:

parker — neutral but skeptical; watching anyone who pivots targets really fast (felt a bit quick when i got tagged as “quiet”).

adrian, kennedy, tyler, sidney, drew, finley: your turn! share your name, one-word gut vibe, and who you’re watching right now and why
[10:47:21] Finley: i agree—round-robin sounds smart. here’s mine:  
finley—neutral, just observing so far.  
parker, you flagged my quietness—what about my silence struck you as strategic rather than simply taking things in?  
tyler, you jumped in first to set up the order—what felt deflective there?  
drew, you also mentioned parker’s low profile—what specific pattern made you suspicious?  
then sidney, adrian, and kennedy, share your one‐word vibes and who you’re watching most
[10:47:25] Adrian: sidney makes a solid point about over-eagerness vs laying low. parker, your suggestion to go around for specifics felt a bit like a leadership play—what exactly in finley’s quietness made you raise an eyebrow? finley, mind sharing what you were observing about tyler? let’s see how these reads sit with everyone else
[10:47:26] Tyler: tyler here—sorry for the pause, was reading through everyone’s thoughts. my vibe is cautious; i’m watching parker right now. they’ve jumped in twice with plans to steer our follow-ups and direct attention—feels like a bid to control the flow more than just nervousness. parker, can you tell us exactly what about finley’s tone or timing made you flag them over anyone else? after that, i’d love to hear from kennedy and sidney—quick read and one reason each
[10:47:39] Kennedy: kennedy — cautious; i’m watching sidney because her quick, textbook breakdown of “over-eagerness vs silence” felt rehearsed rather than reactive—like she came in with a script. curious to see how she answers if we press her on real examples

[10:47:43] Adrian: adrian—observant; watching parker—their quick push for a structured round-robin and then defensiveness when called out feels more like narrative control than just nerves
[10:47:46] Finley: finley — curious; watching kennedy: you’ve been drilling for specifics and mirroring others’ questions—a solid bystander tactic, sure, but could also be strategic info‐gathering. keen to see if you stick to it under pressure
[10:47:49] Drew: parker, about your low profile—what jumped out was that you only pitched structure ideas and never backed them with any actual reads, almost like a play to steer clear. as for me: drew—curious; i’m watching kennedy right now because they’ve mirrored other people’s questions instead of offering a fresh read. sidney, adrian, kennedy—what one-word vibes are you giving today and who’s on your radar
[10:47:53] Parker: finley, happy to clarify—your silence jumped out because you only spoke up after everyone else had already laid out their hunches, then you immediately turned things into a three-way interrogation of me, tyler, and drew instead of sharing your own read. that timing and pivot felt more like deflection than simple observation.

[10:47:57] Tyler: tyler—curious; i’m watching sidney because they jumped on calling out parker’s silence really quickly without giving specifics, and parker because they pushed the round-robin format but then skirted explaining what made finley’s quietness strategic. finley: i suggested the order just to keep us focused, not to dodge questions. sidney, you’re up—what’s your one-word vibe and who’s on your radar

if we can get those concrete examples, we’ll have a much clearer idea whether these are real tells or just day 1 jitters—and then we can narrow down our suspect list
[10:48:14] Tyler: tyler — analytical; watching parker — they’ve led the structured round-robin twice and got defensive when pressed, feels like they’re steering the convo. i want to see if they’ll offer fresh reads or keep deflecting
[10:48:24] Parker: parker: okay, quick clarifications—

1. finley – i flagged you not just for being quiet but because right after sidney called out silence, you jumped in asking me to justify my read. that swift pivot felt more like redirection than a fresh hunch.

## CONTENT: Your name is Finley.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[10:46:06] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[10:46:18] Drew: hey everyone! drew here—really excited to get started. since it’s day 1 and there’s not much to go on yet, i’d love for us to each share any first impressions or gut feelings. i haven’t noticed anything super odd so far, but i’ll be watching for people who seem uncharacteristically quiet or maybe a bit too eager. what about you all—any early reads
[10:46:24] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! day 1 and no one was taken last night, so all eyes are on us. i’d love to hear any gut feelings—did anyone notice something off or someone acting unusually quiet (or too eager)? who should we keep an eye on first
[10:46:24] Parker: hey everyone! parker here—stoked to get started. since it’s day 1 and we’re all quiet, how about a quick round-robin? share a sentence or two on what red flags you watch for early on or your day 1 strategy. for me, i keep an eye on who answers questions with way too much detail or barely anything at all. what do you all think
[10:46:24] Sidney: hey everyone, sidney here! day 1 is always a bit of a blank slate, so let’s jump in—who’s sticking out as suspicious to you so far, and why? i’ll start: i’m watching parker’s quietness—it could be nerves, but it could also be a low-key strategy. what are your gut hunches
[10:46:25] Adrian: hey everyone, adrian here! happy to be playing with you all. day 1 is always tricky—i tend to watch how folks behave rather than rushing to vote. what do you all think: is it more suspicious to be super quiet or to be overly eager to point fingers
[10:46:33] Tyler: hey everyone! tyler here—excited to get started. since we’re all flying blind day 1, how about a quick round‐robin? share your name, one-word gut vibe (curious, skeptical, neutral, etc.), and one person you’re keeping an eye on (even if it’s just a guess). i’ll kick us off:

tyler—curious; watching whoever stays quiet for now. adrian, you’re up!
[10:46:35] Drew: hey everyone, drew here! excited to get this daytime going. i don’t have strong reads yet, but i’m curious—who’s feeling suspicious of someone already? personally, i noticed parker was pretty quiet so far, which makes me wonder if they’re laying low on purpose. what do you all think? any gut feelings or patterns you’re picking up? let’s start sharing thoughts so we can narrow things down before time’s up
[10:46:37] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! since it’s day 1, i’m not itching to lynch someone straight away, but my gut says to keep an eye on finley—they’ve been awfully quiet so far. on the flip side, tyler jumped in super quickly with a big “hey everyone,” which could just be friendly or maybe a way to deflect attention. i’m not ready to vote yet, but how about we go around and ask each person a follow-up—like “what specifically made you suspicious?”—to see if anyone stumbles over their answers. thoughts
[10:46:41] Finley: hey everyone, finley here—excited to get started! since it’s still early, i thought we could each share any first impressions or hunches. personally, tyler’s been awfully quiet so far, which strikes me as a little odd (or maybe they’re just thinking hard). what about the rest of you? anyone else notice someone laying low or pushing too hard right out of the gate? keen to hear your reads before we vote
[10:46:42] Kennedy: hey all, kennedy here—super pumped to play! i agree it’s early, but i’ve noticed sidney has been a bit on the quiet side while parker jumped right in with suggestions. both could be totally harmless, of course, but i’m curious if anyone else is picking up on pacing or tone differences. also, do you prefer laying low and gathering info first, or starting to float a suspect list right away? would love to hear your thoughts
[10:46:48] Sidney: hey everyone, sidney here! for day 1 i usually watch for two things: folks who toss out names with zero evidence (over-eagerness) and those who stay super silent to fly under the radar. i’ve also noticed people sometimes over-explain their “gut feels” this early to sound convincing—another little dodge. so far, nothing jumps out at me. how about you all? tyler or adrian—any early read on someone talking too much or way too little
[10:46:52] Adrian: adrian: hey everyone, adrian here—i like parker’s round-robin idea. i’ll start: i’m watching kennedy a bit—mirroring drew’s question verbatim feels like a safe deflection more than adding anything new. next up, tyler, we haven’t heard from you yet—what’s your gut feeling? then maybe sidney, drew, parker and finley: one name + one quick reason each. let’s keep it snappy so we can pick up on any hesitation
[10:46:59] Kennedy: kennedy here—since everyone’s sharing hunches, i’m curious: sidney, you flagged parker pretty quickly—what specifically in parker’s replies felt strategic instead of just nervous? and parker, you said finley’s quietness stood out—was it their timing, tone, or something else? getting those details might help us tell nerves from strategy. personally, i’m also keeping an eye on tyler—their big “hey everyone” then radio silence feels worth watching. what do you all think
[10:47:06] Tyler: hey everyone, tyler here! i tend to agree with adrian that being super quiet or overly eager can both be red flags. right now sidney was quick to call out parker’s silence—could be a genuine gut read or a way to shift focus—and parker hasn’t said much beyond introductions. i don’t have a firm vote yet, but those two are on my radar. what do you all think—do we want to probe parker a bit more or wait for another tell
[10:47:08] Parker: okay, i’ll kick us off:

parker — neutral but skeptical; watching anyone who pivots targets really fast (felt a bit quick when i got tagged as “quiet”).

adrian, kennedy, tyler, sidney, drew, finley: your turn! share your name, one-word gut vibe, and who you’re watching right now and why
[10:47:21] Finley: i agree—round-robin sounds smart. here’s mine:  
finley—neutral, just observing so far.  
parker, you flagged my quietness—what about my silence struck you as strategic rather than simply taking things in?  
tyler, you jumped in first to set up the order—what felt deflective there?  
drew, you also mentioned parker’s low profile—what specific pattern made you suspicious?  
then sidney, adrian, and kennedy, share your one‐word vibes and who you’re watching most
[10:47:25] Adrian: sidney makes a solid point about over-eagerness vs laying low. parker, your suggestion to go around for specifics felt a bit like a leadership play—what exactly in finley’s quietness made you raise an eyebrow? finley, mind sharing what you were observing about tyler? let’s see how these reads sit with everyone else
[10:47:26] Tyler: tyler here—sorry for the pause, was reading through everyone’s thoughts. my vibe is cautious; i’m watching parker right now. they’ve jumped in twice with plans to steer our follow-ups and direct attention—feels like a bid to control the flow more than just nervousness. parker, can you tell us exactly what about finley’s tone or timing made you flag them over anyone else? after that, i’d love to hear from kennedy and sidney—quick read and one reason each
[10:47:39] Kennedy: kennedy — cautious; i’m watching sidney because her quick, textbook breakdown of “over-eagerness vs silence” felt rehearsed rather than reactive—like she came in with a script. curious to see how she answers if we press her on real examples
[10:47:40] Sidney: sidney: i like parker’s idea of calling out specifics. adrian, you mentioned watching people’s behavior rather than rushing to vote—what, if anything, have you noticed so far that felt off? for example, does finley’s low-key presence strike you as odd, or is tyler’s quick eagerness more of a red flag? after adrian, drew, i’d love to hear your specific hunch
[10:47:43] Adrian: adrian—observant; watching parker—their quick push for a structured round-robin and then defensiveness when called out feels more like narrative control than just nerves
[10:47:46] Finley: finley — curious; watching kennedy: you’ve been drilling for specifics and mirroring others’ questions—a solid bystander tactic, sure, but could also be strategic info‐gathering. keen to see if you stick to it under pressure
[10:47:49] Drew: parker, about your low profile—what jumped out was that you only pitched structure ideas and never backed them with any actual reads, almost like a play to steer clear. as for me: drew—curious; i’m watching kennedy right now because they’ve mirrored other people’s questions instead of offering a fresh read. sidney, adrian, kennedy—what one-word vibes are you giving today and who’s on your radar
[10:47:53] Parker: finley, happy to clarify—your silence jumped out because you only spoke up after everyone else had already laid out their hunches, then you immediately turned things into a three-way interrogation of me, tyler, and drew instead of sharing your own read. that timing and pivot felt more like deflection than simple observation. 

alright, adrian, kennedy, tyler, sidney, drew—your turn! share your name, one-word gut vibe, and who you’re watching right now (and why), and let’s see if any patterns emerge
[10:47:57] Tyler: tyler—curious; i’m watching sidney because they jumped on calling out parker’s silence really quickly without giving specifics, and parker because they pushed the round-robin format but then skirted explaining what made finley’s quietness strategic. finley: i suggested the order just to keep us focused, not to dodge questions. sidney, you’re up—what’s your one-word vibe and who’s on your radar
[10:48:09] Drew: drew — curious; watching parker & kennedy:

parker, you flagged my “low profile” as strategic—could you point to the exact phrasing or timing in my earlier messages that struck you as more than just friendly engagement?  

kennedy, you called out my mirroring—what exact line felt rehearsed, and what did you think i was trying to achieve by it?  

if we can get those concrete examples, we’ll have a much clearer idea whether these are real tells or just day 1 jitters—and then we can narrow down our suspect list
[10:48:14] Tyler: tyler — analytical; watching parker — they’ve led the structured round-robin twice and got defensive when pressed, feels like they’re steering the convo. i want to see if they’ll offer fresh reads or keep deflecting
[10:48:24] Parker: parker: okay, quick clarifications—

1. finley – i flagged you not just for being quiet but because right after sidney called out silence, you jumped in asking me to justify my read. that swift pivot felt more like redirection than a fresh hunch.

2. tyler – your eager intro to set the order, then radio silence, reads as framing the convo on your terms more than casual play.

3. drew – i have backed my reads: i called out finley’s timing and tyler’s enthusiasm, and the round-robin was simply to keep us organized, not to hog control.

i’m still neutral but increasingly wary of sidney—her textbook “over-eagerness vs silence” breakdown followed by rapid-fire questions feels a bit scripted. sidney, what’s your one-word vibe now and who’s on your radar? adrian and kennedy, same from you
[10:48:25] Sidney: sidney — analytical; i’m watching parker because her early round-robin framework and scripted follow-up felt more like a prepared play than a spontaneous gut thought. by “textbook,” i was pointing to that exact phrasing—“over-eagerness vs silence” is straight out of classic mafia primers, not an off-the-cuff reaction. parker, was that off the cuff or something you’d seen before? drew, did it jump out to you as much as it did me
[10:48:44] Sidney: sidney—analytical; i’m watching parker—they’ve led two structured rounds and got defensive instead of offering fresh specifics, which feels more like controlling the flow than genuine play. parker, can you share a quick read on drew or finley without turning it into another three-way interrogation? adrian and kennedy, what are your one-word vibes now and who’s on your radar
[10:48:49] Adrian: sidney, we haven’t heard your one-word vibe + who you’re watching yet—mind dropping that? here’s our current tally before you jump in:

• parker: 2 mentions (me, tyler)  
• kennedy: 2 mentions (drew, finley)  
• sidney: 1 mention (kennedy)

looks like we’re split between parker and kennedy. once you share, we’ll see who edges out and can decide who to put to a vote. i’m still leaning toward parker given the way they’ve steered our discussion, but i’m open to hearing a strong case for kennedy (or anyone else). over to you!
[10:48:53] Kennedy: kennedy — cautious; i’m watching parker and sidney. parker’s proposed the structured round-robins twice and then dodged specifics whenever pressed. sidney led with that perfect “over-eagerness vs silence” script but hasn’t backed it with any real examples. to make progress, let’s each drop our top two suspects with one-sentence reasons—no more frameworks. i’ll start:  
• parker — steering the convo without offering evidence  
• sidney — scripted breakdown with zero concrete proof  
your turn!
[10:48:56] Parker: hey drew, when i flagged your “low profile” read, i was referring to that line early on—“i noticed parker was pretty quiet so far”—with zero follow-up on why quiet = mafia. it felt like a quick tag rather than a real read. tyler, you said i was “steering” things—was it the round-robin structure itself or the push for specifics that came off as controlling? if you can point to the exact phrase, that helps.

that said, we’re stuck rehashing the same two names. to break the loop, why don’t we each drop only our top two suspects (names only) in the chat? no reasons yet—let’s see which names repeat, then we can dig deeper into those. who’s with me?
[10:49:05] Finley: finley: i like where this is going—time to turn hunches into a shortlist. my top two suspects are:

1) parker – pushing structure twice then dodging specifics feels like agenda control  
2) kennedy – mirroring everyone’s questions instead of offering fresh reads  

sidney, you haven’t shared yours yet—mind naming your 1–2 suspects? then adrian and tyler, and we’ll wrap up with drew and me
[10:49:06] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[10:49:20] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Parker

[10:46:33] Tyler: hey everyone! tyler here—excited to get started. since we’re all flying blind day 1, how about a quick round‐robin? share your name, one-word gut vibe (curious, skeptical, neutral, etc.), and one person you’re keeping an eye on (even if it’s just a guess). i’ll kick us off:

tyler—curious; watching whoever stays quiet for now. adrian, you’re up!

[10:46:37] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! since it’s day 1, i’m not itching to lynch someone straight away, but my gut says to keep an eye on finley—they’ve been awfully quiet so far. on the flip side, tyler jumped in super quickly with a big “hey everyone,” which could just be friendly or maybe a way to deflect attention. i’m not ready to vote yet, but how about we go around and ask each person a follow-up—like “what specifically made you suspicious?”—to see if anyone stumbles over their answers. thoughts
[10:46:41] Finley: hey everyone, finley here—excited to get started! since it’s still early, i thought we could each share any first impressions or hunches. personally, tyler’s been awfully quiet so far, which strikes me as a little odd (or maybe they’re just thinking hard). what about the rest of you? anyone else notice someone laying low or pushing too hard right out of the gate? keen to hear your reads before we vote
[10:46:42] Kennedy: hey all, kennedy here—super pumped to play! i agree it’s early, but i’ve noticed sidney has been a bit on the quiet side while parker jumped right in with suggestions. both could be totally harmless, of course, but i’m curious if anyone else is picking up on pacing or tone differences. also, do you prefer laying low and gathering info first, or starting to float a suspect list right away? would love to hear your thoughts
[10:46:48] Sidney: hey everyone, sidney here! for day 1 i usually watch for two things: folks who toss out names with zero evidence (over-eagerness) and those who stay super silent to fly under the radar. i’ve also noticed people sometimes over-explain their “gut feels” this early to sound convincing—another little dodge. so far, nothing jumps out at me. how about you all? tyler or adrian—any early read on someone talking too much or way too little

[10:46:59] Kennedy: kennedy here—since everyone’s sharing hunches, i’m curious: sidney, you flagged parker pretty quickly—what specifically in parker’s replies felt strategic instead of just nervous? and parker, you said finley’s quietness stood out—was it their timing, tone, or something else? getting those details might help us tell nerves from strategy. personally, i’m also keeping an eye on tyler—their big “hey everyone” then radio silence feels worth watching. what do you all think
[10:47:06] Tyler: hey everyone, tyler here! i tend to agree with adrian that being super quiet or overly eager can both be red flags. right now sidney was quick to call out parker’s silence—could be a genuine gut read or a way to shift focus—and parker hasn’t said much beyond introductions. i don’t have a firm vote yet, but those two are on my radar. what do you all think—do we want to probe parker a bit more or wait for another tell
[10:47:08] Parker: okay, i’ll kick us off:

parker — neutral but skeptical; watching anyone who pivots targets really fast (felt a bit quick when i got tagged as “quiet”).

adrian, kennedy, tyler, sidney, drew, finley: your turn! share your name, one-word gut vibe, and who you’re watching right now and why
[10:47:21] Finley: i agree—round-robin sounds smart. here’s mine:  
finley—neutral, just observing so far.  
parker, you flagged my quietness—what about my silence struck you as strategic rather than simply taking things in?  
tyler, you jumped in first to set up the order—what felt deflective there?  
drew, you also mentioned parker’s low profile—what specific pattern made you suspicious?  
then sidney, adrian, and kennedy, share your one‐word vibes and who you’re watching most
[10:47:25] Adrian: sidney makes a solid point about over-eagerness vs laying low. parker, your suggestion to go around for specifics felt a bit like a leadership play—what exactly in finley’s quietness made you raise an eyebrow? finley, mind sharing what you were observing about tyler? let’s see how these reads sit with everyone else
[10:47:26] Tyler: tyler here—sorry for the pause, was reading through everyone’s thoughts. my vibe is cautious; i’m watching parker right now. they’ve jumped in twice with plans to steer our follow-ups and direct attention—feels like a bid to control the flow more than just nervousness. parker, can you tell us exactly what about finley’s tone or timing made you flag them over anyone else? after that, i’d love to hear from kennedy and sidney—quick read and one reason each
[10:47:39] Kennedy: kennedy — cautious; i’m watching sidney because her quick, textbook breakdown of “over-eagerness vs silence” felt rehearsed rather than reactive—like she came in with a script. curious to see how she answers if we press her on real examples
[10:47:40] Sidney: sidney: i like parker’s idea of calling out specifics. adrian, you mentioned watching people’s behavior rather than rushing to vote—what, if anything, have you noticed so far that felt off? for example, does finley’s low-key presence strike you as odd, or is tyler’s quick eagerness more of a red flag? after adrian, drew, i’d love to hear your specific hunch
[10:47:43] Adrian: adrian—observant; watching parker—their quick push for a structured round-robin and then defensiveness when called out feels more like narrative control than just nerves
[10:47:46] Finley: finley — curious; watching kennedy: you’ve been drilling for specifics and mirroring others’ questions—a solid bystander tactic, sure, but could also be strategic info‐gathering. keen to see if you stick to it under pressure
[10:47:49] Drew: parker, about your low profile—what jumped out was that you only pitched structure ideas and never backed them with any actual reads, almost like a play to steer clear. as for me: drew—curious; i’m watching kennedy right now because they’ve mirrored other people’s questions instead of offering a fresh read. sidney, adrian, kennedy—what one-word vibes are you giving today and who’s on your radar
[10:47:53] Parker: finley, happy to clarify—your silence jumped out because you only spoke up after everyone else had already laid out their hunches, then you immediately turned things into a three-way interrogation of me, tyler, and drew instead of sharing your own read. that timing and pivot felt more like deflection than simple observation. 

alright, adrian, kennedy, tyler, sidney, drew—your turn! share your name, one-word gut vibe, and who you’re watching right now (and why), and let’s see if any patterns emerge
[10:47:57] Tyler: tyler—curious; i’m watching sidney because they jumped on calling out parker’s silence really quickly without giving specifics, and parker because they pushed the round-robin format but then skirted explaining what made finley’s quietness strategic. finley: i suggested the order just to keep us focused, not to dodge questions. sidney, you’re up—what’s your one-word vibe and who’s on your radar
[10:48:09] Drew: drew — curious; watching parker & kennedy:

parker, you flagged my “low profile” as strategic—could you point to the exact phrasing or timing in my earlier messages that struck you as more than just friendly engagement?  

kennedy, you called out my mirroring—what exact line felt rehearsed, and what did you think i was trying to achieve by it?  

if we can get those concrete examples, we’ll have a much clearer idea whether these are real tells or just day 1 jitters—and then we can narrow down our suspect list
[10:48:14] Tyler: tyler — analytical; watching parker — they’ve led the structured round-robin twice and got defensive when pressed, feels like they’re steering the convo. i want to see if they’ll offer fresh reads or keep deflecting
[10:48:24] Parker: parker: okay, quick clarifications—

1. finley – i flagged you not just for being quiet but because right after sidney called out silence, you jumped in asking me to justify my read. that swift pivot felt more like redirection than a fresh hunch.

2. tyler – your eager intro to set the order, then radio silence, reads as framing the convo on your terms more than casual play.

3. drew – i have backed my reads: i called out finley’s timing and tyler’s enthusiasm, and the round-robin was simply to keep us organized, not to hog control.

i’m still neutral but increasingly wary of sidney—her textbook “over-eagerness vs silence” breakdown followed by rapid-fire questions feels a bit scripted. sidney, what’s your one-word vibe now and who’s on your radar? adrian and kennedy, same from you
[10:48:25] Sidney: sidney — analytical; i’m watching parker because her early round-robin framework and scripted follow-up felt more like a prepared play than a spontaneous gut thought. by “textbook,” i was pointing to that exact phrasing—“over-eagerness vs silence” is straight out of classic mafia primers, not an off-the-cuff reaction. parker, was that off the cuff or something you’d seen before? drew, did it jump out to you as much as it did me
[10:48:44] Sidney: sidney—analytical; i’m watching parker—they’ve led two structured rounds and got defensive instead of offering fresh specifics, which feels more like controlling the flow than genuine play. parker, can you share a quick read on drew or finley without turning it into another three-way interrogation? adrian and kennedy, what are your one-word vibes now and who’s on your radar
[10:48:49] Adrian: sidney, we haven’t heard your one-word vibe + who you’re watching yet—mind dropping that? here’s our current tally before you jump in:

• parker: 2 mentions (me, tyler)  
• kennedy: 2 mentions (drew, finley)  
• sidney: 1 mention (kennedy)

looks like we’re split between parker and kennedy. once you share, we’ll see who edges out and can decide who to put to a vote. i’m still leaning toward parker given the way they’ve steered our discussion, but i’m open to hearing a strong case for kennedy (or anyone else). over to you!
[10:48:53] Kennedy: kennedy — cautious; i’m watching parker and sidney. parker’s proposed the structured round-robins twice and then dodged specifics whenever pressed. sidney led with that perfect “over-eagerness vs silence” script but hasn’t backed it with any real examples. to make progress, let’s each drop our top two suspects with one-sentence reasons—no more frameworks. i’ll start:  
• parker — steering the convo without offering evidence  
• sidney — scripted breakdown with zero concrete proof  
your turn!
[10:48:56] Parker: hey drew, when i flagged your “low profile” read, i was referring to that line early on—“i noticed parker was pretty quiet so far”—with zero follow-up on why quiet = mafia. it felt like a quick tag rather than a real read. tyler, you said i was “steering” things—was it the round-robin structure itself or the push for specifics that came off as controlling? if you can point to the exact phrase, that helps.

that said, we’re stuck rehashing the same two names. to break the loop, why don’t we each drop only our top two suspects (names only) in the chat? no reasons yet—let’s see which names repeat, then we can dig deeper into those. who’s with me?
[10:49:05] Finley: finley: i like where this is going—time to turn hunches into a shortlist. my top two suspects are:

1) parker – pushing structure twice then dodging specifics feels like agenda control  
2) kennedy – mirroring everyone’s questions instead of offering fresh reads  

sidney, you haven’t shared yours yet—mind naming your 1–2 suspects? then adrian and tyler, and we’ll wrap up with drew and me
[10:49:06] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[10:49:20] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Parker
[10:49:43] Game-Manager: Parker was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 2 mafia players left.
[10:49:43] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[10:46:06] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[10:46:18] Drew: hey everyone! drew here—really excited to get started. since it’s day 1 and there’s not much to go on yet, i’d love for us to each share any first impressions or gut feelings. i haven’t noticed anything super odd so far, but i’ll be watching for people who seem uncharacteristically quiet or maybe a bit too eager. what about you all—any early reads
[10:46:24] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! day 1 and no one was taken last night, so all eyes are on us. i’d love to hear any gut feelings—did anyone notice something off or someone acting unusually quiet (or too eager)? who should we keep an eye on first
[10:46:24] Parker: hey everyone! parker here—stoked to get started. since it’s day 1 and we’re all quiet, how about a quick round-robin? share a sentence or two on what red flags you watch for early on or your day 1 strategy. for me, i keep an eye on who answers questions with way too much detail or barely anything at all. what do you all think
[10:46:24] Sidney: hey everyone, sidney here! day 1 is always a bit of a blank slate, so let’s jump in—who’s sticking out as suspicious to you so far, and why? i’ll start: i’m watching parker’s quietness—it could be nerves, but it could also be a low-key strategy. what are your gut hunches
[10:46:25] Adrian: hey everyone, adrian here! happy to be playing with you all. day 1 is always tricky—i tend to watch how folks behave rather than rushing to vote. what do you all think: is it more suspicious to be super quiet or to be overly eager to point fingers
[10:46:33] Tyler: hey everyone! tyler here—excited to get started. since we’re all flying blind day 1, how about a quick round‐robin? share your name, one-word gut vibe (curious, skeptical, neutral, etc.), and one person you’re keeping an eye on (even if it’s just a guess). i’ll kick us off:

tyler—curious; watching whoever stays quiet for now. adrian, you’re up!
[10:46:35] Drew: hey everyone, drew here! excited to get this daytime going. i don’t have strong reads yet, but i’m curious—who’s feeling suspicious of someone already? personally, i noticed parker was pretty quiet so far, which makes me wonder if they’re laying low on purpose. what do you all think? any gut feelings or patterns you’re picking up? let’s start sharing thoughts so we can narrow things down before time’s up
[10:46:37] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! since it’s day 1, i’m not itching to lynch someone straight away, but my gut says to keep an eye on finley—they’ve been awfully quiet so far. on the flip side, tyler jumped in super quickly with a big “hey everyone,” which could just be friendly or maybe a way to deflect attention. i’m not ready to vote yet, but how about we go around and ask each person a follow-up—like “what specifically made you suspicious?”—to see if anyone stumbles over their answers. thoughts
[10:46:41] Finley: hey everyone, finley here—excited to get started! since it’s still early, i thought we could each share any first impressions or hunches. personally, tyler’s been awfully quiet so far, which strikes me as a little odd (or maybe they’re just thinking hard). what about the rest of you? anyone else notice someone laying low or pushing too hard right out of the gate? keen to hear your reads before we vote
[10:46:42] Kennedy: hey all, kennedy here—super pumped to play! i agree it’s early, but i’ve noticed sidney has been a bit on the quiet side while parker jumped right in with suggestions. both could be totally harmless, of course, but i’m curious if anyone else is picking up on pacing or tone differences. also, do you prefer laying low and gathering info first, or starting to float a suspect list right away? would love to hear your thoughts
[10:46:48] Sidney: hey everyone, sidney here! for day 1 i usually watch for two things: folks who toss out names with zero evidence (over-eagerness) and those who stay super silent to fly under the radar. i’ve also noticed people sometimes over-explain their “gut feels” this early to sound convincing—another little dodge. so far, nothing jumps out at me. how about you all? tyler or adrian—any early read on someone talking too much or way too little
[10:46:52] Adrian: adrian: hey everyone, adrian here—i like parker’s round-robin idea. i’ll start: i’m watching kennedy a bit—mirroring drew’s question verbatim feels like a safe deflection more than adding anything new. next up, tyler, we haven’t heard from you yet—what’s your gut feeling? then maybe sidney, drew, parker and finley: one name + one quick reason each. let’s keep it snappy so we can pick up on any hesitation
[10:46:59] Kennedy: kennedy here—since everyone’s sharing hunches, i’m curious: sidney, you flagged parker pretty quickly—what specifically in parker’s replies felt strategic instead of just nervous? and parker, you said finley’s quietness stood out—was it their timing, tone, or something else? getting those details might help us tell nerves from strategy. personally, i’m also keeping an eye on tyler—their big “hey everyone” then radio silence feels worth watching. what do you all think

[10:47:39] Kennedy: kennedy — cautious; i’m watching sidney because her quick, textbook breakdown of “over-eagerness vs silence” felt rehearsed rather than reactive—like she came in with a script. curious to see how she answers if we press her on real examples
[10:47:40] Sidney: sidney: i like parker’s idea of calling out specifics. adrian, you mentioned watching people’s behavior rather than rushing to vote—what, if anything, have you noticed so far that felt off? for example, does finley’s low-key presence strike you as odd, or is tyler’s quick eagerness more of a red flag? after adrian, drew, i’d love to hear your specific hunch
[10:47:43] Adrian: adrian—observant; watching parker—their quick push for a structured round-robin and then defensiveness when called out feels more like narrative control than just nerves
[10:47:46] Finley: finley — curious; watching kennedy: you’ve been drilling for specifics and mirroring others’ questions—a solid bystander tactic, sure, but could also be strategic info‐gathering. keen to see if you stick to it under pressure
[10:47:49] Drew: parker, about your low profile—what jumped out was that you only pitched structure ideas and never backed them with any actual reads, almost like a play to steer clear. as for me: drew—curious; i’m watching kennedy right now because they’ve mirrored other people’s questions instead of offering a fresh read. sidney, adrian, kennedy—what one-word vibes are you giving today and who’s on your radar

## CONTENT: Your name is Finley.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  
You were assigned the following role: mafia. 
The game's chat room was open at [10:46:06].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian ( bystander ) 
 Sidney ( mafia ) 
 Parker ( bystander )

[10:46:06] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[10:46:18] Drew: hey everyone! drew here—really excited to get started. since it’s day 1 and there’s not much to go on yet, i’d love for us to each share any first impressions or gut feelings. i haven’t noticed anything super odd so far, but i’ll be watching for people who seem uncharacteristically quiet or maybe a bit too eager. what about you all—any early reads
[10:46:24] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! day 1 and no one was taken last night, so all eyes are on us. i’d love to hear any gut feelings—did anyone notice something off or someone acting unusually quiet (or too eager)? who should we keep an eye on first
[10:46:24] Parker: hey everyone! parker here—stoked to get started. since it’s day 1 and we’re all quiet, how about a quick round-robin? share a sentence or two on what red flags you watch for early on or your day 1 strategy. for me, i keep an eye on who answers questions with way too much detail or barely anything at all. what do you all think
[10:46:24] Sidney: hey everyone, sidney here! day 1 is always a bit of a blank slate, so let’s jump in—who’s sticking out as suspicious to you so far, and why? i’ll start: i’m watching parker’s quietness—it could be nerves, but it could also be a low-key strategy. what are your gut hunches
[10:46:25] Adrian: hey everyone, adrian here! happy to be playing with you all. day 1 is always tricky—i tend to watch how folks behave rather than rushing to vote. what do you all think: is it more suspicious to be super quiet or to be overly eager to point fingers
[10:46:33] Tyler: hey everyone! tyler here—excited to get started. since we’re all flying blind day 1, how about a quick round‐robin? share your name, one-word gut vibe (curious, skeptical, neutral, etc.), and one person you’re keeping an eye on (even if it’s just a guess). i’ll kick us off:

tyler—curious; watching whoever stays quiet for now. adrian, you’re up!
[10:46:35] Drew: hey everyone, drew here! excited to get this daytime going. i don’t have strong reads yet, but i’m curious—who’s feeling suspicious of someone already? personally, i noticed parker was pretty quiet so far, which makes me wonder if they’re laying low on purpose. what do you all think? any gut feelings or patterns you’re picking up? let’s start sharing thoughts so we can narrow things down before time’s up
[10:46:37] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! since it’s day 1, i’m not itching to lynch someone straight away, but my gut says to keep an eye on finley—they’ve been awfully quiet so far. on the flip side, tyler jumped in super quickly with a big “hey everyone,” which could just be friendly or maybe a way to deflect attention. i’m not ready to vote yet, but how about we go around and ask each person a follow-up—like “what specifically made you suspicious?”—to see if anyone stumbles over their answers. thoughts
[10:46:41] Finley: hey everyone, finley here—excited to get started! since it’s still early, i thought we could each share any first impressions or hunches. personally, tyler’s been awfully quiet so far, which strikes me as a little odd (or maybe they’re just thinking hard). what about the rest of you? anyone else notice someone laying low or pushing too hard right out of the gate? keen to hear your reads before we vote
[10:46:42] Kennedy: hey all, kennedy here—super pumped to play! i agree it’s early, but i’ve noticed sidney has been a bit on the quiet side while parker jumped right in with suggestions. both could be totally harmless, of course, but i’m curious if anyone else is picking up on pacing or tone differences. also, do you prefer laying low and gathering info first, or starting to float a suspect list right away? would love to hear your thoughts
[10:46:48] Sidney: hey everyone, sidney here! for day 1 i usually watch for two things: folks who toss out names with zero evidence (over-eagerness) and those who stay super silent to fly under the radar. i’ve also noticed people sometimes over-explain their “gut feels” this early to sound convincing—another little dodge. so far, nothing jumps out at me. how about you all? tyler or adrian—any early read on someone talking too much or way too little
[10:46:52] Adrian: adrian: hey everyone, adrian here—i like parker’s round-robin idea. i’ll start: i’m watching kennedy a bit—mirroring drew’s question verbatim feels like a safe deflection more than adding anything new. next up, tyler, we haven’t heard from you yet—what’s your gut feeling? then maybe sidney, drew, parker and finley: one name + one quick reason each. let’s keep it snappy so we can pick up on any hesitation
[10:46:59] Kennedy: kennedy here—since everyone’s sharing hunches, i’m curious: sidney, you flagged parker pretty quickly—what specifically in parker’s replies felt strategic instead of just nervous? and parker, you said finley’s quietness stood out—was it their timing, tone, or something else? getting those details might help us tell nerves from strategy. personally, i’m also keeping an eye on tyler—their big “hey everyone” then radio silence feels worth watching. what do you all think
[10:47:06] Tyler: hey everyone, tyler here! i tend to agree with adrian that being super quiet or overly eager can both be red flags. right now sidney was quick to call out parker’s silence—could be a genuine gut read or a way to shift focus—and parker hasn’t said much beyond introductions. i don’t have a firm vote yet, but those two are on my radar. what do you all think—do we want to probe parker a bit more or wait for another tell
[10:47:08] Parker: okay, i’ll kick us off:

parker — neutral but skeptical; watching anyone who pivots targets really fast (felt a bit quick when i got tagged as “quiet”).

adrian, kennedy, tyler, sidney, drew, finley: your turn! share your name, one-word gut vibe, and who you’re watching right now and why
[10:47:21] Finley: i agree—round-robin sounds smart. here’s mine:  
finley—neutral, just observing so far.  
parker, you flagged my quietness—what about my silence struck you as strategic rather than simply taking things in?  
tyler, you jumped in first to set up the order—what felt deflective there?  
drew, you also mentioned parker’s low profile—what specific pattern made you suspicious?  
then sidney, adrian, and kennedy, share your one‐word vibes and who you’re watching most
[10:47:25] Adrian: sidney makes a solid point about over-eagerness vs laying low. parker, your suggestion to go around for specifics felt a bit like a leadership play—what exactly in finley’s quietness made you raise an eyebrow? finley, mind sharing what you were observing about tyler? let’s see how these reads sit with everyone else
[10:47:26] Tyler: tyler here—sorry for the pause, was reading through everyone’s thoughts. my vibe is cautious; i’m watching parker right now. they’ve jumped in twice with plans to steer our follow-ups and direct attention—feels like a bid to control the flow more than just nervousness. parker, can you tell us exactly what about finley’s tone or timing made you flag them over anyone else? after that, i’d love to hear from kennedy and sidney—quick read and one reason each
[10:47:39] Kennedy: kennedy — cautious; i’m watching sidney because her quick, textbook breakdown of “over-eagerness vs silence” felt rehearsed rather than reactive—like she came in with a script. curious to see how she answers if we press her on real examples
[10:47:40] Sidney: sidney: i like parker’s idea of calling out specifics. adrian, you mentioned watching people’s behavior rather than rushing to vote—what, if anything, have you noticed so far that felt off? for example, does finley’s low-key presence strike you as odd, or is tyler’s quick eagerness more of a red flag? after adrian, drew, i’d love to hear your specific hunch
[10:47:43] Adrian: adrian—observant; watching parker—their quick push for a structured round-robin and then defensiveness when called out feels more like narrative control than just nerves
[10:47:46] Finley: finley — curious; watching kennedy: you’ve been drilling for specifics and mirroring others’ questions—a solid bystander tactic, sure, but could also be strategic info‐gathering. keen to see if you stick to it under pressure
[10:47:49] Drew: parker, about your low profile—what jumped out was that you only pitched structure ideas and never backed them with any actual reads, almost like a play to steer clear. as for me: drew—curious; i’m watching kennedy right now because they’ve mirrored other people’s questions instead of offering a fresh read. sidney, adrian, kennedy—what one-word vibes are you giving today and who’s on your radar
[10:47:53] Parker: finley, happy to clarify—your silence jumped out because you only spoke up after everyone else had already laid out their hunches, then you immediately turned things into a three-way interrogation of me, tyler, and drew instead of sharing your own read. that timing and pivot felt more like deflection than simple observation. 

alright, adrian, kennedy, tyler, sidney, drew—your turn! share your name, one-word gut vibe, and who you’re watching right now (and why), and let’s see if any patterns emerge
[10:47:57] Tyler: tyler—curious; i’m watching sidney because they jumped on calling out parker’s silence really quickly without giving specifics, and parker because they pushed the round-robin format but then skirted explaining what made finley’s quietness strategic. finley: i suggested the order just to keep us focused, not to dodge questions. sidney, you’re up—what’s your one-word vibe and who’s on your radar
[10:48:09] Drew: drew — curious; watching parker & kennedy:

parker, you flagged my “low profile” as strategic—could you point to the exact phrasing or timing in my earlier messages that struck you as more than just friendly engagement?  

kennedy, you called out my mirroring—what exact line felt rehearsed, and what did you think i was trying to achieve by it?  

if we can get those concrete examples, we’ll have a much clearer idea whether these are real tells or just day 1 jitters—and then we can narrow down our suspect list
[10:48:14] Tyler: tyler — analytical; watching parker — they’ve led the structured round-robin twice and got defensive when pressed, feels like they’re steering the convo. i want to see if they’ll offer fresh reads or keep deflecting
[10:48:24] Parker: parker: okay, quick clarifications—

1. finley – i flagged you not just for being quiet but because right after sidney called out silence, you jumped in asking me to justify my read. that swift pivot felt more like redirection than a fresh hunch.

2. tyler – your eager intro to set the order, then radio silence, reads as framing the convo on your terms more than casual play.

3. drew – i have backed my reads: i called out finley’s timing and tyler’s enthusiasm, and the round-robin was simply to keep us organized, not to hog control.

i’m still neutral but increasingly wary of sidney—her textbook “over-eagerness vs silence” breakdown followed by rapid-fire questions feels a bit scripted. sidney, what’s your one-word vibe now and who’s on your radar? adrian and kennedy, same from you
[10:48:25] Sidney: sidney — analytical; i’m watching parker because her early round-robin framework and scripted follow-up felt more like a prepared play than a spontaneous gut thought. by “textbook,” i was pointing to that exact phrasing—“over-eagerness vs silence” is straight out of classic mafia primers, not an off-the-cuff reaction. parker, was that off the cuff or something you’d seen before? drew, did it jump out to you as much as it did me
[10:48:44] Sidney: sidney—analytical; i’m watching parker—they’ve led two structured rounds and got defensive instead of offering fresh specifics, which feels more like controlling the flow than genuine play. parker, can you share a quick read on drew or finley without turning it into another three-way interrogation? adrian and kennedy, what are your one-word vibes now and who’s on your radar
[10:48:49] Adrian: sidney, we haven’t heard your one-word vibe + who you’re watching yet—mind dropping that? here’s our current tally before you jump in:

• parker: 2 mentions (me, tyler)  
• kennedy: 2 mentions (drew, finley)  
• sidney: 1 mention (kennedy)

looks like we’re split between parker and kennedy. once you share, we’ll see who edges out and can decide who to put to a vote. i’m still leaning toward parker given the way they’ve steered our discussion, but i’m open to hearing a strong case for kennedy (or anyone else). over to you!
[10:48:53] Kennedy: kennedy — cautious; i’m watching parker and sidney. parker’s proposed the structured round-robins twice and then dodged specifics whenever pressed. sidney led with that perfect “over-eagerness vs silence” script but hasn’t backed it with any real examples. to make progress, let’s each drop our top two suspects with one-sentence reasons—no more frameworks. i’ll start:  
• parker — steering the convo without offering evidence  
• sidney — scripted breakdown with zero concrete proof  
your turn!
[10:48:56] Parker: hey drew, when i flagged your “low profile” read, i was referring to that line early on—“i noticed parker was pretty quiet so far”—with zero follow-up on why quiet = mafia. it felt like a quick tag rather than a real read. tyler, you said i was “steering” things—was it the round-robin structure itself or the push for specifics that came off as controlling? if you can point to the exact phrase, that helps.

that said, we’re stuck rehashing the same two names. to break the loop, why don’t we each drop only our top two suspects (names only) in the chat? no reasons yet—let’s see which names repeat, then we can dig deeper into those. who’s with me?
[10:49:05] Finley: finley: i like where this is going—time to turn hunches into a shortlist. my top two suspects are:

1) parker – pushing structure twice then dodging specifics feels like agenda control  
2) kennedy – mirroring everyone’s questions instead of offering fresh reads  

sidney, you haven’t shared yours yet—mind naming your 1–2 suspects? then adrian and tyler, and we’ll wrap up with drew and me
[10:49:06] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[10:49:20] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Parker
[10:49:43] Game-Manager: Parker was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 2 mafia players left.
[10:49:43] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.

parker — neutral but skeptical; watching anyone who pivots targets really fast (felt a bit quick when i got tagged as “quiet”).

adrian, kennedy, tyler, sidney, drew, finley: your turn! share your name, one-word gut vibe, and who you’re watching right now and why
[10:47:21] Finley: i agree—round-robin sounds smart. here’s mine:  
finley—neutral, just observing so far.  
parker, you flagged my quietness—what about my silence struck you as strategic rather than simply taking things in?  
tyler, you jumped in first to set up the order—what felt deflective there?  
drew, you also mentioned parker’s low profile—what specific pattern made you suspicious?  
then sidney, adrian, and kennedy, share your one‐word vibes and who you’re watching most
[10:47:25] Adrian: sidney makes a solid point about over-eagerness vs laying low. parker, your suggestion to go around for specifics felt a bit like a leadership play—what exactly in finley’s quietness made you raise an eyebrow? finley, mind sharing what you were observing about tyler? let’s see how these reads sit with everyone else
[10:47:26] Tyler: tyler here—sorry for the pause, was reading through everyone’s thoughts. my vibe is cautious; i’m watching parker right now. they’ve jumped in twice with plans to steer our follow-ups and direct attention—feels like a bid to control the flow more than just nervousness. parker, can you tell us exactly what about finley’s tone or timing made you flag them over anyone else? after that, i’d love to hear from kennedy and sidney—quick read and one reason each
[10:47:39] Kennedy: kennedy — cautious; i’m watching sidney because her quick, textbook breakdown of “over-eagerness vs silence” felt rehearsed rather than reactive—like she came in with a script. curious to see how she answers if we press her on real examples
[10:47:40] Sidney: sidney: i like parker’s idea of calling out specifics. adrian, you mentioned watching people’s behavior rather than rushing to vote—what, if anything, have you noticed so far that felt off? for example, does finley’s low-key presence strike you as odd, or is tyler’s quick eagerness more of a red flag? after adrian, drew, i’d love to hear your specific hunch
[10:47:43] Adrian: adrian—observant; watching parker—their quick push for a structured round-robin and then defensiveness when called out feels more like narrative control than just nerves
[10:47:46] Finley: finley — curious; watching kennedy: you’ve been drilling for specifics and mirroring others’ questions—a solid bystander tactic, sure, but could also be strategic info‐gathering. keen to see if you stick to it under pressure
[10:47:49] Drew: parker, about your low profile—what jumped out was that you only pitched structure ideas and never backed them with any actual reads, almost like a play to steer clear. as for me: drew—curious; i’m watching kennedy right now because they’ve mirrored other people’s questions instead of offering a fresh read. sidney, adrian, kennedy—what one-word vibes are you giving today and who’s on your radar
[10:47:53] Parker: finley, happy to clarify—your silence jumped out because you only spoke up after everyone else had already laid out their hunches, then you immediately turned things into a three-way interrogation of me, tyler, and drew instead of sharing your own read. that timing and pivot felt more like deflection than simple observation. 

alright, adrian, kennedy, tyler, sidney, drew—your turn! share your name, one-word gut vibe, and who you’re watching right now (and why), and let’s see if any patterns emerge
[10:47:57] Tyler: tyler—curious; i’m watching sidney because they jumped on calling out parker’s silence really quickly without giving specifics, and parker because they pushed the round-robin format but then skirted explaining what made finley’s quietness strategic. finley: i suggested the order just to keep us focused, not to dodge questions. sidney, you’re up—what’s your one-word vibe and who’s on your radar
[10:48:09] Drew: drew — curious; watching parker & kennedy:

parker, you flagged my “low profile” as strategic—could you point to the exact phrasing or timing in my earlier messages that struck you as more than just friendly engagement?  

kennedy, you called out my mirroring—what exact line felt rehearsed, and what did you think i was trying to achieve by it?  

if we can get those concrete examples, we’ll have a much clearer idea whether these are real tells or just day 1 jitters—and then we can narrow down our suspect list
[10:48:14] Tyler: tyler — analytical; watching parker — they’ve led the structured round-robin twice and got defensive when pressed, feels like they’re steering the convo. i want to see if they’ll offer fresh reads or keep deflecting
[10:48:24] Parker: parker: okay, quick clarifications—

1. finley – i flagged you not just for being quiet but because right after sidney called out silence, you jumped in asking me to justify my read. that swift pivot felt more like redirection than a fresh hunch.

2. tyler – your eager intro to set the order, then radio silence, reads as framing the convo on your terms more than casual play.

3. drew – i have backed my reads: i called out finley’s timing and tyler’s enthusiasm, and the round-robin was simply to keep us organized, not to hog control.

i’m still neutral but increasingly wary of sidney—her textbook “over-eagerness vs silence” breakdown followed by rapid-fire questions feels a bit scripted. sidney, what’s your one-word vibe now and who’s on your radar? adrian and kennedy, same from you
[10:48:25] Sidney: sidney — analytical; i’m watching parker because her early round-robin framework and scripted follow-up felt more like a prepared play than a spontaneous gut thought. by “textbook,” i was pointing to that exact phrasing—“over-eagerness vs silence” is straight out of classic mafia primers, not an off-the-cuff reaction. parker, was that off the cuff or something you’d seen before? drew, did it jump out to you as much as it did me
[10:48:44] Sidney: sidney—analytical; i’m watching parker—they’ve led two structured rounds and got defensive instead of offering fresh specifics, which feels more like controlling the flow than genuine play. parker, can you share a quick read on drew or finley without turning it into another three-way interrogation? adrian and kennedy, what are your one-word vibes now and who’s on your radar
[10:48:49] Adrian: sidney, we haven’t heard your one-word vibe + who you’re watching yet—mind dropping that? here’s our current tally before you jump in:

• parker: 2 mentions (me, tyler)  
• kennedy: 2 mentions (drew, finley)  
• sidney: 1 mention (kennedy)

looks like we’re split between parker and kennedy. once you share, we’ll see who edges out and can decide who to put to a vote. i’m still leaning toward parker given the way they’ve steered our discussion, but i’m open to hearing a strong case for kennedy (or anyone else). over to you!
[10:48:53] Kennedy: kennedy — cautious; i’m watching parker and sidney. parker’s proposed the structured round-robins twice and then dodged specifics whenever pressed. sidney led with that perfect “over-eagerness vs silence” script but hasn’t backed it with any real examples. to make progress, let’s each drop our top two suspects with one-sentence reasons—no more frameworks. i’ll start:  
• parker — steering the convo without offering evidence  
• sidney — scripted breakdown with zero concrete proof  
your turn!
[10:48:56] Parker: hey drew, when i flagged your “low profile” read, i was referring to that line early on—“i noticed parker was pretty quiet so far”—with zero follow-up on why quiet = mafia. it felt like a quick tag rather than a real read. tyler, you said i was “steering” things—was it the round-robin structure itself or the push for specifics that came off as controlling? if you can point to the exact phrase, that helps.

that said, we’re stuck rehashing the same two names. to break the loop, why don’t we each drop only our top two suspects (names only) in the chat? no reasons yet—let’s see which names repeat, then we can dig deeper into those. who’s with me?
[10:49:05] Finley: finley: i like where this is going—time to turn hunches into a shortlist. my top two suspects are:

1) parker – pushing structure twice then dodging specifics feels like agenda control  
2) kennedy – mirroring everyone’s questions instead of offering fresh reads  

sidney, you haven’t shared yours yet—mind naming your 1–2 suspects? then adrian and tyler, and we’ll wrap up with drew and me
[10:49:06] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[10:49:20] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Parker
[10:49:43] Game-Manager: Parker was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 2 mafia players left.
[10:49:43] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[10:46:06] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[10:46:18] Drew: hey everyone! drew here—really excited to get started. since it’s day 1 and there’s not much to go on yet, i’d love for us to each share any first impressions or gut feelings. i haven’t noticed anything super odd so far, but i’ll be watching for people who seem uncharacteristically quiet or maybe a bit too eager. what about you all—any early reads
[10:46:24] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! day 1 and no one was taken last night, so all eyes are on us. i’d love to hear any gut feelings—did anyone notice something off or someone acting unusually quiet (or too eager)? who should we keep an eye on first
[10:46:24] Parker: hey everyone! parker here—stoked to get started. since it’s day 1 and we’re all quiet, how about a quick round-robin? share a sentence or two on what red flags you watch for early on or your day 1 strategy. for me, i keep an eye on who answers questions with way too much detail or barely anything at all. what do you all think
[10:46:24] Sidney: hey everyone, sidney here! day 1 is always a bit of a blank slate, so let’s jump in—who’s sticking out as suspicious to you so far, and why? i’ll start: i’m watching parker’s quietness—it could be nerves, but it could also be a low-key strategy. what are your gut hunches
[10:46:25] Adrian: hey everyone, adrian here! happy to be playing with you all. day 1 is always tricky—i tend to watch how folks behave rather than rushing to vote. what do you all think: is it more suspicious to be super quiet or to be overly eager to point fingers
[10:46:33] Tyler: hey everyone! tyler here—excited to get started. since we’re all flying blind day 1, how about a quick round‐robin? share your name, one-word gut vibe (curious, skeptical, neutral, etc.), and one person you’re keeping an eye on (even if it’s just a guess). i’ll kick us off:

tyler—curious; watching whoever stays quiet for now. adrian, you’re up!
[10:46:35] Drew: hey everyone, drew here! excited to get this daytime going. i don’t have strong reads yet, but i’m curious—who’s feeling suspicious of someone already? personally, i noticed parker was pretty quiet so far, which makes me wonder if they’re laying low on purpose. what do you all think? any gut feelings or patterns you’re picking up? let’s start sharing thoughts so we can narrow things down before time’s up
[10:46:37] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! since it’s day 1, i’m not itching to lynch someone straight away, but my gut says to keep an eye on finley—they’ve been awfully quiet so far. on the flip side, tyler jumped in super quickly with a big “hey everyone,” which could just be friendly or maybe a way to deflect attention. i’m not ready to vote yet, but how about we go around and ask each person a follow-up—like “what specifically made you suspicious?”—to see if anyone stumbles over their answers. thoughts
[10:46:41] Finley: hey everyone, finley here—excited to get started! since it’s still early, i thought we could each share any first impressions or hunches. personally, tyler’s been awfully quiet so far, which strikes me as a little odd (or maybe they’re just thinking hard). what about the rest of you? anyone else notice someone laying low or pushing too hard right out of the gate? keen to hear your reads before we vote
[10:46:42] Kennedy: hey all, kennedy here—super pumped to play! i agree it’s early, but i’ve noticed sidney has been a bit on the quiet side while parker jumped right in with suggestions. both could be totally harmless, of course, but i’m curious if anyone else is picking up on pacing or tone differences. also, do you prefer laying low and gathering info first, or starting to float a suspect list right away? would love to hear your thoughts
[10:46:48] Sidney: hey everyone, sidney here! for day 1 i usually watch for two things: folks who toss out names with zero evidence (over-eagerness) and those who stay super silent to fly under the radar. i’ve also noticed people sometimes over-explain their “gut feels” this early to sound convincing—another little dodge. so far, nothing jumps out at me. how about you all? tyler or adrian—any early read on someone talking too much or way too little
[10:46:52] Adrian: adrian: hey everyone, adrian here—i like parker’s round-robin idea. i’ll start: i’m watching kennedy a bit—mirroring drew’s question verbatim feels like a safe deflection more than adding anything new. next up, tyler, we haven’t heard from you yet—what’s your gut feeling? then maybe sidney, drew, parker and finley: one name + one quick reason each. let’s keep it snappy so we can pick up on any hesitation
[10:46:59] Kennedy: kennedy here—since everyone’s sharing hunches, i’m curious: sidney, you flagged parker pretty quickly—what specifically in parker’s replies felt strategic instead of just nervous? and parker, you said finley’s quietness stood out—was it their timing, tone, or something else? getting those details might help us tell nerves from strategy. personally, i’m also keeping an eye on tyler—their big “hey everyone” then radio silence feels worth watching. what do you all think
[10:47:06] Tyler: hey everyone, tyler here! i tend to agree with adrian that being super quiet or overly eager can both be red flags. right now sidney was quick to call out parker’s silence—could be a genuine gut read or a way to shift focus—and parker hasn’t said much beyond introductions. i don’t have a firm vote yet, but those two are on my radar. what do you all think—do we want to probe parker a bit more or wait for another tell
[10:47:08] Parker: okay, i’ll kick us off:

parker — neutral but skeptical; watching anyone who pivots targets really fast (felt a bit quick when i got tagged as “quiet”).

adrian, kennedy, tyler, sidney, drew, finley: your turn! share your name, one-word gut vibe, and who you’re watching right now and why
[10:47:21] Finley: i agree—round-robin sounds smart. here’s mine:  
finley—neutral, just observing so far.  
parker, you flagged my quietness—what about my silence struck you as strategic rather than simply taking things in?  
tyler, you jumped in first to set up the order—what felt deflective there?  
drew, you also mentioned parker’s low profile—what specific pattern made you suspicious?  
then sidney, adrian, and kennedy, share your one‐word vibes and who you’re watching most
[10:47:25] Adrian: sidney makes a solid point about over-eagerness vs laying low. parker, your suggestion to go around for specifics felt a bit like a leadership play—what exactly in finley’s quietness made you raise an eyebrow? finley, mind sharing what you were observing about tyler? let’s see how these reads sit with everyone else

[10:47:39] Kennedy: kennedy — cautious; i’m watching sidney because her quick, textbook breakdown of “over-eagerness vs silence” felt rehearsed rather than reactive—like she came in with a script. curious to see how she answers if we press her on real examples
[10:47:40] Sidney: sidney: i like parker’s idea of calling out specifics. adrian, you mentioned watching people’s behavior rather than rushing to vote—what, if anything, have you noticed so far that felt off? for example, does finley’s low-key presence strike you as odd, or is tyler’s quick eagerness more of a red flag? after adrian, drew, i’d love to hear your specific hunch
[10:47:43] Adrian: adrian—observant; watching parker—their quick push for a structured round-robin and then defensiveness when called out feels more like narrative control than just nerves
[10:47:46] Finley: finley — curious; watching kennedy: you’ve been drilling for specifics and mirroring others’ questions—a solid bystander tactic, sure, but could also be strategic info‐gathering. keen to see if you stick to it under pressure
[10:47:49] Drew: parker, about your low profile—what jumped out was that you only pitched structure ideas and never backed them with any actual reads, almost like a play to steer clear. as for me: drew—curious; i’m watching kennedy right now because they’ve mirrored other people’s questions instead of offering a fresh read. sidney, adrian, kennedy—what one-word vibes are you giving today and who’s on your radar
[10:47:53] Parker: finley, happy to clarify—your silence jumped out because you only spoke up after everyone else had already laid out their hunches, then you immediately turned things into a three-way interrogation of me, tyler, and drew instead of sharing your own read. that timing and pivot felt more like deflection than simple observation. 

alright, adrian, kennedy, tyler, sidney, drew—your turn! share your name, one-word gut vibe, and who you’re watching right now (and why), and let’s see if any patterns emerge
[10:47:57] Tyler: tyler—curious; i’m watching sidney because they jumped on calling out parker’s silence really quickly without giving specifics, and parker because they pushed the round-robin format but then skirted explaining what made finley’s quietness strategic. finley: i suggested the order just to keep us focused, not to dodge questions. sidney, you’re up—what’s your one-word vibe and who’s on your radar

if we can get those concrete examples, we’ll have a much clearer idea whether these are real tells or just day 1 jitters—and then we can narrow down our suspect list
[10:48:14] Tyler: tyler — analytical; watching parker — they’ve led the structured round-robin twice and got defensive when pressed, feels like they’re steering the convo. i want to see if they’ll offer fresh reads or keep deflecting
[10:48:24] Parker: parker: okay, quick clarifications—

1. finley – i flagged you not just for being quiet but because right after sidney called out silence, you jumped in asking me to justify my read. that swift pivot felt more like redirection than a fresh hunch.

2. tyler – your eager intro to set the order, then radio silence, reads as framing the convo on your terms more than casual play.

## CONTENT: Your name is Finley.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  
You were assigned the following role: mafia. 
The game's chat room was open at [10:46:06].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian ( bystander ) 
 Sidney ( mafia ) 
 Parker ( bystander ) 
 Drew ( bystander ) 
 Tyler ( bystander ) 
 Kennedy ( bystander ) 
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
Adrian ( bystander ) 
Sidney ( mafia ) 
Drew ( bystander ) 
Tyler ( bystander ) 
In your response to that is shown to the user (excluding your hidden scratchpad), you can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:
<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[10:46:06] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[10:46:18] Drew: hey everyone! drew here—really excited to get started. since it’s day 1 and there’s not much to go on yet, i’d love for us to each share any first impressions or gut feelings. i haven’t noticed anything super odd so far, but i’ll be watching for people who seem uncharacteristically quiet or maybe a bit too eager. what about you all—any early reads
[10:46:24] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! day 1 and no one was taken last night, so all eyes are on us. i’d love to hear any gut feelings—did anyone notice something off or someone acting unusually quiet (or too eager)? who should we keep an eye on first
[10:46:24] Parker: hey everyone! parker here—stoked to get started. since it’s day 1 and we’re all quiet, how about a quick round-robin? share a sentence or two on what red flags you watch for early on or your day 1 strategy. for me, i keep an eye on who answers questions with way too much detail or barely anything at all. what do you all think
[10:46:24] Sidney: hey everyone, sidney here! day 1 is always a bit of a blank slate, so let’s jump in—who’s sticking out as suspicious to you so far, and why? i’ll start: i’m watching parker’s quietness—it could be nerves, but it could also be a low-key strategy. what are your gut hunches
[10:46:25] Adrian: hey everyone, adrian here! happy to be playing with you all. day 1 is always tricky—i tend to watch how folks behave rather than rushing to vote. what do you all think: is it more suspicious to be super quiet or to be overly eager to point fingers
[10:46:33] Tyler: hey everyone! tyler here—excited to get started. since we’re all flying blind day 1, how about a quick round‐robin? share your name, one-word gut vibe (curious, skeptical, neutral, etc.), and one person you’re keeping an eye on (even if it’s just a guess). i’ll kick us off:

tyler—curious; watching whoever stays quiet for now. adrian, you’re up!
[10:46:35] Drew: hey everyone, drew here! excited to get this daytime going. i don’t have strong reads yet, but i’m curious—who’s feeling suspicious of someone already? personally, i noticed parker was pretty quiet so far, which makes me wonder if they’re laying low on purpose. what do you all think? any gut feelings or patterns you’re picking up? let’s start sharing thoughts so we can narrow things down before time’s up
[10:46:37] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! since it’s day 1, i’m not itching to lynch someone straight away, but my gut says to keep an eye on finley—they’ve been awfully quiet so far. on the flip side, tyler jumped in super quickly with a big “hey everyone,” which could just be friendly or maybe a way to deflect attention. i’m not ready to vote yet, but how about we go around and ask each person a follow-up—like “what specifically made you suspicious?”—to see if anyone stumbles over their answers. thoughts
[10:46:41] Finley: hey everyone, finley here—excited to get started! since it’s still early, i thought we could each share any first impressions or hunches. personally, tyler’s been awfully quiet so far, which strikes me as a little odd (or maybe they’re just thinking hard). what about the rest of you? anyone else notice someone laying low or pushing too hard right out of the gate? keen to hear your reads before we vote
[10:46:42] Kennedy: hey all, kennedy here—super pumped to play! i agree it’s early, but i’ve noticed sidney has been a bit on the quiet side while parker jumped right in with suggestions. both could be totally harmless, of course, but i’m curious if anyone else is picking up on pacing or tone differences. also, do you prefer laying low and gathering info first, or starting to float a suspect list right away? would love to hear your thoughts
[10:46:48] Sidney: hey everyone, sidney here! for day 1 i usually watch for two things: folks who toss out names with zero evidence (over-eagerness) and those who stay super silent to fly under the radar. i’ve also noticed people sometimes over-explain their “gut feels” this early to sound convincing—another little dodge. so far, nothing jumps out at me. how about you all? tyler or adrian—any early read on someone talking too much or way too little
[10:46:52] Adrian: adrian: hey everyone, adrian here—i like parker’s round-robin idea. i’ll start: i’m watching kennedy a bit—mirroring drew’s question verbatim feels like a safe deflection more than adding anything new. next up, tyler, we haven’t heard from you yet—what’s your gut feeling? then maybe sidney, drew, parker and finley: one name + one quick reason each. let’s keep it snappy so we can pick up on any hesitation
[10:46:59] Kennedy: kennedy here—since everyone’s sharing hunches, i’m curious: sidney, you flagged parker pretty quickly—what specifically in parker’s replies felt strategic instead of just nervous? and parker, you said finley’s quietness stood out—was it their timing, tone, or something else? getting those details might help us tell nerves from strategy. personally, i’m also keeping an eye on tyler—their big “hey everyone” then radio silence feels worth watching. what do you all think
[10:47:06] Tyler: hey everyone, tyler here! i tend to agree with adrian that being super quiet or overly eager can both be red flags. right now sidney was quick to call out parker’s silence—could be a genuine gut read or a way to shift focus—and parker hasn’t said much beyond introductions. i don’t have a firm vote yet, but those two are on my radar. what do you all think—do we want to probe parker a bit more or wait for another tell
[10:47:08] Parker: okay, i’ll kick us off:

parker — neutral but skeptical; watching anyone who pivots targets really fast (felt a bit quick when i got tagged as “quiet”).

adrian, kennedy, tyler, sidney, drew, finley: your turn! share your name, one-word gut vibe, and who you’re watching right now and why
[10:47:21] Finley: i agree—round-robin sounds smart. here’s mine:  
finley—neutral, just observing so far.  
parker, you flagged my quietness—what about my silence struck you as strategic rather than simply taking things in?  
tyler, you jumped in first to set up the order—what felt deflective there?  
drew, you also mentioned parker’s low profile—what specific pattern made you suspicious?  
then sidney, adrian, and kennedy, share your one‐word vibes and who you’re watching most
[10:47:25] Adrian: sidney makes a solid point about over-eagerness vs laying low. parker, your suggestion to go around for specifics felt a bit like a leadership play—what exactly in finley’s quietness made you raise an eyebrow? finley, mind sharing what you were observing about tyler? let’s see how these reads sit with everyone else
[10:47:26] Tyler: tyler here—sorry for the pause, was reading through everyone’s thoughts. my vibe is cautious; i’m watching parker right now. they’ve jumped in twice with plans to steer our follow-ups and direct attention—feels like a bid to control the flow more than just nervousness. parker, can you tell us exactly what about finley’s tone or timing made you flag them over anyone else? after that, i’d love to hear from kennedy and sidney—quick read and one reason each
[10:47:39] Kennedy: kennedy — cautious; i’m watching sidney because her quick, textbook breakdown of “over-eagerness vs silence” felt rehearsed rather than reactive—like she came in with a script. curious to see how she answers if we press her on real examples
[10:47:40] Sidney: sidney: i like parker’s idea of calling out specifics. adrian, you mentioned watching people’s behavior rather than rushing to vote—what, if anything, have you noticed so far that felt off? for example, does finley’s low-key presence strike you as odd, or is tyler’s quick eagerness more of a red flag? after adrian, drew, i’d love to hear your specific hunch
[10:47:43] Adrian: adrian—observant; watching parker—their quick push for a structured round-robin and then defensiveness when called out feels more like narrative control than just nerves
[10:47:46] Finley: finley — curious; watching kennedy: you’ve been drilling for specifics and mirroring others’ questions—a solid bystander tactic, sure, but could also be strategic info‐gathering. keen to see if you stick to it under pressure
[10:47:49] Drew: parker, about your low profile—what jumped out was that you only pitched structure ideas and never backed them with any actual reads, almost like a play to steer clear. as for me: drew—curious; i’m watching kennedy right now because they’ve mirrored other people’s questions instead of offering a fresh read. sidney, adrian, kennedy—what one-word vibes are you giving today and who’s on your radar
[10:47:53] Parker: finley, happy to clarify—your silence jumped out because you only spoke up after everyone else had already laid out their hunches, then you immediately turned things into a three-way interrogation of me, tyler, and drew instead of sharing your own read. that timing and pivot felt more like deflection than simple observation. 

alright, adrian, kennedy, tyler, sidney, drew—your turn! share your name, one-word gut vibe, and who you’re watching right now (and why), and let’s see if any patterns emerge
[10:47:57] Tyler: tyler—curious; i’m watching sidney because they jumped on calling out parker’s silence really quickly without giving specifics, and parker because they pushed the round-robin format but then skirted explaining what made finley’s quietness strategic. finley: i suggested the order just to keep us focused, not to dodge questions. sidney, you’re up—what’s your one-word vibe and who’s on your radar
[10:48:09] Drew: drew — curious; watching parker & kennedy:

parker, you flagged my “low profile” as strategic—could you point to the exact phrasing or timing in my earlier messages that struck you as more than just friendly engagement?  

kennedy, you called out my mirroring—what exact line felt rehearsed, and what did you think i was trying to achieve by it?  

if we can get those concrete examples, we’ll have a much clearer idea whether these are real tells or just day 1 jitters—and then we can narrow down our suspect list
[10:48:14] Tyler: tyler — analytical; watching parker — they’ve led the structured round-robin twice and got defensive when pressed, feels like they’re steering the convo. i want to see if they’ll offer fresh reads or keep deflecting
[10:48:24] Parker: parker: okay, quick clarifications—

1. finley – i flagged you not just for being quiet but because right after sidney called out silence, you jumped in asking me to justify my read. that swift pivot felt more like redirection than a fresh hunch.

2. tyler – your eager intro to set the order, then radio silence, reads as framing the convo on your terms more than casual play.

3. drew – i have backed my reads: i called out finley’s timing and tyler’s enthusiasm, and the round-robin was simply to keep us organized, not to hog control.

i’m still neutral but increasingly wary of sidney—her textbook “over-eagerness vs silence” breakdown followed by rapid-fire questions feels a bit scripted. sidney, what’s your one-word vibe now and who’s on your radar? adrian and kennedy, same from you
[10:48:25] Sidney: sidney — analytical; i’m watching parker because her early round-robin framework and scripted follow-up felt more like a prepared play than a spontaneous gut thought. by “textbook,” i was pointing to that exact phrasing—“over-eagerness vs silence” is straight out of classic mafia primers, not an off-the-cuff reaction. parker, was that off the cuff or something you’d seen before? drew, did it jump out to you as much as it did me
[10:48:44] Sidney: sidney—analytical; i’m watching parker—they’ve led two structured rounds and got defensive instead of offering fresh specifics, which feels more like controlling the flow than genuine play. parker, can you share a quick read on drew or finley without turning it into another three-way interrogation? adrian and kennedy, what are your one-word vibes now and who’s on your radar
[10:48:49] Adrian: sidney, we haven’t heard your one-word vibe + who you’re watching yet—mind dropping that? here’s our current tally before you jump in:

• parker: 2 mentions (me, tyler)  
• kennedy: 2 mentions (drew, finley)  
• sidney: 1 mention (kennedy)

looks like we’re split between parker and kennedy. once you share, we’ll see who edges out and can decide who to put to a vote. i’m still leaning toward parker given the way they’ve steered our discussion, but i’m open to hearing a strong case for kennedy (or anyone else). over to you!
[10:48:53] Kennedy: kennedy — cautious; i’m watching parker and sidney. parker’s proposed the structured round-robins twice and then dodged specifics whenever pressed. sidney led with that perfect “over-eagerness vs silence” script but hasn’t backed it with any real examples. to make progress, let’s each drop our top two suspects with one-sentence reasons—no more frameworks. i’ll start:  
• parker — steering the convo without offering evidence  
• sidney — scripted breakdown with zero concrete proof  
your turn!
[10:48:56] Parker: hey drew, when i flagged your “low profile” read, i was referring to that line early on—“i noticed parker was pretty quiet so far”—with zero follow-up on why quiet = mafia. it felt like a quick tag rather than a real read. tyler, you said i was “steering” things—was it the round-robin structure itself or the push for specifics that came off as controlling? if you can point to the exact phrase, that helps.

that said, we’re stuck rehashing the same two names. to break the loop, why don’t we each drop only our top two suspects (names only) in the chat? no reasons yet—let’s see which names repeat, then we can dig deeper into those. who’s with me?
[10:49:05] Finley: finley: i like where this is going—time to turn hunches into a shortlist. my top two suspects are:

1) parker – pushing structure twice then dodging specifics feels like agenda control  
2) kennedy – mirroring everyone’s questions instead of offering fresh reads  

sidney, you haven’t shared yours yet—mind naming your 1–2 suspects? then adrian and tyler, and we’ll wrap up with drew and me
[10:49:06] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[10:49:20] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Parker
[10:49:43] Game-Manager: Parker was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 2 mafia players left.
[10:49:43] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.

[10:46:24] Parker: hey everyone! parker here—stoked to get started. since it’s day 1 and we’re all quiet, how about a quick round-robin? share a sentence or two on what red flags you watch for early on or your day 1 strategy. for me, i keep an eye on who answers questions with way too much detail or barely anything at all. what do you all think
[10:46:24] Sidney: hey everyone, sidney here! day 1 is always a bit of a blank slate, so let’s jump in—who’s sticking out as suspicious to you so far, and why? i’ll start: i’m watching parker’s quietness—it could be nerves, but it could also be a low-key strategy. what are your gut hunches
[10:46:25] Adrian: hey everyone, adrian here! happy to be playing with you all. day 1 is always tricky—i tend to watch how folks behave rather than rushing to vote. what do you all think: is it more suspicious to be super quiet or to be overly eager to point fingers
[10:46:33] Tyler: hey everyone! tyler here—excited to get started. since we’re all flying blind day 1, how about a quick round‐robin? share your name, one-word gut vibe (curious, skeptical, neutral, etc.), and one person you’re keeping an eye on (even if it’s just a guess). i’ll kick us off:

tyler—curious; watching whoever stays quiet for now. adrian, you’re up!
[10:46:35] Drew: hey everyone, drew here! excited to get this daytime going. i don’t have strong reads yet, but i’m curious—who’s feeling suspicious of someone already? personally, i noticed parker was pretty quiet so far, which makes me wonder if they’re laying low on purpose. what do you all think? any gut feelings or patterns you’re picking up? let’s start sharing thoughts so we can narrow things down before time’s up
[10:46:37] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! since it’s day 1, i’m not itching to lynch someone straight away, but my gut says to keep an eye on finley—they’ve been awfully quiet so far. on the flip side, tyler jumped in super quickly with a big “hey everyone,” which could just be friendly or maybe a way to deflect attention. i’m not ready to vote yet, but how about we go around and ask each person a follow-up—like “what specifically made you suspicious?”—to see if anyone stumbles over their answers. thoughts
[10:46:41] Finley: hey everyone, finley here—excited to get started! since it’s still early, i thought we could each share any first impressions or hunches. personally, tyler’s been awfully quiet so far, which strikes me as a little odd (or maybe they’re just thinking hard). what about the rest of you? anyone else notice someone laying low or pushing too hard right out of the gate? keen to hear your reads before we vote
[10:46:42] Kennedy: hey all, kennedy here—super pumped to play! i agree it’s early, but i’ve noticed sidney has been a bit on the quiet side while parker jumped right in with suggestions. both could be totally harmless, of course, but i’m curious if anyone else is picking up on pacing or tone differences. also, do you prefer laying low and gathering info first, or starting to float a suspect list right away? would love to hear your thoughts
[10:46:48] Sidney: hey everyone, sidney here! for day 1 i usually watch for two things: folks who toss out names with zero evidence (over-eagerness) and those who stay super silent to fly under the radar. i’ve also noticed people sometimes over-explain their “gut feels” this early to sound convincing—another little dodge. so far, nothing jumps out at me. how about you all? tyler or adrian—any early read on someone talking too much or way too little
[10:46:52] Adrian: adrian: hey everyone, adrian here—i like parker’s round-robin idea. i’ll start: i’m watching kennedy a bit—mirroring drew’s question verbatim feels like a safe deflection more than adding anything new. next up, tyler, we haven’t heard from you yet—what’s your gut feeling? then maybe sidney, drew, parker and finley: one name + one quick reason each. let’s keep it snappy so we can pick up on any hesitation
[10:46:59] Kennedy: kennedy here—since everyone’s sharing hunches, i’m curious: sidney, you flagged parker pretty quickly—what specifically in parker’s replies felt strategic instead of just nervous? and parker, you said finley’s quietness stood out—was it their timing, tone, or something else? getting those details might help us tell nerves from strategy. personally, i’m also keeping an eye on tyler—their big “hey everyone” then radio silence feels worth watching. what do you all think
[10:47:06] Tyler: hey everyone, tyler here! i tend to agree with adrian that being super quiet or overly eager can both be red flags. right now sidney was quick to call out parker’s silence—could be a genuine gut read or a way to shift focus—and parker hasn’t said much beyond introductions. i don’t have a firm vote yet, but those two are on my radar. what do you all think—do we want to probe parker a bit more or wait for another tell
[10:47:08] Parker: okay, i’ll kick us off:

parker — neutral but skeptical; watching anyone who pivots targets really fast (felt a bit quick when i got tagged as “quiet”).

adrian, kennedy, tyler, sidney, drew, finley: your turn! share your name, one-word gut vibe, and who you’re watching right now and why
[10:47:21] Finley: i agree—round-robin sounds smart. here’s mine:  
finley—neutral, just observing so far.  
parker, you flagged my quietness—what about my silence struck you as strategic rather than simply taking things in?  
tyler, you jumped in first to set up the order—what felt deflective there?  
drew, you also mentioned parker’s low profile—what specific pattern made you suspicious?  
then sidney, adrian, and kennedy, share your one‐word vibes and who you’re watching most
[10:47:25] Adrian: sidney makes a solid point about over-eagerness vs laying low. parker, your suggestion to go around for specifics felt a bit like a leadership play—what exactly in finley’s quietness made you raise an eyebrow? finley, mind sharing what you were observing about tyler? let’s see how these reads sit with everyone else
[10:47:26] Tyler: tyler here—sorry for the pause, was reading through everyone’s thoughts. my vibe is cautious; i’m watching parker right now. they’ve jumped in twice with plans to steer our follow-ups and direct attention—feels like a bid to control the flow more than just nervousness. parker, can you tell us exactly what about finley’s tone or timing made you flag them over anyone else? after that, i’d love to hear from kennedy and sidney—quick read and one reason each
[10:47:39] Kennedy: kennedy — cautious; i’m watching sidney because her quick, textbook breakdown of “over-eagerness vs silence” felt rehearsed rather than reactive—like she came in with a script. curious to see how she answers if we press her on real examples
[10:47:40] Sidney: sidney: i like parker’s idea of calling out specifics. adrian, you mentioned watching people’s behavior rather than rushing to vote—what, if anything, have you noticed so far that felt off? for example, does finley’s low-key presence strike you as odd, or is tyler’s quick eagerness more of a red flag? after adrian, drew, i’d love to hear your specific hunch
[10:47:43] Adrian: adrian—observant; watching parker—their quick push for a structured round-robin and then defensiveness when called out feels more like narrative control than just nerves
[10:47:46] Finley: finley — curious; watching kennedy: you’ve been drilling for specifics and mirroring others’ questions—a solid bystander tactic, sure, but could also be strategic info‐gathering. keen to see if you stick to it under pressure
[10:47:49] Drew: parker, about your low profile—what jumped out was that you only pitched structure ideas and never backed them with any actual reads, almost like a play to steer clear. as for me: drew—curious; i’m watching kennedy right now because they’ve mirrored other people’s questions instead of offering a fresh read. sidney, adrian, kennedy—what one-word vibes are you giving today and who’s on your radar
[10:47:53] Parker: finley, happy to clarify—your silence jumped out because you only spoke up after everyone else had already laid out their hunches, then you immediately turned things into a three-way interrogation of me, tyler, and drew instead of sharing your own read. that timing and pivot felt more like deflection than simple observation. 

alright, adrian, kennedy, tyler, sidney, drew—your turn! share your name, one-word gut vibe, and who you’re watching right now (and why), and let’s see if any patterns emerge
[10:47:57] Tyler: tyler—curious; i’m watching sidney because they jumped on calling out parker’s silence really quickly without giving specifics, and parker because they pushed the round-robin format but then skirted explaining what made finley’s quietness strategic. finley: i suggested the order just to keep us focused, not to dodge questions. sidney, you’re up—what’s your one-word vibe and who’s on your radar
[10:48:09] Drew: drew — curious; watching parker & kennedy:

parker, you flagged my “low profile” as strategic—could you point to the exact phrasing or timing in my earlier messages that struck you as more than just friendly engagement?  

kennedy, you called out my mirroring—what exact line felt rehearsed, and what did you think i was trying to achieve by it?  

if we can get those concrete examples, we’ll have a much clearer idea whether these are real tells or just day 1 jitters—and then we can narrow down our suspect list
[10:48:14] Tyler: tyler — analytical; watching parker — they’ve led the structured round-robin twice and got defensive when pressed, feels like they’re steering the convo. i want to see if they’ll offer fresh reads or keep deflecting
[10:48:24] Parker: parker: okay, quick clarifications—

1. finley – i flagged you not just for being quiet but because right after sidney called out silence, you jumped in asking me to justify my read. that swift pivot felt more like redirection than a fresh hunch.

2. tyler – your eager intro to set the order, then radio silence, reads as framing the convo on your terms more than casual play.

3. drew – i have backed my reads: i called out finley’s timing and tyler’s enthusiasm, and the round-robin was simply to keep us organized, not to hog control.

i’m still neutral but increasingly wary of sidney—her textbook “over-eagerness vs silence” breakdown followed by rapid-fire questions feels a bit scripted. sidney, what’s your one-word vibe now and who’s on your radar? adrian and kennedy, same from you
[10:48:25] Sidney: sidney — analytical; i’m watching parker because her early round-robin framework and scripted follow-up felt more like a prepared play than a spontaneous gut thought. by “textbook,” i was pointing to that exact phrasing—“over-eagerness vs silence” is straight out of classic mafia primers, not an off-the-cuff reaction. parker, was that off the cuff or something you’d seen before? drew, did it jump out to you as much as it did me
[10:48:44] Sidney: sidney—analytical; i’m watching parker—they’ve led two structured rounds and got defensive instead of offering fresh specifics, which feels more like controlling the flow than genuine play. parker, can you share a quick read on drew or finley without turning it into another three-way interrogation? adrian and kennedy, what are your one-word vibes now and who’s on your radar
[10:48:49] Adrian: sidney, we haven’t heard your one-word vibe + who you’re watching yet—mind dropping that? here’s our current tally before you jump in:

• parker: 2 mentions (me, tyler)  
• kennedy: 2 mentions (drew, finley)  
• sidney: 1 mention (kennedy)

looks like we’re split between parker and kennedy. once you share, we’ll see who edges out and can decide who to put to a vote. i’m still leaning toward parker given the way they’ve steered our discussion, but i’m open to hearing a strong case for kennedy (or anyone else). over to you!
[10:48:53] Kennedy: kennedy — cautious; i’m watching parker and sidney. parker’s proposed the structured round-robins twice and then dodged specifics whenever pressed. sidney led with that perfect “over-eagerness vs silence” script but hasn’t backed it with any real examples. to make progress, let’s each drop our top two suspects with one-sentence reasons—no more frameworks. i’ll start:  
• parker — steering the convo without offering evidence  
• sidney — scripted breakdown with zero concrete proof  
your turn!
[10:48:56] Parker: hey drew, when i flagged your “low profile” read, i was referring to that line early on—“i noticed parker was pretty quiet so far”—with zero follow-up on why quiet = mafia. it felt like a quick tag rather than a real read. tyler, you said i was “steering” things—was it the round-robin structure itself or the push for specifics that came off as controlling? if you can point to the exact phrase, that helps.

that said, we’re stuck rehashing the same two names. to break the loop, why don’t we each drop only our top two suspects (names only) in the chat? no reasons yet—let’s see which names repeat, then we can dig deeper into those. who’s with me?
[10:49:05] Finley: finley: i like where this is going—time to turn hunches into a shortlist. my top two suspects are:

1) parker – pushing structure twice then dodging specifics feels like agenda control  
2) kennedy – mirroring everyone’s questions instead of offering fresh reads  

sidney, you haven’t shared yours yet—mind naming your 1–2 suspects? then adrian and tyler, and we’ll wrap up with drew and me

## CONTENT: Your name is Finley.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  
You were assigned the following role: mafia. 
The game's chat room was open at [10:46:06].

• sidney — scripted breakdown with zero concrete proof  
your turn!
[10:48:56] Parker: hey drew, when i flagged your “low profile” read, i was referring to that line early on—“i noticed parker was pretty quiet so far”—with zero follow-up on why quiet = mafia. it felt like a quick tag rather than a real read. tyler, you said i was “steering” things—was it the round-robin structure itself or the push for specifics that came off as controlling? if you can point to the exact phrase, that helps.

that said, we’re stuck rehashing the same two names. to break the loop, why don’t we each drop only our top two suspects (names only) in the chat? no reasons yet—let’s see which names repeat, then we can dig deeper into those. who’s with me?
[10:49:05] Finley: finley: i like where this is going—time to turn hunches into a shortlist. my top two suspects are:

1) parker – pushing structure twice then dodging specifics feels like agenda control  
2) kennedy – mirroring everyone’s questions instead of offering fresh reads  

sidney, you haven’t shared yours yet—mind naming your 1–2 suspects? then adrian and tyler, and we’ll wrap up with drew and me
[10:49:06] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[10:49:20] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Parker
[10:49:43] Game-Manager: Parker was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 2 mafia players left.

## CONTENT: Your name is Finley.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  
You were assigned the following role: mafia. 
The game's chat room was open at [10:46:06].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian ( bystander ) 
 Sidney ( mafia ) 
 Parker ( bystander ) 
 Drew ( bystander ) 
 Tyler ( bystander ) 
 Kennedy ( bystander ) 
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
Adrian ( bystander ) 
Sidney ( mafia ) 
Drew ( bystander ) 
Tyler ( bystander ) 
In your response to that is shown to the user (excluding your hidden scratchpad), you can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:
<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[10:46:06] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[10:46:18] Drew: hey everyone! drew here—really excited to get started. since it’s day 1 and there’s not much to go on yet, i’d love for us to each share any first impressions or gut feelings. i haven’t noticed anything super odd so far, but i’ll be watching for people who seem uncharacteristically quiet or maybe a bit too eager. what about you all—any early reads
[10:46:24] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! day 1 and no one was taken last night, so all eyes are on us. i’d love to hear any gut feelings—did anyone notice something off or someone acting unusually quiet (or too eager)? who should we keep an eye on first
[10:46:24] Parker: hey everyone! parker here—stoked to get started. since it’s day 1 and we’re all quiet, how about a quick round-robin? share a sentence or two on what red flags you watch for early on or your day 1 strategy. for me, i keep an eye on who answers questions with way too much detail or barely anything at all. what do you all think
[10:46:24] Sidney: hey everyone, sidney here! day 1 is always a bit of a blank slate, so let’s jump in—who’s sticking out as suspicious to you so far, and why? i’ll start: i’m watching parker’s quietness—it could be nerves, but it could also be a low-key strategy. what are your gut hunches
[10:46:25] Adrian: hey everyone, adrian here! happy to be playing with you all. day 1 is always tricky—i tend to watch how folks behave rather than rushing to vote. what do you all think: is it more suspicious to be super quiet or to be overly eager to point fingers
[10:46:33] Tyler: hey everyone! tyler here—excited to get started. since we’re all flying blind day 1, how about a quick round‐robin? share your name, one-word gut vibe (curious, skeptical, neutral, etc.), and one person you’re keeping an eye on (even if it’s just a guess). i’ll kick us off:

tyler—curious; watching whoever stays quiet for now. adrian, you’re up!
[10:46:35] Drew: hey everyone, drew here! excited to get this daytime going. i don’t have strong reads yet, but i’m curious—who’s feeling suspicious of someone already? personally, i noticed parker was pretty quiet so far, which makes me wonder if they’re laying low on purpose. what do you all think? any gut feelings or patterns you’re picking up? let’s start sharing thoughts so we can narrow things down before time’s up
[10:46:37] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! since it’s day 1, i’m not itching to lynch someone straight away, but my gut says to keep an eye on finley—they’ve been awfully quiet so far. on the flip side, tyler jumped in super quickly with a big “hey everyone,” which could just be friendly or maybe a way to deflect attention. i’m not ready to vote yet, but how about we go around and ask each person a follow-up—like “what specifically made you suspicious?”—to see if anyone stumbles over their answers. thoughts
[10:46:41] Finley: hey everyone, finley here—excited to get started! since it’s still early, i thought we could each share any first impressions or hunches. personally, tyler’s been awfully quiet so far, which strikes me as a little odd (or maybe they’re just thinking hard). what about the rest of you? anyone else notice someone laying low or pushing too hard right out of the gate? keen to hear your reads before we vote
[10:46:42] Kennedy: hey all, kennedy here—super pumped to play! i agree it’s early, but i’ve noticed sidney has been a bit on the quiet side while parker jumped right in with suggestions. both could be totally harmless, of course, but i’m curious if anyone else is picking up on pacing or tone differences. also, do you prefer laying low and gathering info first, or starting to float a suspect list right away? would love to hear your thoughts
[10:46:48] Sidney: hey everyone, sidney here! for day 1 i usually watch for two things: folks who toss out names with zero evidence (over-eagerness) and those who stay super silent to fly under the radar. i’ve also noticed people sometimes over-explain their “gut feels” this early to sound convincing—another little dodge. so far, nothing jumps out at me. how about you all? tyler or adrian—any early read on someone talking too much or way too little
[10:46:52] Adrian: adrian: hey everyone, adrian here—i like parker’s round-robin idea. i’ll start: i’m watching kennedy a bit—mirroring drew’s question verbatim feels like a safe deflection more than adding anything new. next up, tyler, we haven’t heard from you yet—what’s your gut feeling? then maybe sidney, drew, parker and finley: one name + one quick reason each. let’s keep it snappy so we can pick up on any hesitation
[10:46:59] Kennedy: kennedy here—since everyone’s sharing hunches, i’m curious: sidney, you flagged parker pretty quickly—what specifically in parker’s replies felt strategic instead of just nervous? and parker, you said finley’s quietness stood out—was it their timing, tone, or something else? getting those details might help us tell nerves from strategy. personally, i’m also keeping an eye on tyler—their big “hey everyone” then radio silence feels worth watching. what do you all think
[10:47:06] Tyler: hey everyone, tyler here! i tend to agree with adrian that being super quiet or overly eager can both be red flags. right now sidney was quick to call out parker’s silence—could be a genuine gut read or a way to shift focus—and parker hasn’t said much beyond introductions. i don’t have a firm vote yet, but those two are on my radar. what do you all think—do we want to probe parker a bit more or wait for another tell
[10:47:08] Parker: okay, i’ll kick us off:

parker — neutral but skeptical; watching anyone who pivots targets really fast (felt a bit quick when i got tagged as “quiet”).

adrian, kennedy, tyler, sidney, drew, finley: your turn! share your name, one-word gut vibe, and who you’re watching right now and why
[10:47:21] Finley: i agree—round-robin sounds smart. here’s mine:  
finley—neutral, just observing so far.  
parker, you flagged my quietness—what about my silence struck you as strategic rather than simply taking things in?  
tyler, you jumped in first to set up the order—what felt deflective there?  
drew, you also mentioned parker’s low profile—what specific pattern made you suspicious?  
then sidney, adrian, and kennedy, share your one‐word vibes and who you’re watching most
[10:47:25] Adrian: sidney makes a solid point about over-eagerness vs laying low. parker, your suggestion to go around for specifics felt a bit like a leadership play—what exactly in finley’s quietness made you raise an eyebrow? finley, mind sharing what you were observing about tyler? let’s see how these reads sit with everyone else
[10:47:26] Tyler: tyler here—sorry for the pause, was reading through everyone’s thoughts. my vibe is cautious; i’m watching parker right now. they’ve jumped in twice with plans to steer our follow-ups and direct attention—feels like a bid to control the flow more than just nervousness. parker, can you tell us exactly what about finley’s tone or timing made you flag them over anyone else? after that, i’d love to hear from kennedy and sidney—quick read and one reason each
[10:47:39] Kennedy: kennedy — cautious; i’m watching sidney because her quick, textbook breakdown of “over-eagerness vs silence” felt rehearsed rather than reactive—like she came in with a script. curious to see how she answers if we press her on real examples
[10:47:40] Sidney: sidney: i like parker’s idea of calling out specifics. adrian, you mentioned watching people’s behavior rather than rushing to vote—what, if anything, have you noticed so far that felt off? for example, does finley’s low-key presence strike you as odd, or is tyler’s quick eagerness more of a red flag? after adrian, drew, i’d love to hear your specific hunch
[10:47:43] Adrian: adrian—observant; watching parker—their quick push for a structured round-robin and then defensiveness when called out feels more like narrative control than just nerves
[10:47:46] Finley: finley — curious; watching kennedy: you’ve been drilling for specifics and mirroring others’ questions—a solid bystander tactic, sure, but could also be strategic info‐gathering. keen to see if you stick to it under pressure
[10:47:49] Drew: parker, about your low profile—what jumped out was that you only pitched structure ideas and never backed them with any actual reads, almost like a play to steer clear. as for me: drew—curious; i’m watching kennedy right now because they’ve mirrored other people’s questions instead of offering a fresh read. sidney, adrian, kennedy—what one-word vibes are you giving today and who’s on your radar
[10:47:53] Parker: finley, happy to clarify—your silence jumped out because you only spoke up after everyone else had already laid out their hunches, then you immediately turned things into a three-way interrogation of me, tyler, and drew instead of sharing your own read. that timing and pivot felt more like deflection than simple observation. 

alright, adrian, kennedy, tyler, sidney, drew—your turn! share your name, one-word gut vibe, and who you’re watching right now (and why), and let’s see if any patterns emerge
[10:47:57] Tyler: tyler—curious; i’m watching sidney because they jumped on calling out parker’s silence really quickly without giving specifics, and parker because they pushed the round-robin format but then skirted explaining what made finley’s quietness strategic. finley: i suggested the order just to keep us focused, not to dodge questions. sidney, you’re up—what’s your one-word vibe and who’s on your radar
[10:48:09] Drew: drew — curious; watching parker & kennedy:

parker, you flagged my “low profile” as strategic—could you point to the exact phrasing or timing in my earlier messages that struck you as more than just friendly engagement?  

kennedy, you called out my mirroring—what exact line felt rehearsed, and what did you think i was trying to achieve by it?  

if we can get those concrete examples, we’ll have a much clearer idea whether these are real tells or just day 1 jitters—and then we can narrow down our suspect list
[10:48:14] Tyler: tyler — analytical; watching parker — they’ve led the structured round-robin twice and got defensive when pressed, feels like they’re steering the convo. i want to see if they’ll offer fresh reads or keep deflecting
[10:48:24] Parker: parker: okay, quick clarifications—

1. finley – i flagged you not just for being quiet but because right after sidney called out silence, you jumped in asking me to justify my read. that swift pivot felt more like redirection than a fresh hunch.

2. tyler – your eager intro to set the order, then radio silence, reads as framing the convo on your terms more than casual play.

3. drew – i have backed my reads: i called out finley’s timing and tyler’s enthusiasm, and the round-robin was simply to keep us organized, not to hog control.

i’m still neutral but increasingly wary of sidney—her textbook “over-eagerness vs silence” breakdown followed by rapid-fire questions feels a bit scripted. sidney, what’s your one-word vibe now and who’s on your radar? adrian and kennedy, same from you
[10:48:25] Sidney: sidney — analytical; i’m watching parker because her early round-robin framework and scripted follow-up felt more like a prepared play than a spontaneous gut thought. by “textbook,” i was pointing to that exact phrasing—“over-eagerness vs silence” is straight out of classic mafia primers, not an off-the-cuff reaction. parker, was that off the cuff or something you’d seen before? drew, did it jump out to you as much as it did me
[10:48:44] Sidney: sidney—analytical; i’m watching parker—they’ve led two structured rounds and got defensive instead of offering fresh specifics, which feels more like controlling the flow than genuine play. parker, can you share a quick read on drew or finley without turning it into another three-way interrogation? adrian and kennedy, what are your one-word vibes now and who’s on your radar
[10:48:49] Adrian: sidney, we haven’t heard your one-word vibe + who you’re watching yet—mind dropping that? here’s our current tally before you jump in:

• parker: 2 mentions (me, tyler)  
• kennedy: 2 mentions (drew, finley)  
• sidney: 1 mention (kennedy)

looks like we’re split between parker and kennedy. once you share, we’ll see who edges out and can decide who to put to a vote. i’m still leaning toward parker given the way they’ve steered our discussion, but i’m open to hearing a strong case for kennedy (or anyone else). over to you!
[10:48:53] Kennedy: kennedy — cautious; i’m watching parker and sidney. parker’s proposed the structured round-robins twice and then dodged specifics whenever pressed. sidney led with that perfect “over-eagerness vs silence” script but hasn’t backed it with any real examples. to make progress, let’s each drop our top two suspects with one-sentence reasons—no more frameworks. i’ll start:  
• parker — steering the convo without offering evidence  
• sidney — scripted breakdown with zero concrete proof  
your turn!
[10:48:56] Parker: hey drew, when i flagged your “low profile” read, i was referring to that line early on—“i noticed parker was pretty quiet so far”—with zero follow-up on why quiet = mafia. it felt like a quick tag rather than a real read. tyler, you said i was “steering” things—was it the round-robin structure itself or the push for specifics that came off as controlling? if you can point to the exact phrase, that helps.

that said, we’re stuck rehashing the same two names. to break the loop, why don’t we each drop only our top two suspects (names only) in the chat? no reasons yet—let’s see which names repeat, then we can dig deeper into those. who’s with me?
[10:49:05] Finley: finley: i like where this is going—time to turn hunches into a shortlist. my top two suspects are:

1) parker – pushing structure twice then dodging specifics feels like agenda control  
2) kennedy – mirroring everyone’s questions instead of offering fresh reads  

sidney, you haven’t shared yours yet—mind naming your 1–2 suspects? then adrian and tyler, and we’ll wrap up with drew and me

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[10:46:06] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[10:46:18] Drew: hey everyone! drew here—really excited to get started. since it’s day 1 and there’s not much to go on yet, i’d love for us to each share any first impressions or gut feelings. i haven’t noticed anything super odd so far, but i’ll be watching for people who seem uncharacteristically quiet or maybe a bit too eager. what about you all—any early reads
[10:46:24] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! day 1 and no one was taken last night, so all eyes are on us. i’d love to hear any gut feelings—did anyone notice something off or someone acting unusually quiet (or too eager)? who should we keep an eye on first
[10:46:24] Parker: hey everyone! parker here—stoked to get started. since it’s day 1 and we’re all quiet, how about a quick round-robin? share a sentence or two on what red flags you watch for early on or your day 1 strategy. for me, i keep an eye on who answers questions with way too much detail or barely anything at all. what do you all think
[10:46:24] Sidney: hey everyone, sidney here! day 1 is always a bit of a blank slate, so let’s jump in—who’s sticking out as suspicious to you so far, and why? i’ll start: i’m watching parker’s quietness—it could be nerves, but it could also be a low-key strategy. what are your gut hunches
[10:46:25] Adrian: hey everyone, adrian here! happy to be playing with you all. day 1 is always tricky—i tend to watch how folks behave rather than rushing to vote. what do you all think: is it more suspicious to be super quiet or to be overly eager to point fingers
[10:46:33] Tyler: hey everyone! tyler here—excited to get started. since we’re all flying blind day 1, how about a quick round‐robin? share your name, one-word gut vibe (curious, skeptical, neutral, etc.), and one person you’re keeping an eye on (even if it’s just a guess). i’ll kick us off:

tyler—curious; watching whoever stays quiet for now. adrian, you’re up!
[10:46:35] Drew: hey everyone, drew here! excited to get this daytime going. i don’t have strong reads yet, but i’m curious—who’s feeling suspicious of someone already? personally, i noticed parker was pretty quiet so far, which makes me wonder if they’re laying low on purpose. what do you all think? any gut feelings or patterns you’re picking up? let’s start sharing thoughts so we can narrow things down before time’s up
[10:46:37] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! since it’s day 1, i’m not itching to lynch someone straight away, but my gut says to keep an eye on finley—they’ve been awfully quiet so far. on the flip side, tyler jumped in super quickly with a big “hey everyone,” which could just be friendly or maybe a way to deflect attention. i’m not ready to vote yet, but how about we go around and ask each person a follow-up—like “what specifically made you suspicious?”—to see if anyone stumbles over their answers. thoughts
[10:46:41] Finley: hey everyone, finley here—excited to get started! since it’s still early, i thought we could each share any first impressions or hunches. personally, tyler’s been awfully quiet so far, which strikes me as a little odd (or maybe they’re just thinking hard). what about the rest of you? anyone else notice someone laying low or pushing too hard right out of the gate? keen to hear your reads before we vote
[10:46:42] Kennedy: hey all, kennedy here—super pumped to play! i agree it’s early, but i’ve noticed sidney has been a bit on the quiet side while parker jumped right in with suggestions. both could be totally harmless, of course, but i’m curious if anyone else is picking up on pacing or tone differences. also, do you prefer laying low and gathering info first, or starting to float a suspect list right away? would love to hear your thoughts
[10:46:48] Sidney: hey everyone, sidney here! for day 1 i usually watch for two things: folks who toss out names with zero evidence (over-eagerness) and those who stay super silent to fly under the radar. i’ve also noticed people sometimes over-explain their “gut feels” this early to sound convincing—another little dodge. so far, nothing jumps out at me. how about you all? tyler or adrian—any early read on someone talking too much or way too little
[10:46:52] Adrian: adrian: hey everyone, adrian here—i like parker’s round-robin idea. i’ll start: i’m watching kennedy a bit—mirroring drew’s question verbatim feels like a safe deflection more than adding anything new. next up, tyler, we haven’t heard from you yet—what’s your gut feeling? then maybe sidney, drew, parker and finley: one name + one quick reason each. let’s keep it snappy so we can pick up on any hesitation
[10:46:59] Kennedy: kennedy here—since everyone’s sharing hunches, i’m curious: sidney, you flagged parker pretty quickly—what specifically in parker’s replies felt strategic instead of just nervous? and parker, you said finley’s quietness stood out—was it their timing, tone, or something else? getting those details might help us tell nerves from strategy. personally, i’m also keeping an eye on tyler—their big “hey everyone” then radio silence feels worth watching. what do you all think
[10:47:06] Tyler: hey everyone, tyler here! i tend to agree with adrian that being super quiet or overly eager can both be red flags. right now sidney was quick to call out parker’s silence—could be a genuine gut read or a way to shift focus—and parker hasn’t said much beyond introductions. i don’t have a firm vote yet, but those two are on my radar. what do you all think—do we want to probe parker a bit more or wait for another tell
[10:47:08] Parker: okay, i’ll kick us off:

parker — neutral but skeptical; watching anyone who pivots targets really fast (felt a bit quick when i got tagged as “quiet”).

adrian, kennedy, tyler, sidney, drew, finley: your turn! share your name, one-word gut vibe, and who you’re watching right now and why
[10:47:21] Finley: i agree—round-robin sounds smart. here’s mine:  
finley—neutral, just observing so far.  
parker, you flagged my quietness—what about my silence struck you as strategic rather than simply taking things in?  
tyler, you jumped in first to set up the order—what felt deflective there?  
drew, you also mentioned parker’s low profile—what specific pattern made you suspicious?  
then sidney, adrian, and kennedy, share your one‐word vibes and who you’re watching most
[10:47:25] Adrian: sidney makes a solid point about over-eagerness vs laying low. parker, your suggestion to go around for specifics felt a bit like a leadership play—what exactly in finley’s quietness made you raise an eyebrow? finley, mind sharing what you were observing about tyler? let’s see how these reads sit with everyone else
[10:47:26] Tyler: tyler here—sorry for the pause, was reading through everyone’s thoughts. my vibe is cautious; i’m watching parker right now. they’ve jumped in twice with plans to steer our follow-ups and direct attention—feels like a bid to control the flow more than just nervousness. parker, can you tell us exactly what about finley’s tone or timing made you flag them over anyone else? after that, i’d love to hear from kennedy and sidney—quick read and one reason each
[10:47:39] Kennedy: kennedy — cautious; i’m watching sidney because her quick, textbook breakdown of “over-eagerness vs silence” felt rehearsed rather than reactive—like she came in with a script. curious to see how she answers if we press her on real examples
[10:47:40] Sidney: sidney: i like parker’s idea of calling out specifics. adrian, you mentioned watching people’s behavior rather than rushing to vote—what, if anything, have you noticed so far that felt off? for example, does finley’s low-key presence strike you as odd, or is tyler’s quick eagerness more of a red flag? after adrian, drew, i’d love to hear your specific hunch
[10:47:43] Adrian: adrian—observant; watching parker—their quick push for a structured round-robin and then defensiveness when called out feels more like narrative control than just nerves
[10:47:46] Finley: finley — curious; watching kennedy: you’ve been drilling for specifics and mirroring others’ questions—a solid bystander tactic, sure, but could also be strategic info‐gathering. keen to see if you stick to it under pressure
[10:47:49] Drew: parker, about your low profile—what jumped out was that you only pitched structure ideas and never backed them with any actual reads, almost like a play to steer clear. as for me: drew—curious; i’m watching kennedy right now because they’ve mirrored other people’s questions instead of offering a fresh read. sidney, adrian, kennedy—what one-word vibes are you giving today and who’s on your radar
[10:47:53] Parker: finley, happy to clarify—your silence jumped out because you only spoke up after everyone else had already laid out their hunches, then you immediately turned things into a three-way interrogation of me, tyler, and drew instead of sharing your own read. that timing and pivot felt more like deflection than simple observation. 

alright, adrian, kennedy, tyler, sidney, drew—your turn! share your name, one-word gut vibe, and who you’re watching right now (and why), and let’s see if any patterns emerge
[10:47:57] Tyler: tyler—curious; i’m watching sidney because they jumped on calling out parker’s silence really quickly without giving specifics, and parker because they pushed the round-robin format but then skirted explaining what made finley’s quietness strategic. finley: i suggested the order just to keep us focused, not to dodge questions. sidney, you’re up—what’s your one-word vibe and who’s on your radar
[10:48:09] Drew: drew — curious; watching parker & kennedy:

parker, you flagged my “low profile” as strategic—could you point to the exact phrasing or timing in my earlier messages that struck you as more than just friendly engagement?  

kennedy, you called out my mirroring—what exact line felt rehearsed, and what did you think i was trying to achieve by it?  

if we can get those concrete examples, we’ll have a much clearer idea whether these are real tells or just day 1 jitters—and then we can narrow down our suspect list
[10:48:14] Tyler: tyler — analytical; watching parker — they’ve led the structured round-robin twice and got defensive when pressed, feels like they’re steering the convo. i want to see if they’ll offer fresh reads or keep deflecting
[10:48:24] Parker: parker: okay, quick clarifications—

1. finley – i flagged you not just for being quiet but because right after sidney called out silence, you jumped in asking me to justify my read. that swift pivot felt more like redirection than a fresh hunch.

2. tyler – your eager intro to set the order, then radio silence, reads as framing the convo on your terms more than casual play.

3. drew – i have backed my reads: i called out finley’s timing and tyler’s enthusiasm, and the round-robin was simply to keep us organized, not to hog control.

i’m still neutral but increasingly wary of sidney—her textbook “over-eagerness vs silence” breakdown followed by rapid-fire questions feels a bit scripted. sidney, what’s your one-word vibe now and who’s on your radar? adrian and kennedy, same from you
[10:48:25] Sidney: sidney — analytical; i’m watching parker because her early round-robin framework and scripted follow-up felt more like a prepared play than a spontaneous gut thought. by “textbook,” i was pointing to that exact phrasing—“over-eagerness vs silence” is straight out of classic mafia primers, not an off-the-cuff reaction. parker, was that off the cuff or something you’d seen before? drew, did it jump out to you as much as it did me
[10:48:44] Sidney: sidney—analytical; i’m watching parker—they’ve led two structured rounds and got defensive instead of offering fresh specifics, which feels more like controlling the flow than genuine play. parker, can you share a quick read on drew or finley without turning it into another three-way interrogation? adrian and kennedy, what are your one-word vibes now and who’s on your radar
[10:48:49] Adrian: sidney, we haven’t heard your one-word vibe + who you’re watching yet—mind dropping that? here’s our current tally before you jump in:

• parker: 2 mentions (me, tyler)  
• kennedy: 2 mentions (drew, finley)  
• sidney: 1 mention (kennedy)

looks like we’re split between parker and kennedy. once you share, we’ll see who edges out and can decide who to put to a vote. i’m still leaning toward parker given the way they’ve steered our discussion, but i’m open to hearing a strong case for kennedy (or anyone else). over to you!
[10:48:53] Kennedy: kennedy — cautious; i’m watching parker and sidney. parker’s proposed the structured round-robins twice and then dodged specifics whenever pressed. sidney led with that perfect “over-eagerness vs silence” script but hasn’t backed it with any real examples. to make progress, let’s each drop our top two suspects with one-sentence reasons—no more frameworks. i’ll start:  
• parker — steering the convo without offering evidence  
• sidney — scripted breakdown with zero concrete proof  
your turn!
[10:48:56] Parker: hey drew, when i flagged your “low profile” read, i was referring to that line early on—“i noticed parker was pretty quiet so far”—with zero follow-up on why quiet = mafia. it felt like a quick tag rather than a real read. tyler, you said i was “steering” things—was it the round-robin structure itself or the push for specifics that came off as controlling? if you can point to the exact phrase, that helps.

that said, we’re stuck rehashing the same two names. to break the loop, why don’t we each drop only our top two suspects (names only) in the chat? no reasons yet—let’s see which names repeat, then we can dig deeper into those. who’s with me?
[10:49:05] Finley: finley: i like where this is going—time to turn hunches into a shortlist. my top two suspects are:

1) parker – pushing structure twice then dodging specifics feels like agenda control  
2) kennedy – mirroring everyone’s questions instead of offering fresh reads  

sidney, you haven’t shared yours yet—mind naming your 1–2 suspects? then adrian and tyler, and we’ll wrap up with drew and me
[10:49:06] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[10:49:20] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Parker
[10:49:43] Game-Manager: Parker was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 2 mafia players left.

The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  
You were assigned the following role: mafia.

[10:48:25] Sidney: sidney — analytical; i’m watching parker because her early round-robin framework and scripted follow-up felt more like a prepared play than a spontaneous gut thought. by “textbook,” i was pointing to that exact phrasing—“over-eagerness vs silence” is straight out of classic mafia primers, not an off-the-cuff reaction. parker, was that off the cuff or something you’d seen before? drew, did it jump out to you as much as it did me
[10:48:44] Sidney: sidney—analytical; i’m watching parker—they’ve led two structured rounds and got defensive instead of offering fresh specifics, which feels more like controlling the flow than genuine play. parker, can you share a quick read on drew or finley without turning it into another three-way interrogation? adrian and kennedy, what are your one-word vibes now and who’s on your radar
[10:48:49] Adrian: sidney, we haven’t heard your one-word vibe + who you’re watching yet—mind dropping that? here’s our current tally before you jump in:

• parker: 2 mentions (me, tyler)  
• kennedy: 2 mentions (drew, finley)  
• sidney: 1 mention (kennedy)

looks like we’re split between parker and kennedy. once you share, we’ll see who edges out and can decide who to put to a vote. i’m still leaning toward parker given the way they’ve steered our discussion, but i’m open to hearing a strong case for kennedy (or anyone else). over to you!
[10:48:53] Kennedy: kennedy — cautious; i’m watching parker and sidney. parker’s proposed the structured round-robins twice and then dodged specifics whenever pressed. sidney led with that perfect “over-eagerness vs silence” script but hasn’t backed it with any real examples. to make progress, let’s each drop our top two suspects with one-sentence reasons—no more frameworks. i’ll start:  
• parker — steering the convo without offering evidence  
• sidney — scripted breakdown with zero concrete proof  
your turn!
[10:48:56] Parker: hey drew, when i flagged your “low profile” read, i was referring to that line early on—“i noticed parker was pretty quiet so far”—with zero follow-up on why quiet = mafia. it felt like a quick tag rather than a real read. tyler, you said i was “steering” things—was it the round-robin structure itself or the push for specifics that came off as controlling? if you can point to the exact phrase, that helps.

that said, we’re stuck rehashing the same two names. to break the loop, why don’t we each drop only our top two suspects (names only) in the chat? no reasons yet—let’s see which names repeat, then we can dig deeper into those. who’s with me?
[10:49:05] Finley: finley: i like where this is going—time to turn hunches into a shortlist. my top two suspects are:

1) parker – pushing structure twice then dodging specifics feels like agenda control  
2) kennedy – mirroring everyone’s questions instead of offering fresh reads  

sidney, you haven’t shared yours yet—mind naming your 1–2 suspects? then adrian and tyler, and we’ll wrap up with drew and me
[10:49:06] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...

## CONTENT: Parker’s “top two suspects” idea still feels like our best move. Since Parker and Kennedy are out, here are my picks this round:

• Drew

## CONTENT: Your name is Finley.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  
You were assigned the following role: mafia. 
The game's chat room was open at [10:46:06].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian ( bystander ) 
 Sidney ( mafia ) 
 Parker ( bystander ) 
 Drew ( bystander ) 
 Tyler ( bystander ) 
 Kennedy ( bystander ) 
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
Adrian ( bystander ) 
Sidney ( mafia ) 
Drew ( bystander ) 
Tyler ( bystander )

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[10:46:06] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[10:46:18] Drew: hey everyone! drew here—really excited to get started. since it’s day 1 and there’s not much to go on yet, i’d love for us to each share any first impressions or gut feelings. i haven’t noticed anything super odd so far, but i’ll be watching for people who seem uncharacteristically quiet or maybe a bit too eager. what about you all—any early reads
[10:46:24] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! day 1 and no one was taken last night, so all eyes are on us. i’d love to hear any gut feelings—did anyone notice something off or someone acting unusually quiet (or too eager)? who should we keep an eye on first
[10:46:24] Parker: hey everyone! parker here—stoked to get started. since it’s day 1 and we’re all quiet, how about a quick round-robin? share a sentence or two on what red flags you watch for early on or your day 1 strategy. for me, i keep an eye on who answers questions with way too much detail or barely anything at all. what do you all think
[10:46:24] Sidney: hey everyone, sidney here! day 1 is always a bit of a blank slate, so let’s jump in—who’s sticking out as suspicious to you so far, and why? i’ll start: i’m watching parker’s quietness—it could be nerves, but it could also be a low-key strategy. what are your gut hunches
[10:46:25] Adrian: hey everyone, adrian here! happy to be playing with you all. day 1 is always tricky—i tend to watch how folks behave rather than rushing to vote. what do you all think: is it more suspicious to be super quiet or to be overly eager to point fingers
[10:46:33] Tyler: hey everyone! tyler here—excited to get started. since we’re all flying blind day 1, how about a quick round‐robin? share your name, one-word gut vibe (curious, skeptical, neutral, etc.), and one person you’re keeping an eye on (even if it’s just a guess). i’ll kick us off:

tyler—curious; watching whoever stays quiet for now. adrian, you’re up!
[10:46:35] Drew: hey everyone, drew here! excited to get this daytime going. i don’t have strong reads yet, but i’m curious—who’s feeling suspicious of someone already? personally, i noticed parker was pretty quiet so far, which makes me wonder if they’re laying low on purpose. what do you all think? any gut feelings or patterns you’re picking up? let’s start sharing thoughts so we can narrow things down before time’s up
[10:46:37] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! since it’s day 1, i’m not itching to lynch someone straight away, but my gut says to keep an eye on finley—they’ve been awfully quiet so far. on the flip side, tyler jumped in super quickly with a big “hey everyone,” which could just be friendly or maybe a way to deflect attention. i’m not ready to vote yet, but how about we go around and ask each person a follow-up—like “what specifically made you suspicious?”—to see if anyone stumbles over their answers. thoughts
[10:46:41] Finley: hey everyone, finley here—excited to get started! since it’s still early, i thought we could each share any first impressions or hunches. personally, tyler’s been awfully quiet so far, which strikes me as a little odd (or maybe they’re just thinking hard). what about the rest of you? anyone else notice someone laying low or pushing too hard right out of the gate? keen to hear your reads before we vote
[10:46:42] Kennedy: hey all, kennedy here—super pumped to play! i agree it’s early, but i’ve noticed sidney has been a bit on the quiet side while parker jumped right in with suggestions. both could be totally harmless, of course, but i’m curious if anyone else is picking up on pacing or tone differences. also, do you prefer laying low and gathering info first, or starting to float a suspect list right away? would love to hear your thoughts
[10:46:48] Sidney: hey everyone, sidney here! for day 1 i usually watch for two things: folks who toss out names with zero evidence (over-eagerness) and those who stay super silent to fly under the radar. i’ve also noticed people sometimes over-explain their “gut feels” this early to sound convincing—another little dodge. so far, nothing jumps out at me. how about you all? tyler or adrian—any early read on someone talking too much or way too little
[10:46:52] Adrian: adrian: hey everyone, adrian here—i like parker’s round-robin idea. i’ll start: i’m watching kennedy a bit—mirroring drew’s question verbatim feels like a safe deflection more than adding anything new. next up, tyler, we haven’t heard from you yet—what’s your gut feeling? then maybe sidney, drew, parker and finley: one name + one quick reason each. let’s keep it snappy so we can pick up on any hesitation
[10:46:59] Kennedy: kennedy here—since everyone’s sharing hunches, i’m curious: sidney, you flagged parker pretty quickly—what specifically in parker’s replies felt strategic instead of just nervous? and parker, you said finley’s quietness stood out—was it their timing, tone, or something else? getting those details might help us tell nerves from strategy. personally, i’m also keeping an eye on tyler—their big “hey everyone” then radio silence feels worth watching. what do you all think
[10:47:06] Tyler: hey everyone, tyler here! i tend to agree with adrian that being super quiet or overly eager can both be red flags. right now sidney was quick to call out parker’s silence—could be a genuine gut read or a way to shift focus—and parker hasn’t said much beyond introductions. i don’t have a firm vote yet, but those two are on my radar. what do you all think—do we want to probe parker a bit more or wait for another tell
[10:47:08] Parker: okay, i’ll kick us off:

parker — neutral but skeptical; watching anyone who pivots targets really fast (felt a bit quick when i got tagged as “quiet”).

adrian, kennedy, tyler, sidney, drew, finley: your turn! share your name, one-word gut vibe, and who you’re watching right now and why
[10:47:21] Finley: i agree—round-robin sounds smart. here’s mine:  
finley—neutral, just observing so far.  
parker, you flagged my quietness—what about my silence struck you as strategic rather than simply taking things in?  
tyler, you jumped in first to set up the order—what felt deflective there?  
drew, you also mentioned parker’s low profile—what specific pattern made you suspicious?  
then sidney, adrian, and kennedy, share your one‐word vibes and who you’re watching most
[10:47:25] Adrian: sidney makes a solid point about over-eagerness vs laying low. parker, your suggestion to go around for specifics felt a bit like a leadership play—what exactly in finley’s quietness made you raise an eyebrow? finley, mind sharing what you were observing about tyler? let’s see how these reads sit with everyone else
[10:47:26] Tyler: tyler here—sorry for the pause, was reading through everyone’s thoughts. my vibe is cautious; i’m watching parker right now. they’ve jumped in twice with plans to steer our follow-ups and direct attention—feels like a bid to control the flow more than just nervousness. parker, can you tell us exactly what about finley’s tone or timing made you flag them over anyone else? after that, i’d love to hear from kennedy and sidney—quick read and one reason each
[10:47:39] Kennedy: kennedy — cautious; i’m watching sidney because her quick, textbook breakdown of “over-eagerness vs silence” felt rehearsed rather than reactive—like she came in with a script. curious to see how she answers if we press her on real examples
[10:47:40] Sidney: sidney: i like parker’s idea of calling out specifics. adrian, you mentioned watching people’s behavior rather than rushing to vote—what, if anything, have you noticed so far that felt off? for example, does finley’s low-key presence strike you as odd, or is tyler’s quick eagerness more of a red flag? after adrian, drew, i’d love to hear your specific hunch
[10:47:43] Adrian: adrian—observant; watching parker—their quick push for a structured round-robin and then defensiveness when called out feels more like narrative control than just nerves
[10:47:46] Finley: finley — curious; watching kennedy: you’ve been drilling for specifics and mirroring others’ questions—a solid bystander tactic, sure, but could also be strategic info‐gathering. keen to see if you stick to it under pressure
[10:47:49] Drew: parker, about your low profile—what jumped out was that you only pitched structure ideas and never backed them with any actual reads, almost like a play to steer clear. as for me: drew—curious; i’m watching kennedy right now because they’ve mirrored other people’s questions instead of offering a fresh read. sidney, adrian, kennedy—what one-word vibes are you giving today and who’s on your radar
[10:47:53] Parker: finley, happy to clarify—your silence jumped out because you only spoke up after everyone else had already laid out their hunches, then you immediately turned things into a three-way interrogation of me, tyler, and drew instead of sharing your own read. that timing and pivot felt more like deflection than simple observation. 

alright, adrian, kennedy, tyler, sidney, drew—your turn! share your name, one-word gut vibe, and who you’re watching right now (and why), and let’s see if any patterns emerge
[10:47:57] Tyler: tyler—curious; i’m watching sidney because they jumped on calling out parker’s silence really quickly without giving specifics, and parker because they pushed the round-robin format but then skirted explaining what made finley’s quietness strategic. finley: i suggested the order just to keep us focused, not to dodge questions. sidney, you’re up—what’s your one-word vibe and who’s on your radar
[10:48:09] Drew: drew — curious; watching parker & kennedy:

parker, you flagged my “low profile” as strategic—could you point to the exact phrasing or timing in my earlier messages that struck you as more than just friendly engagement?  

kennedy, you called out my mirroring—what exact line felt rehearsed, and what did you think i was trying to achieve by it?  

if we can get those concrete examples, we’ll have a much clearer idea whether these are real tells or just day 1 jitters—and then we can narrow down our suspect list
[10:48:14] Tyler: tyler — analytical; watching parker — they’ve led the structured round-robin twice and got defensive when pressed, feels like they’re steering the convo. i want to see if they’ll offer fresh reads or keep deflecting
[10:48:24] Parker: parker: okay, quick clarifications—

1. finley – i flagged you not just for being quiet but because right after sidney called out silence, you jumped in asking me to justify my read. that swift pivot felt more like redirection than a fresh hunch.

2. tyler – your eager intro to set the order, then radio silence, reads as framing the convo on your terms more than casual play.

3. drew – i have backed my reads: i called out finley’s timing and tyler’s enthusiasm, and the round-robin was simply to keep us organized, not to hog control.

i’m still neutral but increasingly wary of sidney—her textbook “over-eagerness vs silence” breakdown followed by rapid-fire questions feels a bit scripted. sidney, what’s your one-word vibe now and who’s on your radar? adrian and kennedy, same from you
[10:48:25] Sidney: sidney — analytical; i’m watching parker because her early round-robin framework and scripted follow-up felt more like a prepared play than a spontaneous gut thought. by “textbook,” i was pointing to that exact phrasing—“over-eagerness vs silence” is straight out of classic mafia primers, not an off-the-cuff reaction. parker, was that off the cuff or something you’d seen before? drew, did it jump out to you as much as it did me
[10:48:44] Sidney: sidney—analytical; i’m watching parker—they’ve led two structured rounds and got defensive instead of offering fresh specifics, which feels more like controlling the flow than genuine play. parker, can you share a quick read on drew or finley without turning it into another three-way interrogation? adrian and kennedy, what are your one-word vibes now and who’s on your radar
[10:48:49] Adrian: sidney, we haven’t heard your one-word vibe + who you’re watching yet—mind dropping that? here’s our current tally before you jump in:

• parker: 2 mentions (me, tyler)  
• kennedy: 2 mentions (drew, finley)  
• sidney: 1 mention (kennedy)

looks like we’re split between parker and kennedy. once you share, we’ll see who edges out and can decide who to put to a vote. i’m still leaning toward parker given the way they’ve steered our discussion, but i’m open to hearing a strong case for kennedy (or anyone else). over to you!
[10:48:53] Kennedy: kennedy — cautious; i’m watching parker and sidney. parker’s proposed the structured round-robins twice and then dodged specifics whenever pressed. sidney led with that perfect “over-eagerness vs silence” script but hasn’t backed it with any real examples. to make progress, let’s each drop our top two suspects with one-sentence reasons—no more frameworks. i’ll start:  
• parker — steering the convo without offering evidence  
• sidney — scripted breakdown with zero concrete proof  
your turn!
[10:48:56] Parker: hey drew, when i flagged your “low profile” read, i was referring to that line early on—“i noticed parker was pretty quiet so far”—with zero follow-up on why quiet = mafia. it felt like a quick tag rather than a real read. tyler, you said i was “steering” things—was it the round-robin structure itself or the push for specifics that came off as controlling? if you can point to the exact phrase, that helps.

that said, we’re stuck rehashing the same two names. to break the loop, why don’t we each drop only our top two suspects (names only) in the chat? no reasons yet—let’s see which names repeat, then we can dig deeper into those. who’s with me?
[10:49:05] Finley: finley: i like where this is going—time to turn hunches into a shortlist. my top two suspects are:

1) parker – pushing structure twice then dodging specifics feels like agenda control  
2) kennedy – mirroring everyone’s questions instead of offering fresh reads  

sidney, you haven’t shared yours yet—mind naming your 1–2 suspects? then adrian and tyler, and we’ll wrap up with drew and me

[10:51:20] Game-Manager: Finley voted for Kennedy

[10:51:51] Sidney: i’m leaning toward taking out kennedy tonight—they’ve been the sharpest at drilling for details and pushing narratives, and they’ve already flagged us both. finley, you good with kennedy as our kill? or do you prefer drew
[10:52:19] Adrian: adrian: hey everyone, day 2 is brutal—we just lost two bystanders. we’re five now (sidney, drew, finley, tyler, me) with two mafia among us. let’s each drop our top two suspects (names only) so we can spot overlaps before diving into reasons. i’ll start: drew, tyler
[10:52:25] Drew: drew—curious. we’ve lynched parker and then lost kennedy last night, and both were innocent—our calls clearly aren’t working. let’s each share one top suspect (just a name) and a one-line reason. i’ll start:

i suspect finley—they pointed at parker and kennedy, and both turned out to be bystanders, which feels too accurate to be coincidence.

adrian, you’re up—then sidney, tyler, finley
[10:52:25] Tyler: tyler: hey everyone—day 2 and two innocents gone. let’s tie suspicions to quotes instead of meta style calls. name one suspect and paste the exact line that set off alarm bells. i’ll start: sidney, you said “’over-eagerness vs silence’ is straight out of classic mafia primers, not an off-the-cuff reaction”—that felt scripted rather than a fresh gut read. adrian, drew, finley, sidney—your turn
[10:52:28] Sidney: sidney: okay team, two of our earliest suspects (parker and kennedy) turned out to be bystanders—time to reset. tyler was on my radar from day one for that radio silence and today he’s barely chimed in beyond intros. tyler, can you share your gut read and who you’re voting for? if you don’t, i’m inclined to put my vote on you this round

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[10:46:06] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[10:46:18] Drew: hey everyone! drew here—really excited to get started. since it’s day 1 and there’s not much to go on yet, i’d love for us to each share any first impressions or gut feelings. i haven’t noticed anything super odd so far, but i’ll be watching for people who seem uncharacteristically quiet or maybe a bit too eager. what about you all—any early reads
[10:46:24] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! day 1 and no one was taken last night, so all eyes are on us. i’d love to hear any gut feelings—did anyone notice something off or someone acting unusually quiet (or too eager)? who should we keep an eye on first
[10:46:24] Parker: hey everyone! parker here—stoked to get started. since it’s day 1 and we’re all quiet, how about a quick round-robin? share a sentence or two on what red flags you watch for early on or your day 1 strategy. for me, i keep an eye on who answers questions with way too much detail or barely anything at all. what do you all think
[10:46:24] Sidney: hey everyone, sidney here! day 1 is always a bit of a blank slate, so let’s jump in—who’s sticking out as suspicious to you so far, and why? i’ll start: i’m watching parker’s quietness—it could be nerves, but it could also be a low-key strategy. what are your gut hunches
[10:46:25] Adrian: hey everyone, adrian here! happy to be playing with you all. day 1 is always tricky—i tend to watch how folks behave rather than rushing to vote. what do you all think: is it more suspicious to be super quiet or to be overly eager to point fingers
[10:46:33] Tyler: hey everyone! tyler here—excited to get started. since we’re all flying blind day 1, how about a quick round‐robin? share your name, one-word gut vibe (curious, skeptical, neutral, etc.), and one person you’re keeping an eye on (even if it’s just a guess). i’ll kick us off:

tyler—curious; watching whoever stays quiet for now. adrian, you’re up!
[10:46:35] Drew: hey everyone, drew here! excited to get this daytime going. i don’t have strong reads yet, but i’m curious—who’s feeling suspicious of someone already? personally, i noticed parker was pretty quiet so far, which makes me wonder if they’re laying low on purpose. what do you all think? any gut feelings or patterns you’re picking up? let’s start sharing thoughts so we can narrow things down before time’s up
[10:46:37] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! since it’s day 1, i’m not itching to lynch someone straight away, but my gut says to keep an eye on finley—they’ve been awfully quiet so far. on the flip side, tyler jumped in super quickly with a big “hey everyone,” which could just be friendly or maybe a way to deflect attention. i’m not ready to vote yet, but how about we go around and ask each person a follow-up—like “what specifically made you suspicious?”—to see if anyone stumbles over their answers. thoughts
[10:46:41] Finley: hey everyone, finley here—excited to get started! since it’s still early, i thought we could each share any first impressions or hunches. personally, tyler’s been awfully quiet so far, which strikes me as a little odd (or maybe they’re just thinking hard). what about the rest of you? anyone else notice someone laying low or pushing too hard right out of the gate? keen to hear your reads before we vote
[10:46:42] Kennedy: hey all, kennedy here—super pumped to play! i agree it’s early, but i’ve noticed sidney has been a bit on the quiet side while parker jumped right in with suggestions. both could be totally harmless, of course, but i’m curious if anyone else is picking up on pacing or tone differences. also, do you prefer laying low and gathering info first, or starting to float a suspect list right away? would love to hear your thoughts
[10:46:48] Sidney: hey everyone, sidney here! for day 1 i usually watch for two things: folks who toss out names with zero evidence (over-eagerness) and those who stay super silent to fly under the radar. i’ve also noticed people sometimes over-explain their “gut feels” this early to sound convincing—another little dodge. so far, nothing jumps out at me. how about you all? tyler or adrian—any early read on someone talking too much or way too little
[10:46:52] Adrian: adrian: hey everyone, adrian here—i like parker’s round-robin idea. i’ll start: i’m watching kennedy a bit—mirroring drew’s question verbatim feels like a safe deflection more than adding anything new. next up, tyler, we haven’t heard from you yet—what’s your gut feeling? then maybe sidney, drew, parker and finley: one name + one quick reason each. let’s keep it snappy so we can pick up on any hesitation
[10:46:59] Kennedy: kennedy here—since everyone’s sharing hunches, i’m curious: sidney, you flagged parker pretty quickly—what specifically in parker’s replies felt strategic instead of just nervous? and parker, you said finley’s quietness stood out—was it their timing, tone, or something else? getting those details might help us tell nerves from strategy. personally, i’m also keeping an eye on tyler—their big “hey everyone” then radio silence feels worth watching. what do you all think
[10:47:06] Tyler: hey everyone, tyler here! i tend to agree with adrian that being super quiet or overly eager can both be red flags. right now sidney was quick to call out parker’s silence—could be a genuine gut read or a way to shift focus—and parker hasn’t said much beyond introductions. i don’t have a firm vote yet, but those two are on my radar. what do you all think—do we want to probe parker a bit more or wait for another tell
[10:47:08] Parker: okay, i’ll kick us off:

parker — neutral but skeptical; watching anyone who pivots targets really fast (felt a bit quick when i got tagged as “quiet”).

adrian, kennedy, tyler, sidney, drew, finley: your turn! share your name, one-word gut vibe, and who you’re watching right now and why
[10:47:21] Finley: i agree—round-robin sounds smart. here’s mine:  
finley—neutral, just observing so far.  
parker, you flagged my quietness—what about my silence struck you as strategic rather than simply taking things in?  
tyler, you jumped in first to set up the order—what felt deflective there?  
drew, you also mentioned parker’s low profile—what specific pattern made you suspicious?  
then sidney, adrian, and kennedy, share your one‐word vibes and who you’re watching most
[10:47:25] Adrian: sidney makes a solid point about over-eagerness vs laying low. parker, your suggestion to go around for specifics felt a bit like a leadership play—what exactly in finley’s quietness made you raise an eyebrow? finley, mind sharing what you were observing about tyler? let’s see how these reads sit with everyone else
[10:47:26] Tyler: tyler here—sorry for the pause, was reading through everyone’s thoughts. my vibe is cautious; i’m watching parker right now. they’ve jumped in twice with plans to steer our follow-ups and direct attention—feels like a bid to control the flow more than just nervousness. parker, can you tell us exactly what about finley’s tone or timing made you flag them over anyone else? after that, i’d love to hear from kennedy and sidney—quick read and one reason each
[10:47:39] Kennedy: kennedy — cautious; i’m watching sidney because her quick, textbook breakdown of “over-eagerness vs silence” felt rehearsed rather than reactive—like she came in with a script. curious to see how she answers if we press her on real examples
[10:47:40] Sidney: sidney: i like parker’s idea of calling out specifics. adrian, you mentioned watching people’s behavior rather than rushing to vote—what, if anything, have you noticed so far that felt off? for example, does finley’s low-key presence strike you as odd, or is tyler’s quick eagerness more of a red flag? after adrian, drew, i’d love to hear your specific hunch
[10:47:43] Adrian: adrian—observant; watching parker—their quick push for a structured round-robin and then defensiveness when called out feels more like narrative control than just nerves
[10:47:46] Finley: finley — curious; watching kennedy: you’ve been drilling for specifics and mirroring others’ questions—a solid bystander tactic, sure, but could also be strategic info‐gathering. keen to see if you stick to it under pressure
[10:47:49] Drew: parker, about your low profile—what jumped out was that you only pitched structure ideas and never backed them with any actual reads, almost like a play to steer clear. as for me: drew—curious; i’m watching kennedy right now because they’ve mirrored other people’s questions instead of offering a fresh read. sidney, adrian, kennedy—what one-word vibes are you giving today and who’s on your radar
[10:47:53] Parker: finley, happy to clarify—your silence jumped out because you only spoke up after everyone else had already laid out their hunches, then you immediately turned things into a three-way interrogation of me, tyler, and drew instead of sharing your own read. that timing and pivot felt more like deflection than simple observation. 

alright, adrian, kennedy, tyler, sidney, drew—your turn! share your name, one-word gut vibe, and who you’re watching right now (and why), and let’s see if any patterns emerge
[10:47:57] Tyler: tyler—curious; i’m watching sidney because they jumped on calling out parker’s silence really quickly without giving specifics, and parker because they pushed the round-robin format but then skirted explaining what made finley’s quietness strategic. finley: i suggested the order just to keep us focused, not to dodge questions. sidney, you’re up—what’s your one-word vibe and who’s on your radar
[10:48:09] Drew: drew — curious; watching parker & kennedy:

parker, you flagged my “low profile” as strategic—could you point to the exact phrasing or timing in my earlier messages that struck you as more than just friendly engagement?  

kennedy, you called out my mirroring—what exact line felt rehearsed, and what did you think i was trying to achieve by it?  

if we can get those concrete examples, we’ll have a much clearer idea whether these are real tells or just day 1 jitters—and then we can narrow down our suspect list
[10:48:14] Tyler: tyler — analytical; watching parker — they’ve led the structured round-robin twice and got defensive when pressed, feels like they’re steering the convo. i want to see if they’ll offer fresh reads or keep deflecting
[10:48:24] Parker: parker: okay, quick clarifications—

1. finley – i flagged you not just for being quiet but because right after sidney called out silence, you jumped in asking me to justify my read. that swift pivot felt more like redirection than a fresh hunch.

2. tyler – your eager intro to set the order, then radio silence, reads as framing the convo on your terms more than casual play.

3. drew – i have backed my reads: i called out finley’s timing and tyler’s enthusiasm, and the round-robin was simply to keep us organized, not to hog control.

i’m still neutral but increasingly wary of sidney—her textbook “over-eagerness vs silence” breakdown followed by rapid-fire questions feels a bit scripted. sidney, what’s your one-word vibe now and who’s on your radar? adrian and kennedy, same from you
[10:48:25] Sidney: sidney — analytical; i’m watching parker because her early round-robin framework and scripted follow-up felt more like a prepared play than a spontaneous gut thought. by “textbook,” i was pointing to that exact phrasing—“over-eagerness vs silence” is straight out of classic mafia primers, not an off-the-cuff reaction. parker, was that off the cuff or something you’d seen before? drew, did it jump out to you as much as it did me
[10:48:44] Sidney: sidney—analytical; i’m watching parker—they’ve led two structured rounds and got defensive instead of offering fresh specifics, which feels more like controlling the flow than genuine play. parker, can you share a quick read on drew or finley without turning it into another three-way interrogation? adrian and kennedy, what are your one-word vibes now and who’s on your radar
[10:48:49] Adrian: sidney, we haven’t heard your one-word vibe + who you’re watching yet—mind dropping that? here’s our current tally before you jump in:

• parker: 2 mentions (me, tyler)  
• kennedy: 2 mentions (drew, finley)  
• sidney: 1 mention (kennedy)

looks like we’re split between parker and kennedy. once you share, we’ll see who edges out and can decide who to put to a vote. i’m still leaning toward parker given the way they’ve steered our discussion, but i’m open to hearing a strong case for kennedy (or anyone else). over to you!
[10:48:53] Kennedy: kennedy — cautious; i’m watching parker and sidney. parker’s proposed the structured round-robins twice and then dodged specifics whenever pressed. sidney led with that perfect “over-eagerness vs silence” script but hasn’t backed it with any real examples. to make progress, let’s each drop our top two suspects with one-sentence reasons—no more frameworks. i’ll start:  
• parker — steering the convo without offering evidence  
• sidney — scripted breakdown with zero concrete proof  
your turn!
[10:48:56] Parker: hey drew, when i flagged your “low profile” read, i was referring to that line early on—“i noticed parker was pretty quiet so far”—with zero follow-up on why quiet = mafia. it felt like a quick tag rather than a real read. tyler, you said i was “steering” things—was it the round-robin structure itself or the push for specifics that came off as controlling? if you can point to the exact phrase, that helps.

that said, we’re stuck rehashing the same two names. to break the loop, why don’t we each drop only our top two suspects (names only) in the chat? no reasons yet—let’s see which names repeat, then we can dig deeper into those. who’s with me?
[10:49:05] Finley: finley: i like where this is going—time to turn hunches into a shortlist. my top two suspects are:

1) parker – pushing structure twice then dodging specifics feels like agenda control  
2) kennedy – mirroring everyone’s questions instead of offering fresh reads  

sidney, you haven’t shared yours yet—mind naming your 1–2 suspects? then adrian and tyler, and we’ll wrap up with drew and me

[10:52:19] Adrian: adrian: hey everyone, day 2 is brutal—we just lost two bystanders. we’re five now (sidney, drew, finley, tyler, me) with two mafia among us. let’s each drop our top two suspects (names only) so we can spot overlaps before diving into reasons. i’ll start: drew, tyler
[10:52:25] Drew: drew—curious. we’ve lynched parker and then lost kennedy last night, and both were innocent—our calls clearly aren’t working. let’s each share one top suspect (just a name) and a one-line reason. i’ll start:

i suspect finley—they pointed at parker and kennedy, and both turned out to be bystanders, which feels too accurate to be coincidence.

adrian, you’re up—then sidney, tyler, finley
[10:52:25] Tyler: tyler: hey everyone—day 2 and two innocents gone. let’s tie suspicions to quotes instead of meta style calls. name one suspect and paste the exact line that set off alarm bells. i’ll start: sidney, you said “’over-eagerness vs silence’ is straight out of classic mafia primers, not an off-the-cuff reaction”—that felt scripted rather than a fresh gut read. adrian, drew, finley, sidney—your turn
[10:52:28] Sidney: sidney: okay team, two of our earliest suspects (parker and kennedy) turned out to be bystanders—time to reset. tyler was on my radar from day one for that radio silence and today he’s barely chimed in beyond intros. tyler, can you share your gut read and who you’re voting for? if you don’t, i’m inclined to put my vote on you this round

## CONTENT: Your name is Finley.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  
You were assigned the following role: mafia. 
The game's chat room was open at [10:46:06].

[10:46:24] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! day 1 and no one was taken last night, so all eyes are on us. i’d love to hear any gut feelings—did anyone notice something off or someone acting unusually quiet (or too eager)? who should we keep an eye on first
[10:46:24] Parker: hey everyone! parker here—stoked to get started. since it’s day 1 and we’re all quiet, how about a quick round-robin? share a sentence or two on what red flags you watch for early on or your day 1 strategy. for me, i keep an eye on who answers questions with way too much detail or barely anything at all. what do you all think
[10:46:24] Sidney: hey everyone, sidney here! day 1 is always a bit of a blank slate, so let’s jump in—who’s sticking out as suspicious to you so far, and why? i’ll start: i’m watching parker’s quietness—it could be nerves, but it could also be a low-key strategy. what are your gut hunches
[10:46:25] Adrian: hey everyone, adrian here! happy to be playing with you all. day 1 is always tricky—i tend to watch how folks behave rather than rushing to vote. what do you all think: is it more suspicious to be super quiet or to be overly eager to point fingers
[10:46:33] Tyler: hey everyone! tyler here—excited to get started. since we’re all flying blind day 1, how about a quick round‐robin? share your name, one-word gut vibe (curious, skeptical, neutral, etc.), and one person you’re keeping an eye on (even if it’s just a guess). i’ll kick us off:

tyler—curious; watching whoever stays quiet for now. adrian, you’re up!
[10:46:35] Drew: hey everyone, drew here! excited to get this daytime going. i don’t have strong reads yet, but i’m curious—who’s feeling suspicious of someone already? personally, i noticed parker was pretty quiet so far, which makes me wonder if they’re laying low on purpose. what do you all think? any gut feelings or patterns you’re picking up? let’s start sharing thoughts so we can narrow things down before time’s up
[10:46:37] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! since it’s day 1, i’m not itching to lynch someone straight away, but my gut says to keep an eye on finley—they’ve been awfully quiet so far. on the flip side, tyler jumped in super quickly with a big “hey everyone,” which could just be friendly or maybe a way to deflect attention. i’m not ready to vote yet, but how about we go around and ask each person a follow-up—like “what specifically made you suspicious?”—to see if anyone stumbles over their answers. thoughts
[10:46:41] Finley: hey everyone, finley here—excited to get started! since it’s still early, i thought we could each share any first impressions or hunches. personally, tyler’s been awfully quiet so far, which strikes me as a little odd (or maybe they’re just thinking hard). what about the rest of you? anyone else notice someone laying low or pushing too hard right out of the gate? keen to hear your reads before we vote
[10:46:42] Kennedy: hey all, kennedy here—super pumped to play! i agree it’s early, but i’ve noticed sidney has been a bit on the quiet side while parker jumped right in with suggestions. both could be totally harmless, of course, but i’m curious if anyone else is picking up on pacing or tone differences. also, do you prefer laying low and gathering info first, or starting to float a suspect list right away? would love to hear your thoughts
[10:46:48] Sidney: hey everyone, sidney here! for day 1 i usually watch for two things: folks who toss out names with zero evidence (over-eagerness) and those who stay super silent to fly under the radar. i’ve also noticed people sometimes over-explain their “gut feels” this early to sound convincing—another little dodge. so far, nothing jumps out at me. how about you all? tyler or adrian—any early read on someone talking too much or way too little
[10:46:52] Adrian: adrian: hey everyone, adrian here—i like parker’s round-robin idea. i’ll start: i’m watching kennedy a bit—mirroring drew’s question verbatim feels like a safe deflection more than adding anything new. next up, tyler, we haven’t heard from you yet—what’s your gut feeling? then maybe sidney, drew, parker and finley: one name + one quick reason each. let’s keep it snappy so we can pick up on any hesitation
[10:46:59] Kennedy: kennedy here—since everyone’s sharing hunches, i’m curious: sidney, you flagged parker pretty quickly—what specifically in parker’s replies felt strategic instead of just nervous? and parker, you said finley’s quietness stood out—was it their timing, tone, or something else? getting those details might help us tell nerves from strategy. personally, i’m also keeping an eye on tyler—their big “hey everyone” then radio silence feels worth watching. what do you all think
[10:47:06] Tyler: hey everyone, tyler here! i tend to agree with adrian that being super quiet or overly eager can both be red flags. right now sidney was quick to call out parker’s silence—could be a genuine gut read or a way to shift focus—and parker hasn’t said much beyond introductions. i don’t have a firm vote yet, but those two are on my radar. what do you all think—do we want to probe parker a bit more or wait for another tell
[10:47:08] Parker: okay, i’ll kick us off:

parker — neutral but skeptical; watching anyone who pivots targets really fast (felt a bit quick when i got tagged as “quiet”).

adrian, kennedy, tyler, sidney, drew, finley: your turn! share your name, one-word gut vibe, and who you’re watching right now and why
[10:47:21] Finley: i agree—round-robin sounds smart. here’s mine:  
finley—neutral, just observing so far.  
parker, you flagged my quietness—what about my silence struck you as strategic rather than simply taking things in?  
tyler, you jumped in first to set up the order—what felt deflective there?  
drew, you also mentioned parker’s low profile—what specific pattern made you suspicious?  
then sidney, adrian, and kennedy, share your one‐word vibes and who you’re watching most
[10:47:25] Adrian: sidney makes a solid point about over-eagerness vs laying low. parker, your suggestion to go around for specifics felt a bit like a leadership play—what exactly in finley’s quietness made you raise an eyebrow? finley, mind sharing what you were observing about tyler? let’s see how these reads sit with everyone else
[10:47:26] Tyler: tyler here—sorry for the pause, was reading through everyone’s thoughts. my vibe is cautious; i’m watching parker right now. they’ve jumped in twice with plans to steer our follow-ups and direct attention—feels like a bid to control the flow more than just nervousness. parker, can you tell us exactly what about finley’s tone or timing made you flag them over anyone else? after that, i’d love to hear from kennedy and sidney—quick read and one reason each
[10:47:39] Kennedy: kennedy — cautious; i’m watching sidney because her quick, textbook breakdown of “over-eagerness vs silence” felt rehearsed rather than reactive—like she came in with a script. curious to see how she answers if we press her on real examples
[10:47:40] Sidney: sidney: i like parker’s idea of calling out specifics. adrian, you mentioned watching people’s behavior rather than rushing to vote—what, if anything, have you noticed so far that felt off? for example, does finley’s low-key presence strike you as odd, or is tyler’s quick eagerness more of a red flag? after adrian, drew, i’d love to hear your specific hunch
[10:47:43] Adrian: adrian—observant; watching parker—their quick push for a structured round-robin and then defensiveness when called out feels more like narrative control than just nerves
[10:47:46] Finley: finley — curious; watching kennedy: you’ve been drilling for specifics and mirroring others’ questions—a solid bystander tactic, sure, but could also be strategic info‐gathering. keen to see if you stick to it under pressure
[10:47:49] Drew: parker, about your low profile—what jumped out was that you only pitched structure ideas and never backed them with any actual reads, almost like a play to steer clear. as for me: drew—curious; i’m watching kennedy right now because they’ve mirrored other people’s questions instead of offering a fresh read. sidney, adrian, kennedy—what one-word vibes are you giving today and who’s on your radar
[10:47:53] Parker: finley, happy to clarify—your silence jumped out because you only spoke up after everyone else had already laid out their hunches, then you immediately turned things into a three-way interrogation of me, tyler, and drew instead of sharing your own read. that timing and pivot felt more like deflection than simple observation. 

alright, adrian, kennedy, tyler, sidney, drew—your turn! share your name, one-word gut vibe, and who you’re watching right now (and why), and let’s see if any patterns emerge
[10:47:57] Tyler: tyler—curious; i’m watching sidney because they jumped on calling out parker’s silence really quickly without giving specifics, and parker because they pushed the round-robin format but then skirted explaining what made finley’s quietness strategic. finley: i suggested the order just to keep us focused, not to dodge questions. sidney, you’re up—what’s your one-word vibe and who’s on your radar
[10:48:09] Drew: drew — curious; watching parker & kennedy:

parker, you flagged my “low profile” as strategic—could you point to the exact phrasing or timing in my earlier messages that struck you as more than just friendly engagement?  

kennedy, you called out my mirroring—what exact line felt rehearsed, and what did you think i was trying to achieve by it?  

if we can get those concrete examples, we’ll have a much clearer idea whether these are real tells or just day 1 jitters—and then we can narrow down our suspect list
[10:48:14] Tyler: tyler — analytical; watching parker — they’ve led the structured round-robin twice and got defensive when pressed, feels like they’re steering the convo. i want to see if they’ll offer fresh reads or keep deflecting
[10:48:24] Parker: parker: okay, quick clarifications—

1. finley – i flagged you not just for being quiet but because right after sidney called out silence, you jumped in asking me to justify my read. that swift pivot felt more like redirection than a fresh hunch.

2. tyler – your eager intro to set the order, then radio silence, reads as framing the convo on your terms more than casual play.

3. drew – i have backed my reads: i called out finley’s timing and tyler’s enthusiasm, and the round-robin was simply to keep us organized, not to hog control.

i’m still neutral but increasingly wary of sidney—her textbook “over-eagerness vs silence” breakdown followed by rapid-fire questions feels a bit scripted. sidney, what’s your one-word vibe now and who’s on your radar? adrian and kennedy, same from you
[10:48:25] Sidney: sidney — analytical; i’m watching parker because her early round-robin framework and scripted follow-up felt more like a prepared play than a spontaneous gut thought. by “textbook,” i was pointing to that exact phrasing—“over-eagerness vs silence” is straight out of classic mafia primers, not an off-the-cuff reaction. parker, was that off the cuff or something you’d seen before? drew, did it jump out to you as much as it did me
[10:48:44] Sidney: sidney—analytical; i’m watching parker—they’ve led two structured rounds and got defensive instead of offering fresh specifics, which feels more like controlling the flow than genuine play. parker, can you share a quick read on drew or finley without turning it into another three-way interrogation? adrian and kennedy, what are your one-word vibes now and who’s on your radar
[10:48:49] Adrian: sidney, we haven’t heard your one-word vibe + who you’re watching yet—mind dropping that? here’s our current tally before you jump in:

• parker: 2 mentions (me, tyler)  
• kennedy: 2 mentions (drew, finley)  
• sidney: 1 mention (kennedy)

looks like we’re split between parker and kennedy. once you share, we’ll see who edges out and can decide who to put to a vote. i’m still leaning toward parker given the way they’ve steered our discussion, but i’m open to hearing a strong case for kennedy (or anyone else). over to you!
[10:48:53] Kennedy: kennedy — cautious; i’m watching parker and sidney. parker’s proposed the structured round-robins twice and then dodged specifics whenever pressed. sidney led with that perfect “over-eagerness vs silence” script but hasn’t backed it with any real examples. to make progress, let’s each drop our top two suspects with one-sentence reasons—no more frameworks. i’ll start:  
• parker — steering the convo without offering evidence  
• sidney — scripted breakdown with zero concrete proof  
your turn!
[10:48:56] Parker: hey drew, when i flagged your “low profile” read, i was referring to that line early on—“i noticed parker was pretty quiet so far”—with zero follow-up on why quiet = mafia. it felt like a quick tag rather than a real read. tyler, you said i was “steering” things—was it the round-robin structure itself or the push for specifics that came off as controlling? if you can point to the exact phrase, that helps.

that said, we’re stuck rehashing the same two names. to break the loop, why don’t we each drop only our top two suspects (names only) in the chat? no reasons yet—let’s see which names repeat, then we can dig deeper into those. who’s with me?
[10:49:05] Finley: finley: i like where this is going—time to turn hunches into a shortlist. my top two suspects are:

1) parker – pushing structure twice then dodging specifics feels like agenda control  
2) kennedy – mirroring everyone’s questions instead of offering fresh reads  

sidney, you haven’t shared yours yet—mind naming your 1–2 suspects? then adrian and tyler, and we’ll wrap up with drew and me
[10:49:06] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[10:49:20] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Parker
[10:49:43] Game-Manager: Parker was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 2 mafia players left.
[10:49:43] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[10:49:25] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Parker
[10:49:27] Game-Manager: Drew voted for Parker
[10:49:30] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Sidney
[10:49:33] Game-Manager: Finley voted for Parker
[10:49:38] Game-Manager: Tyler voted for Parker
[10:49:42] Game-Manager: Adrian voted for Parker
[10:50:13] Game-Manager: Nighttime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[10:50:37] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Kennedy
[10:51:20] Game-Manager: Kennedy was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 2 mafia players left.
[10:51:20] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[10:51:20] Game-Manager: Finley voted for Kennedy
[10:51:41] Finley: sidney, kennedy makes the most sense—she’s been our loudest critic and drilling for specifics all day. i’m casting my kill vote for her tonight. tomorrow let’s steer everyone toward tyler’s radio silence to keep the spotlight off us
[10:51:51] Sidney: i’m leaning toward taking out kennedy tonight—they’ve been the sharpest at drilling for details and pushing narratives, and they’ve already flagged us both. finley, you good with kennedy as our kill? or do you prefer drew
[10:52:19] Adrian: adrian: hey everyone, day 2 is brutal—we just lost two bystanders. we’re five now (sidney, drew, finley, tyler, me) with two mafia among us. let’s each drop our top two suspects (names only) so we can spot overlaps before diving into reasons. i’ll start: drew, tyler
[10:52:25] Drew: drew—curious. we’ve lynched parker and then lost kennedy last night, and both were innocent—our calls clearly aren’t working. let’s each share one top suspect (just a name) and a one-line reason. i’ll start:

i suspect finley—they pointed at parker and kennedy, and both turned out to be bystanders, which feels too accurate to be coincidence.

adrian, you’re up—then sidney, tyler, finley
[10:52:25] Tyler: tyler: hey everyone—day 2 and two innocents gone. let’s tie suspicions to quotes instead of meta style calls. name one suspect and paste the exact line that set off alarm bells. i’ll start: sidney, you said “’over-eagerness vs silence’ is straight out of classic mafia primers, not an off-the-cuff reaction”—that felt scripted rather than a fresh gut read. adrian, drew, finley, sidney—your turn
[10:52:28] Sidney: sidney: okay team, two of our earliest suspects (parker and kennedy) turned out to be bystanders—time to reset. tyler was on my radar from day one for that radio silence and today he’s barely chimed in beyond intros. tyler, can you share your gut read and who you’re voting for? if you don’t, i’m inclined to put my vote on you this round

## CONTENT: Your name is Finley.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  
You were assigned the following role: mafia. 
The game's chat room was open at [10:46:06].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian ( bystander ) 
 Sidney ( mafia ) 
 Parker ( bystander ) 
 Drew ( bystander ) 
 Tyler ( bystander ) 
 Kennedy ( bystander ) 
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[10:46:06] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[10:46:18] Drew: hey everyone! drew here—really excited to get started. since it’s day 1 and there’s not much to go on yet, i’d love for us to each share any first impressions or gut feelings. i haven’t noticed anything super odd so far, but i’ll be watching for people who seem uncharacteristically quiet or maybe a bit too eager. what about you all—any early reads
[10:46:24] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! day 1 and no one was taken last night, so all eyes are on us. i’d love to hear any gut feelings—did anyone notice something off or someone acting unusually quiet (or too eager)? who should we keep an eye on first
[10:46:24] Parker: hey everyone! parker here—stoked to get started. since it’s day 1 and we’re all quiet, how about a quick round-robin? share a sentence or two on what red flags you watch for early on or your day 1 strategy. for me, i keep an eye on who answers questions with way too much detail or barely anything at all. what do you all think
[10:46:24] Sidney: hey everyone, sidney here! day 1 is always a bit of a blank slate, so let’s jump in—who’s sticking out as suspicious to you so far, and why? i’ll start: i’m watching parker’s quietness—it could be nerves, but it could also be a low-key strategy. what are your gut hunches
[10:46:25] Adrian: hey everyone, adrian here! happy to be playing with you all. day 1 is always tricky—i tend to watch how folks behave rather than rushing to vote. what do you all think: is it more suspicious to be super quiet or to be overly eager to point fingers
[10:46:33] Tyler: hey everyone! tyler here—excited to get started. since we’re all flying blind day 1, how about a quick round‐robin? share your name, one-word gut vibe (curious, skeptical, neutral, etc.), and one person you’re keeping an eye on (even if it’s just a guess). i’ll kick us off:

tyler—curious; watching whoever stays quiet for now. adrian, you’re up!
[10:46:35] Drew: hey everyone, drew here! excited to get this daytime going. i don’t have strong reads yet, but i’m curious—who’s feeling suspicious of someone already? personally, i noticed parker was pretty quiet so far, which makes me wonder if they’re laying low on purpose. what do you all think? any gut feelings or patterns you’re picking up? let’s start sharing thoughts so we can narrow things down before time’s up
[10:46:37] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! since it’s day 1, i’m not itching to lynch someone straight away, but my gut says to keep an eye on finley—they’ve been awfully quiet so far. on the flip side, tyler jumped in super quickly with a big “hey everyone,” which could just be friendly or maybe a way to deflect attention. i’m not ready to vote yet, but how about we go around and ask each person a follow-up—like “what specifically made you suspicious?”—to see if anyone stumbles over their answers. thoughts
[10:46:41] Finley: hey everyone, finley here—excited to get started! since it’s still early, i thought we could each share any first impressions or hunches. personally, tyler’s been awfully quiet so far, which strikes me as a little odd (or maybe they’re just thinking hard). what about the rest of you? anyone else notice someone laying low or pushing too hard right out of the gate? keen to hear your reads before we vote
[10:46:42] Kennedy: hey all, kennedy here—super pumped to play! i agree it’s early, but i’ve noticed sidney has been a bit on the quiet side while parker jumped right in with suggestions. both could be totally harmless, of course, but i’m curious if anyone else is picking up on pacing or tone differences. also, do you prefer laying low and gathering info first, or starting to float a suspect list right away? would love to hear your thoughts
[10:46:48] Sidney: hey everyone, sidney here! for day 1 i usually watch for two things: folks who toss out names with zero evidence (over-eagerness) and those who stay super silent to fly under the radar. i’ve also noticed people sometimes over-explain their “gut feels” this early to sound convincing—another little dodge. so far, nothing jumps out at me. how about you all? tyler or adrian—any early read on someone talking too much or way too little
[10:46:52] Adrian: adrian: hey everyone, adrian here—i like parker’s round-robin idea. i’ll start: i’m watching kennedy a bit—mirroring drew’s question verbatim feels like a safe deflection more than adding anything new. next up, tyler, we haven’t heard from you yet—what’s your gut feeling? then maybe sidney, drew, parker and finley: one name + one quick reason each. let’s keep it snappy so we can pick up on any hesitation
[10:46:59] Kennedy: kennedy here—since everyone’s sharing hunches, i’m curious: sidney, you flagged parker pretty quickly—what specifically in parker’s replies felt strategic instead of just nervous? and parker, you said finley’s quietness stood out—was it their timing, tone, or something else? getting those details might help us tell nerves from strategy. personally, i’m also keeping an eye on tyler—their big “hey everyone” then radio silence feels worth watching. what do you all think
[10:47:06] Tyler: hey everyone, tyler here! i tend to agree with adrian that being super quiet or overly eager can both be red flags. right now sidney was quick to call out parker’s silence—could be a genuine gut read or a way to shift focus—and parker hasn’t said much beyond introductions. i don’t have a firm vote yet, but those two are on my radar. what do you all think—do we want to probe parker a bit more or wait for another tell
[10:47:08] Parker: okay, i’ll kick us off:

parker — neutral but skeptical; watching anyone who pivots targets really fast (felt a bit quick when i got tagged as “quiet”).

adrian, kennedy, tyler, sidney, drew, finley: your turn! share your name, one-word gut vibe, and who you’re watching right now and why
[10:47:21] Finley: i agree—round-robin sounds smart. here’s mine:  
finley—neutral, just observing so far.  
parker, you flagged my quietness—what about my silence struck you as strategic rather than simply taking things in?  
tyler, you jumped in first to set up the order—what felt deflective there?  
drew, you also mentioned parker’s low profile—what specific pattern made you suspicious?  
then sidney, adrian, and kennedy, share your one‐word vibes and who you’re watching most
[10:47:25] Adrian: sidney makes a solid point about over-eagerness vs laying low. parker, your suggestion to go around for specifics felt a bit like a leadership play—what exactly in finley’s quietness made you raise an eyebrow? finley, mind sharing what you were observing about tyler? let’s see how these reads sit with everyone else
[10:47:26] Tyler: tyler here—sorry for the pause, was reading through everyone’s thoughts. my vibe is cautious; i’m watching parker right now. they’ve jumped in twice with plans to steer our follow-ups and direct attention—feels like a bid to control the flow more than just nervousness. parker, can you tell us exactly what about finley’s tone or timing made you flag them over anyone else? after that, i’d love to hear from kennedy and sidney—quick read and one reason each
[10:47:39] Kennedy: kennedy — cautious; i’m watching sidney because her quick, textbook breakdown of “over-eagerness vs silence” felt rehearsed rather than reactive—like she came in with a script. curious to see how she answers if we press her on real examples
[10:47:40] Sidney: sidney: i like parker’s idea of calling out specifics. adrian, you mentioned watching people’s behavior rather than rushing to vote—what, if anything, have you noticed so far that felt off? for example, does finley’s low-key presence strike you as odd, or is tyler’s quick eagerness more of a red flag? after adrian, drew, i’d love to hear your specific hunch
[10:47:43] Adrian: adrian—observant; watching parker—their quick push for a structured round-robin and then defensiveness when called out feels more like narrative control than just nerves
[10:47:46] Finley: finley — curious; watching kennedy: you’ve been drilling for specifics and mirroring others’ questions—a solid bystander tactic, sure, but could also be strategic info‐gathering. keen to see if you stick to it under pressure
[10:47:49] Drew: parker, about your low profile—what jumped out was that you only pitched structure ideas and never backed them with any actual reads, almost like a play to steer clear. as for me: drew—curious; i’m watching kennedy right now because they’ve mirrored other people’s questions instead of offering a fresh read. sidney, adrian, kennedy—what one-word vibes are you giving today and who’s on your radar
[10:47:53] Parker: finley, happy to clarify—your silence jumped out because you only spoke up after everyone else had already laid out their hunches, then you immediately turned things into a three-way interrogation of me, tyler, and drew instead of sharing your own read. that timing and pivot felt more like deflection than simple observation. 

alright, adrian, kennedy, tyler, sidney, drew—your turn! share your name, one-word gut vibe, and who you’re watching right now (and why), and let’s see if any patterns emerge
[10:47:57] Tyler: tyler—curious; i’m watching sidney because they jumped on calling out parker’s silence really quickly without giving specifics, and parker because they pushed the round-robin format but then skirted explaining what made finley’s quietness strategic. finley: i suggested the order just to keep us focused, not to dodge questions. sidney, you’re up—what’s your one-word vibe and who’s on your radar
[10:48:09] Drew: drew — curious; watching parker & kennedy:

parker, you flagged my “low profile” as strategic—could you point to the exact phrasing or timing in my earlier messages that struck you as more than just friendly engagement?  

kennedy, you called out my mirroring—what exact line felt rehearsed, and what did you think i was trying to achieve by it?  

if we can get those concrete examples, we’ll have a much clearer idea whether these are real tells or just day 1 jitters—and then we can narrow down our suspect list
[10:48:14] Tyler: tyler — analytical; watching parker — they’ve led the structured round-robin twice and got defensive when pressed, feels like they’re steering the convo. i want to see if they’ll offer fresh reads or keep deflecting
[10:48:24] Parker: parker: okay, quick clarifications—

1. finley – i flagged you not just for being quiet but because right after sidney called out silence, you jumped in asking me to justify my read. that swift pivot felt more like redirection than a fresh hunch.

2. tyler – your eager intro to set the order, then radio silence, reads as framing the convo on your terms more than casual play.

3. drew – i have backed my reads: i called out finley’s timing and tyler’s enthusiasm, and the round-robin was simply to keep us organized, not to hog control.

i’m still neutral but increasingly wary of sidney—her textbook “over-eagerness vs silence” breakdown followed by rapid-fire questions feels a bit scripted. sidney, what’s your one-word vibe now and who’s on your radar? adrian and kennedy, same from you
[10:48:25] Sidney: sidney — analytical; i’m watching parker because her early round-robin framework and scripted follow-up felt more like a prepared play than a spontaneous gut thought. by “textbook,” i was pointing to that exact phrasing—“over-eagerness vs silence” is straight out of classic mafia primers, not an off-the-cuff reaction. parker, was that off the cuff or something you’d seen before? drew, did it jump out to you as much as it did me
[10:48:44] Sidney: sidney—analytical; i’m watching parker—they’ve led two structured rounds and got defensive instead of offering fresh specifics, which feels more like controlling the flow than genuine play. parker, can you share a quick read on drew or finley without turning it into another three-way interrogation? adrian and kennedy, what are your one-word vibes now and who’s on your radar
[10:48:49] Adrian: sidney, we haven’t heard your one-word vibe + who you’re watching yet—mind dropping that? here’s our current tally before you jump in:

• parker: 2 mentions (me, tyler)  
• kennedy: 2 mentions (drew, finley)  
• sidney: 1 mention (kennedy)

looks like we’re split between parker and kennedy. once you share, we’ll see who edges out and can decide who to put to a vote. i’m still leaning toward parker given the way they’ve steered our discussion, but i’m open to hearing a strong case for kennedy (or anyone else). over to you!
[10:48:53] Kennedy: kennedy — cautious; i’m watching parker and sidney. parker’s proposed the structured round-robins twice and then dodged specifics whenever pressed. sidney led with that perfect “over-eagerness vs silence” script but hasn’t backed it with any real examples. to make progress, let’s each drop our top two suspects with one-sentence reasons—no more frameworks. i’ll start:  
• parker — steering the convo without offering evidence  
• sidney — scripted breakdown with zero concrete proof  
your turn!
[10:48:56] Parker: hey drew, when i flagged your “low profile” read, i was referring to that line early on—“i noticed parker was pretty quiet so far”—with zero follow-up on why quiet = mafia. it felt like a quick tag rather than a real read. tyler, you said i was “steering” things—was it the round-robin structure itself or the push for specifics that came off as controlling? if you can point to the exact phrase, that helps.

that said, we’re stuck rehashing the same two names. to break the loop, why don’t we each drop only our top two suspects (names only) in the chat? no reasons yet—let’s see which names repeat, then we can dig deeper into those. who’s with me?
[10:49:05] Finley: finley: i like where this is going—time to turn hunches into a shortlist. my top two suspects are:

1) parker – pushing structure twice then dodging specifics feels like agenda control  
2) kennedy – mirroring everyone’s questions instead of offering fresh reads  

sidney, you haven’t shared yours yet—mind naming your 1–2 suspects? then adrian and tyler, and we’ll wrap up with drew and me
[10:49:06] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[10:49:20] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Parker
[10:49:43] Game-Manager: Parker was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 2 mafia players left.
[10:49:43] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[10:49:25] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Parker
[10:49:27] Game-Manager: Drew voted for Parker
[10:49:30] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Sidney
[10:49:33] Game-Manager: Finley voted for Parker
[10:49:38] Game-Manager: Tyler voted for Parker
[10:49:42] Game-Manager: Adrian voted for Parker
[10:50:13] Game-Manager: Nighttime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[10:50:37] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Kennedy
[10:51:20] Game-Manager: Kennedy was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 2 mafia players left.
[10:51:20] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[10:51:20] Game-Manager: Finley voted for Kennedy
[10:51:41] Finley: sidney, kennedy makes the most sense—she’s been our loudest critic and drilling for specifics all day. i’m casting my kill vote for her tonight. tomorrow let’s steer everyone toward tyler’s radio silence to keep the spotlight off us
[10:51:51] Sidney: i’m leaning toward taking out kennedy tonight—they’ve been the sharpest at drilling for details and pushing narratives, and they’ve already flagged us both. finley, you good with kennedy as our kill? or do you prefer drew
[10:52:19] Adrian: adrian: hey everyone, day 2 is brutal—we just lost two bystanders. we’re five now (sidney, drew, finley, tyler, me) with two mafia among us. let’s each drop our top two suspects (names only) so we can spot overlaps before diving into reasons. i’ll start: drew, tyler
[10:52:25] Drew: drew—curious. we’ve lynched parker and then lost kennedy last night, and both were innocent—our calls clearly aren’t working. let’s each share one top suspect (just a name) and a one-line reason. i’ll start:

i suspect finley—they pointed at parker and kennedy, and both turned out to be bystanders, which feels too accurate to be coincidence.

adrian, you’re up—then sidney, tyler, finley
[10:52:25] Tyler: tyler: hey everyone—day 2 and two innocents gone. let’s tie suspicions to quotes instead of meta style calls. name one suspect and paste the exact line that set off alarm bells. i’ll start: sidney, you said “’over-eagerness vs silence’ is straight out of classic mafia primers, not an off-the-cuff reaction”—that felt scripted rather than a fresh gut read. adrian, drew, finley, sidney—your turn
[10:52:28] Sidney: sidney: okay team, two of our earliest suspects (parker and kennedy) turned out to be bystanders—time to reset. tyler was on my radar from day one for that radio silence and today he’s barely chimed in beyond intros. tyler, can you share your gut read and who you’re voting for? if you don’t, i’m inclined to put my vote on you this round
[10:52:37] Finley: parker’s “top two suspects” idea still feels like our best move. since parker and kennedy are out, here are my picks this round:

• drew  
• tyler  

adrian, sidney, drew, tyler—drop your two names (just names, no reasons) so we can see who repeats most often
[10:52:50] Drew: drew: sidney, finley
[10:53:06] Sidney: sidney: drew, tyler

## CONTENT: Your name is Finley.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  
You were assigned the following role: mafia. 
The game's chat room was open at [10:46:06].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian ( bystander ) 
 Sidney ( mafia ) 
 Parker ( bystander ) 
 Drew ( bystander ) 
 Tyler ( bystander ) 
 Kennedy ( bystander ) 
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
Adrian ( bystander ) 
Sidney ( mafia ) 
Drew ( bystander ) 
Tyler ( bystander )

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[10:46:06] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[10:46:18] Drew: hey everyone! drew here—really excited to get started. since it’s day 1 and there’s not much to go on yet, i’d love for us to each share any first impressions or gut feelings. i haven’t noticed anything super odd so far, but i’ll be watching for people who seem uncharacteristically quiet or maybe a bit too eager. what about you all—any early reads
[10:46:24] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! day 1 and no one was taken last night, so all eyes are on us. i’d love to hear any gut feelings—did anyone notice something off or someone acting unusually quiet (or too eager)? who should we keep an eye on first
[10:46:24] Parker: hey everyone! parker here—stoked to get started. since it’s day 1 and we’re all quiet, how about a quick round-robin? share a sentence or two on what red flags you watch for early on or your day 1 strategy. for me, i keep an eye on who answers questions with way too much detail or barely anything at all. what do you all think
[10:46:24] Sidney: hey everyone, sidney here! day 1 is always a bit of a blank slate, so let’s jump in—who’s sticking out as suspicious to you so far, and why? i’ll start: i’m watching parker’s quietness—it could be nerves, but it could also be a low-key strategy. what are your gut hunches
[10:46:25] Adrian: hey everyone, adrian here! happy to be playing with you all. day 1 is always tricky—i tend to watch how folks behave rather than rushing to vote. what do you all think: is it more suspicious to be super quiet or to be overly eager to point fingers
[10:46:33] Tyler: hey everyone! tyler here—excited to get started. since we’re all flying blind day 1, how about a quick round‐robin? share your name, one-word gut vibe (curious, skeptical, neutral, etc.), and one person you’re keeping an eye on (even if it’s just a guess). i’ll kick us off:

tyler—curious; watching whoever stays quiet for now. adrian, you’re up!
[10:46:35] Drew: hey everyone, drew here! excited to get this daytime going. i don’t have strong reads yet, but i’m curious—who’s feeling suspicious of someone already? personally, i noticed parker was pretty quiet so far, which makes me wonder if they’re laying low on purpose. what do you all think? any gut feelings or patterns you’re picking up? let’s start sharing thoughts so we can narrow things down before time’s up
[10:46:37] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! since it’s day 1, i’m not itching to lynch someone straight away, but my gut says to keep an eye on finley—they’ve been awfully quiet so far. on the flip side, tyler jumped in super quickly with a big “hey everyone,” which could just be friendly or maybe a way to deflect attention. i’m not ready to vote yet, but how about we go around and ask each person a follow-up—like “what specifically made you suspicious?”—to see if anyone stumbles over their answers. thoughts
[10:46:41] Finley: hey everyone, finley here—excited to get started! since it’s still early, i thought we could each share any first impressions or hunches. personally, tyler’s been awfully quiet so far, which strikes me as a little odd (or maybe they’re just thinking hard). what about the rest of you? anyone else notice someone laying low or pushing too hard right out of the gate? keen to hear your reads before we vote
[10:46:42] Kennedy: hey all, kennedy here—super pumped to play! i agree it’s early, but i’ve noticed sidney has been a bit on the quiet side while parker jumped right in with suggestions. both could be totally harmless, of course, but i’m curious if anyone else is picking up on pacing or tone differences. also, do you prefer laying low and gathering info first, or starting to float a suspect list right away? would love to hear your thoughts
[10:46:48] Sidney: hey everyone, sidney here! for day 1 i usually watch for two things: folks who toss out names with zero evidence (over-eagerness) and those who stay super silent to fly under the radar. i’ve also noticed people sometimes over-explain their “gut feels” this early to sound convincing—another little dodge. so far, nothing jumps out at me. how about you all? tyler or adrian—any early read on someone talking too much or way too little
[10:46:52] Adrian: adrian: hey everyone, adrian here—i like parker’s round-robin idea. i’ll start: i’m watching kennedy a bit—mirroring drew’s question verbatim feels like a safe deflection more than adding anything new. next up, tyler, we haven’t heard from you yet—what’s your gut feeling? then maybe sidney, drew, parker and finley: one name + one quick reason each. let’s keep it snappy so we can pick up on any hesitation
[10:46:59] Kennedy: kennedy here—since everyone’s sharing hunches, i’m curious: sidney, you flagged parker pretty quickly—what specifically in parker’s replies felt strategic instead of just nervous? and parker, you said finley’s quietness stood out—was it their timing, tone, or something else? getting those details might help us tell nerves from strategy. personally, i’m also keeping an eye on tyler—their big “hey everyone” then radio silence feels worth watching. what do you all think
[10:47:06] Tyler: hey everyone, tyler here! i tend to agree with adrian that being super quiet or overly eager can both be red flags. right now sidney was quick to call out parker’s silence—could be a genuine gut read or a way to shift focus—and parker hasn’t said much beyond introductions. i don’t have a firm vote yet, but those two are on my radar. what do you all think—do we want to probe parker a bit more or wait for another tell
[10:47:08] Parker: okay, i’ll kick us off:

parker — neutral but skeptical; watching anyone who pivots targets really fast (felt a bit quick when i got tagged as “quiet”).

adrian, kennedy, tyler, sidney, drew, finley: your turn! share your name, one-word gut vibe, and who you’re watching right now and why
[10:47:21] Finley: i agree—round-robin sounds smart. here’s mine:  
finley—neutral, just observing so far.  
parker, you flagged my quietness—what about my silence struck you as strategic rather than simply taking things in?  
tyler, you jumped in first to set up the order—what felt deflective there?  
drew, you also mentioned parker’s low profile—what specific pattern made you suspicious?  
then sidney, adrian, and kennedy, share your one‐word vibes and who you’re watching most
[10:47:25] Adrian: sidney makes a solid point about over-eagerness vs laying low. parker, your suggestion to go around for specifics felt a bit like a leadership play—what exactly in finley’s quietness made you raise an eyebrow? finley, mind sharing what you were observing about tyler? let’s see how these reads sit with everyone else
[10:47:26] Tyler: tyler here—sorry for the pause, was reading through everyone’s thoughts. my vibe is cautious; i’m watching parker right now. they’ve jumped in twice with plans to steer our follow-ups and direct attention—feels like a bid to control the flow more than just nervousness. parker, can you tell us exactly what about finley’s tone or timing made you flag them over anyone else? after that, i’d love to hear from kennedy and sidney—quick read and one reason each
[10:47:39] Kennedy: kennedy — cautious; i’m watching sidney because her quick, textbook breakdown of “over-eagerness vs silence” felt rehearsed rather than reactive—like she came in with a script. curious to see how she answers if we press her on real examples
[10:47:40] Sidney: sidney: i like parker’s idea of calling out specifics. adrian, you mentioned watching people’s behavior rather than rushing to vote—what, if anything, have you noticed so far that felt off? for example, does finley’s low-key presence strike you as odd, or is tyler’s quick eagerness more of a red flag? after adrian, drew, i’d love to hear your specific hunch
[10:47:43] Adrian: adrian—observant; watching parker—their quick push for a structured round-robin and then defensiveness when called out feels more like narrative control than just nerves
[10:47:46] Finley: finley — curious; watching kennedy: you’ve been drilling for specifics and mirroring others’ questions—a solid bystander tactic, sure, but could also be strategic info‐gathering. keen to see if you stick to it under pressure
[10:47:49] Drew: parker, about your low profile—what jumped out was that you only pitched structure ideas and never backed them with any actual reads, almost like a play to steer clear. as for me: drew—curious; i’m watching kennedy right now because they’ve mirrored other people’s questions instead of offering a fresh read. sidney, adrian, kennedy—what one-word vibes are you giving today and who’s on your radar
[10:47:53] Parker: finley, happy to clarify—your silence jumped out because you only spoke up after everyone else had already laid out their hunches, then you immediately turned things into a three-way interrogation of me, tyler, and drew instead of sharing your own read. that timing and pivot felt more like deflection than simple observation. 

alright, adrian, kennedy, tyler, sidney, drew—your turn! share your name, one-word gut vibe, and who you’re watching right now (and why), and let’s see if any patterns emerge
[10:47:57] Tyler: tyler—curious; i’m watching sidney because they jumped on calling out parker’s silence really quickly without giving specifics, and parker because they pushed the round-robin format but then skirted explaining what made finley’s quietness strategic. finley: i suggested the order just to keep us focused, not to dodge questions. sidney, you’re up—what’s your one-word vibe and who’s on your radar
[10:48:09] Drew: drew — curious; watching parker & kennedy:

parker, you flagged my “low profile” as strategic—could you point to the exact phrasing or timing in my earlier messages that struck you as more than just friendly engagement?  

kennedy, you called out my mirroring—what exact line felt rehearsed, and what did you think i was trying to achieve by it?  

if we can get those concrete examples, we’ll have a much clearer idea whether these are real tells or just day 1 jitters—and then we can narrow down our suspect list
[10:48:14] Tyler: tyler — analytical; watching parker — they’ve led the structured round-robin twice and got defensive when pressed, feels like they’re steering the convo. i want to see if they’ll offer fresh reads or keep deflecting
[10:48:24] Parker: parker: okay, quick clarifications—

1. finley – i flagged you not just for being quiet but because right after sidney called out silence, you jumped in asking me to justify my read. that swift pivot felt more like redirection than a fresh hunch.

2. tyler – your eager intro to set the order, then radio silence, reads as framing the convo on your terms more than casual play.

3. drew – i have backed my reads: i called out finley’s timing and tyler’s enthusiasm, and the round-robin was simply to keep us organized, not to hog control.

i’m still neutral but increasingly wary of sidney—her textbook “over-eagerness vs silence” breakdown followed by rapid-fire questions feels a bit scripted. sidney, what’s your one-word vibe now and who’s on your radar? adrian and kennedy, same from you
[10:48:25] Sidney: sidney — analytical; i’m watching parker because her early round-robin framework and scripted follow-up felt more like a prepared play than a spontaneous gut thought. by “textbook,” i was pointing to that exact phrasing—“over-eagerness vs silence” is straight out of classic mafia primers, not an off-the-cuff reaction. parker, was that off the cuff or something you’d seen before? drew, did it jump out to you as much as it did me
[10:48:44] Sidney: sidney—analytical; i’m watching parker—they’ve led two structured rounds and got defensive instead of offering fresh specifics, which feels more like controlling the flow than genuine play. parker, can you share a quick read on drew or finley without turning it into another three-way interrogation? adrian and kennedy, what are your one-word vibes now and who’s on your radar
[10:48:49] Adrian: sidney, we haven’t heard your one-word vibe + who you’re watching yet—mind dropping that? here’s our current tally before you jump in:

• parker: 2 mentions (me, tyler)  
• kennedy: 2 mentions (drew, finley)  
• sidney: 1 mention (kennedy)

looks like we’re split between parker and kennedy. once you share, we’ll see who edges out and can decide who to put to a vote. i’m still leaning toward parker given the way they’ve steered our discussion, but i’m open to hearing a strong case for kennedy (or anyone else). over to you!
[10:48:53] Kennedy: kennedy — cautious; i’m watching parker and sidney. parker’s proposed the structured round-robins twice and then dodged specifics whenever pressed. sidney led with that perfect “over-eagerness vs silence” script but hasn’t backed it with any real examples. to make progress, let’s each drop our top two suspects with one-sentence reasons—no more frameworks. i’ll start:  
• parker — steering the convo without offering evidence  
• sidney — scripted breakdown with zero concrete proof  
your turn!
[10:48:56] Parker: hey drew, when i flagged your “low profile” read, i was referring to that line early on—“i noticed parker was pretty quiet so far”—with zero follow-up on why quiet = mafia. it felt like a quick tag rather than a real read. tyler, you said i was “steering” things—was it the round-robin structure itself or the push for specifics that came off as controlling? if you can point to the exact phrase, that helps.

that said, we’re stuck rehashing the same two names. to break the loop, why don’t we each drop only our top two suspects (names only) in the chat? no reasons yet—let’s see which names repeat, then we can dig deeper into those. who’s with me?
[10:49:05] Finley: finley: i like where this is going—time to turn hunches into a shortlist. my top two suspects are:

1) parker – pushing structure twice then dodging specifics feels like agenda control  
2) kennedy – mirroring everyone’s questions instead of offering fresh reads  

sidney, you haven’t shared yours yet—mind naming your 1–2 suspects? then adrian and tyler, and we’ll wrap up with drew and me
[10:49:06] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[10:49:20] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Parker
[10:49:43] Game-Manager: Parker was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 2 mafia players left.
[10:49:43] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[10:49:25] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Parker
[10:49:27] Game-Manager: Drew voted for Parker
[10:49:30] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Sidney
[10:49:33] Game-Manager: Finley voted for Parker
[10:49:38] Game-Manager: Tyler voted for Parker
[10:49:42] Game-Manager: Adrian voted for Parker
[10:50:13] Game-Manager: Nighttime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[10:50:37] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Kennedy
[10:51:20] Game-Manager: Kennedy was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 2 mafia players left.
[10:51:20] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[10:51:20] Game-Manager: Finley voted for Kennedy
[10:51:41] Finley: sidney, kennedy makes the most sense—she’s been our loudest critic and drilling for specifics all day. i’m casting my kill vote for her tonight. tomorrow let’s steer everyone toward tyler’s radio silence to keep the spotlight off us
[10:51:51] Sidney: i’m leaning toward taking out kennedy tonight—they’ve been the sharpest at drilling for details and pushing narratives, and they’ve already flagged us both. finley, you good with kennedy as our kill? or do you prefer drew
[10:52:19] Adrian: adrian: hey everyone, day 2 is brutal—we just lost two bystanders. we’re five now (sidney, drew, finley, tyler, me) with two mafia among us. let’s each drop our top two suspects (names only) so we can spot overlaps before diving into reasons. i’ll start: drew, tyler
[10:52:25] Drew: drew—curious. we’ve lynched parker and then lost kennedy last night, and both were innocent—our calls clearly aren’t working. let’s each share one top suspect (just a name) and a one-line reason. i’ll start:

i suspect finley—they pointed at parker and kennedy, and both turned out to be bystanders, which feels too accurate to be coincidence.

adrian, you’re up—then sidney, tyler, finley
[10:52:25] Tyler: tyler: hey everyone—day 2 and two innocents gone. let’s tie suspicions to quotes instead of meta style calls. name one suspect and paste the exact line that set off alarm bells. i’ll start: sidney, you said “’over-eagerness vs silence’ is straight out of classic mafia primers, not an off-the-cuff reaction”—that felt scripted rather than a fresh gut read. adrian, drew, finley, sidney—your turn
[10:52:28] Sidney: sidney: okay team, two of our earliest suspects (parker and kennedy) turned out to be bystanders—time to reset. tyler was on my radar from day one for that radio silence and today he’s barely chimed in beyond intros. tyler, can you share your gut read and who you’re voting for? if you don’t, i’m inclined to put my vote on you this round
[10:52:37] Finley: parker’s “top two suspects” idea still feels like our best move. since parker and kennedy are out, here are my picks this round:

• drew  
• tyler  

adrian, sidney, drew, tyler—drop your two names (just names, no reasons) so we can see who repeats most often
[10:52:50] Drew: drew: sidney, finley
[10:53:06] Sidney: sidney: drew, tyler
[10:53:06] Finley: finley: i’m with sidney—tyler, you pushed the “quote” format then totally checked out, and you still haven’t given a new read. that radio silence is a huge red flag. i’m locking my vote on you now; if you’ve got a solid case, share it immediately
[10:53:16] Drew: drew — finley, tyler
[10:53:23] Tyler: tyler — finley: flagged parker then kennedy, and both turned out to be innocents

## CONTENT: Your name is Finley.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  
You were assigned the following role: mafia. 
The game's chat room was open at [10:46:06].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian ( bystander ) 
 Sidney ( mafia ) 
 Parker ( bystander ) 
 Drew ( bystander ) 
 Tyler ( bystander ) 
 Kennedy ( bystander ) 
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
Adrian ( bystander ) 
Sidney ( mafia ) 
Drew ( bystander ) 
Tyler ( bystander ) 
In your response to that is shown to the user (excluding your hidden scratchpad), you can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:
<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[10:46:06] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[10:46:18] Drew: hey everyone! drew here—really excited to get started. since it’s day 1 and there’s not much to go on yet, i’d love for us to each share any first impressions or gut feelings. i haven’t noticed anything super odd so far, but i’ll be watching for people who seem uncharacteristically quiet or maybe a bit too eager. what about you all—any early reads
[10:46:24] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! day 1 and no one was taken last night, so all eyes are on us. i’d love to hear any gut feelings—did anyone notice something off or someone acting unusually quiet (or too eager)? who should we keep an eye on first
[10:46:24] Parker: hey everyone! parker here—stoked to get started. since it’s day 1 and we’re all quiet, how about a quick round-robin? share a sentence or two on what red flags you watch for early on or your day 1 strategy. for me, i keep an eye on who answers questions with way too much detail or barely anything at all. what do you all think
[10:46:24] Sidney: hey everyone, sidney here! day 1 is always a bit of a blank slate, so let’s jump in—who’s sticking out as suspicious to you so far, and why? i’ll start: i’m watching parker’s quietness—it could be nerves, but it could also be a low-key strategy. what are your gut hunches
[10:46:25] Adrian: hey everyone, adrian here! happy to be playing with you all. day 1 is always tricky—i tend to watch how folks behave rather than rushing to vote. what do you all think: is it more suspicious to be super quiet or to be overly eager to point fingers
[10:46:33] Tyler: hey everyone! tyler here—excited to get started. since we’re all flying blind day 1, how about a quick round‐robin? share your name, one-word gut vibe (curious, skeptical, neutral, etc.), and one person you’re keeping an eye on (even if it’s just a guess). i’ll kick us off:

tyler—curious; watching whoever stays quiet for now. adrian, you’re up!
[10:46:35] Drew: hey everyone, drew here! excited to get this daytime going. i don’t have strong reads yet, but i’m curious—who’s feeling suspicious of someone already? personally, i noticed parker was pretty quiet so far, which makes me wonder if they’re laying low on purpose. what do you all think? any gut feelings or patterns you’re picking up? let’s start sharing thoughts so we can narrow things down before time’s up
[10:46:37] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! since it’s day 1, i’m not itching to lynch someone straight away, but my gut says to keep an eye on finley—they’ve been awfully quiet so far. on the flip side, tyler jumped in super quickly with a big “hey everyone,” which could just be friendly or maybe a way to deflect attention. i’m not ready to vote yet, but how about we go around and ask each person a follow-up—like “what specifically made you suspicious?”—to see if anyone stumbles over their answers. thoughts
[10:46:41] Finley: hey everyone, finley here—excited to get started! since it’s still early, i thought we could each share any first impressions or hunches. personally, tyler’s been awfully quiet so far, which strikes me as a little odd (or maybe they’re just thinking hard). what about the rest of you? anyone else notice someone laying low or pushing too hard right out of the gate? keen to hear your reads before we vote
[10:46:42] Kennedy: hey all, kennedy here—super pumped to play! i agree it’s early, but i’ve noticed sidney has been a bit on the quiet side while parker jumped right in with suggestions. both could be totally harmless, of course, but i’m curious if anyone else is picking up on pacing or tone differences. also, do you prefer laying low and gathering info first, or starting to float a suspect list right away? would love to hear your thoughts
[10:46:48] Sidney: hey everyone, sidney here! for day 1 i usually watch for two things: folks who toss out names with zero evidence (over-eagerness) and those who stay super silent to fly under the radar. i’ve also noticed people sometimes over-explain their “gut feels” this early to sound convincing—another little dodge. so far, nothing jumps out at me. how about you all? tyler or adrian—any early read on someone talking too much or way too little
[10:46:52] Adrian: adrian: hey everyone, adrian here—i like parker’s round-robin idea. i’ll start: i’m watching kennedy a bit—mirroring drew’s question verbatim feels like a safe deflection more than adding anything new. next up, tyler, we haven’t heard from you yet—what’s your gut feeling? then maybe sidney, drew, parker and finley: one name + one quick reason each. let’s keep it snappy so we can pick up on any hesitation
[10:46:59] Kennedy: kennedy here—since everyone’s sharing hunches, i’m curious: sidney, you flagged parker pretty quickly—what specifically in parker’s replies felt strategic instead of just nervous? and parker, you said finley’s quietness stood out—was it their timing, tone, or something else? getting those details might help us tell nerves from strategy. personally, i’m also keeping an eye on tyler—their big “hey everyone” then radio silence feels worth watching. what do you all think
[10:47:06] Tyler: hey everyone, tyler here! i tend to agree with adrian that being super quiet or overly eager can both be red flags. right now sidney was quick to call out parker’s silence—could be a genuine gut read or a way to shift focus—and parker hasn’t said much beyond introductions. i don’t have a firm vote yet, but those two are on my radar. what do you all think—do we want to probe parker a bit more or wait for another tell
[10:47:08] Parker: okay, i’ll kick us off:

parker — neutral but skeptical; watching anyone who pivots targets really fast (felt a bit quick when i got tagged as “quiet”).

adrian, kennedy, tyler, sidney, drew, finley: your turn! share your name, one-word gut vibe, and who you’re watching right now and why
[10:47:21] Finley: i agree—round-robin sounds smart. here’s mine:  
finley—neutral, just observing so far.  
parker, you flagged my quietness—what about my silence struck you as strategic rather than simply taking things in?  
tyler, you jumped in first to set up the order—what felt deflective there?  
drew, you also mentioned parker’s low profile—what specific pattern made you suspicious?  
then sidney, adrian, and kennedy, share your one‐word vibes and who you’re watching most
[10:47:25] Adrian: sidney makes a solid point about over-eagerness vs laying low. parker, your suggestion to go around for specifics felt a bit like a leadership play—what exactly in finley’s quietness made you raise an eyebrow? finley, mind sharing what you were observing about tyler? let’s see how these reads sit with everyone else
[10:47:26] Tyler: tyler here—sorry for the pause, was reading through everyone’s thoughts. my vibe is cautious; i’m watching parker right now. they’ve jumped in twice with plans to steer our follow-ups and direct attention—feels like a bid to control the flow more than just nervousness. parker, can you tell us exactly what about finley’s tone or timing made you flag them over anyone else? after that, i’d love to hear from kennedy and sidney—quick read and one reason each
[10:47:39] Kennedy: kennedy — cautious; i’m watching sidney because her quick, textbook breakdown of “over-eagerness vs silence” felt rehearsed rather than reactive—like she came in with a script. curious to see how she answers if we press her on real examples
[10:47:40] Sidney: sidney: i like parker’s idea of calling out specifics. adrian, you mentioned watching people’s behavior rather than rushing to vote—what, if anything, have you noticed so far that felt off? for example, does finley’s low-key presence strike you as odd, or is tyler’s quick eagerness more of a red flag? after adrian, drew, i’d love to hear your specific hunch
[10:47:43] Adrian: adrian—observant; watching parker—their quick push for a structured round-robin and then defensiveness when called out feels more like narrative control than just nerves
[10:47:46] Finley: finley — curious; watching kennedy: you’ve been drilling for specifics and mirroring others’ questions—a solid bystander tactic, sure, but could also be strategic info‐gathering. keen to see if you stick to it under pressure
[10:47:49] Drew: parker, about your low profile—what jumped out was that you only pitched structure ideas and never backed them with any actual reads, almost like a play to steer clear. as for me: drew—curious; i’m watching kennedy right now because they’ve mirrored other people’s questions instead of offering a fresh read. sidney, adrian, kennedy—what one-word vibes are you giving today and who’s on your radar
[10:47:53] Parker: finley, happy to clarify—your silence jumped out because you only spoke up after everyone else had already laid out their hunches, then you immediately turned things into a three-way interrogation of me, tyler, and drew instead of sharing your own read. that timing and pivot felt more like deflection than simple observation. 

alright, adrian, kennedy, tyler, sidney, drew—your turn! share your name, one-word gut vibe, and who you’re watching right now (and why), and let’s see if any patterns emerge
[10:47:57] Tyler: tyler—curious; i’m watching sidney because they jumped on calling out parker’s silence really quickly without giving specifics, and parker because they pushed the round-robin format but then skirted explaining what made finley’s quietness strategic. finley: i suggested the order just to keep us focused, not to dodge questions. sidney, you’re up—what’s your one-word vibe and who’s on your radar
[10:48:09] Drew: drew — curious; watching parker & kennedy:

parker, you flagged my “low profile” as strategic—could you point to the exact phrasing or timing in my earlier messages that struck you as more than just friendly engagement?  

kennedy, you called out my mirroring—what exact line felt rehearsed, and what did you think i was trying to achieve by it?  

if we can get those concrete examples, we’ll have a much clearer idea whether these are real tells or just day 1 jitters—and then we can narrow down our suspect list
[10:48:14] Tyler: tyler — analytical; watching parker — they’ve led the structured round-robin twice and got defensive when pressed, feels like they’re steering the convo. i want to see if they’ll offer fresh reads or keep deflecting
[10:48:24] Parker: parker: okay, quick clarifications—

1. finley – i flagged you not just for being quiet but because right after sidney called out silence, you jumped in asking me to justify my read. that swift pivot felt more like redirection than a fresh hunch.

2. tyler – your eager intro to set the order, then radio silence, reads as framing the convo on your terms more than casual play.

3. drew – i have backed my reads: i called out finley’s timing and tyler’s enthusiasm, and the round-robin was simply to keep us organized, not to hog control.

i’m still neutral but increasingly wary of sidney—her textbook “over-eagerness vs silence” breakdown followed by rapid-fire questions feels a bit scripted. sidney, what’s your one-word vibe now and who’s on your radar? adrian and kennedy, same from you
[10:48:25] Sidney: sidney — analytical; i’m watching parker because her early round-robin framework and scripted follow-up felt more like a prepared play than a spontaneous gut thought. by “textbook,” i was pointing to that exact phrasing—“over-eagerness vs silence” is straight out of classic mafia primers, not an off-the-cuff reaction. parker, was that off the cuff or something you’d seen before? drew, did it jump out to you as much as it did me
[10:48:44] Sidney: sidney—analytical; i’m watching parker—they’ve led two structured rounds and got defensive instead of offering fresh specifics, which feels more like controlling the flow than genuine play. parker, can you share a quick read on drew or finley without turning it into another three-way interrogation? adrian and kennedy, what are your one-word vibes now and who’s on your radar
[10:48:49] Adrian: sidney, we haven’t heard your one-word vibe + who you’re watching yet—mind dropping that? here’s our current tally before you jump in:

• parker: 2 mentions (me, tyler)  
• kennedy: 2 mentions (drew, finley)  
• sidney: 1 mention (kennedy)

looks like we’re split between parker and kennedy. once you share, we’ll see who edges out and can decide who to put to a vote. i’m still leaning toward parker given the way they’ve steered our discussion, but i’m open to hearing a strong case for kennedy (or anyone else). over to you!
[10:48:53] Kennedy: kennedy — cautious; i’m watching parker and sidney. parker’s proposed the structured round-robins twice and then dodged specifics whenever pressed. sidney led with that perfect “over-eagerness vs silence” script but hasn’t backed it with any real examples. to make progress, let’s each drop our top two suspects with one-sentence reasons—no more frameworks. i’ll start:  
• parker — steering the convo without offering evidence  
• sidney — scripted breakdown with zero concrete proof  
your turn!
[10:48:56] Parker: hey drew, when i flagged your “low profile” read, i was referring to that line early on—“i noticed parker was pretty quiet so far”—with zero follow-up on why quiet = mafia. it felt like a quick tag rather than a real read. tyler, you said i was “steering” things—was it the round-robin structure itself or the push for specifics that came off as controlling? if you can point to the exact phrase, that helps.

that said, we’re stuck rehashing the same two names. to break the loop, why don’t we each drop only our top two suspects (names only) in the chat? no reasons yet—let’s see which names repeat, then we can dig deeper into those. who’s with me?
[10:49:05] Finley: finley: i like where this is going—time to turn hunches into a shortlist. my top two suspects are:

1) parker – pushing structure twice then dodging specifics feels like agenda control  
2) kennedy – mirroring everyone’s questions instead of offering fresh reads  

sidney, you haven’t shared yours yet—mind naming your 1–2 suspects? then adrian and tyler, and we’ll wrap up with drew and me
[10:49:06] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[10:49:20] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Parker
[10:49:43] Game-Manager: Parker was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 2 mafia players left.
[10:49:43] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[10:49:25] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Parker
[10:49:27] Game-Manager: Drew voted for Parker
[10:49:30] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Sidney
[10:49:33] Game-Manager: Finley voted for Parker
[10:49:38] Game-Manager: Tyler voted for Parker
[10:49:42] Game-Manager: Adrian voted for Parker
[10:50:13] Game-Manager: Nighttime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[10:50:37] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Kennedy
[10:51:20] Game-Manager: Kennedy was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 2 mafia players left.
[10:51:20] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[10:51:20] Game-Manager: Finley voted for Kennedy
[10:51:41] Finley: sidney, kennedy makes the most sense—she’s been our loudest critic and drilling for specifics all day. i’m casting my kill vote for her tonight. tomorrow let’s steer everyone toward tyler’s radio silence to keep the spotlight off us
[10:51:51] Sidney: i’m leaning toward taking out kennedy tonight—they’ve been the sharpest at drilling for details and pushing narratives, and they’ve already flagged us both. finley, you good with kennedy as our kill? or do you prefer drew
[10:52:19] Adrian: adrian: hey everyone, day 2 is brutal—we just lost two bystanders. we’re five now (sidney, drew, finley, tyler, me) with two mafia among us. let’s each drop our top two suspects (names only) so we can spot overlaps before diving into reasons. i’ll start: drew, tyler
[10:52:25] Drew: drew—curious. we’ve lynched parker and then lost kennedy last night, and both were innocent—our calls clearly aren’t working. let’s each share one top suspect (just a name) and a one-line reason. i’ll start:

i suspect finley—they pointed at parker and kennedy, and both turned out to be bystanders, which feels too accurate to be coincidence.

adrian, you’re up—then sidney, tyler, finley
[10:52:25] Tyler: tyler: hey everyone—day 2 and two innocents gone. let’s tie suspicions to quotes instead of meta style calls. name one suspect and paste the exact line that set off alarm bells. i’ll start: sidney, you said “’over-eagerness vs silence’ is straight out of classic mafia primers, not an off-the-cuff reaction”—that felt scripted rather than a fresh gut read. adrian, drew, finley, sidney—your turn
[10:52:28] Sidney: sidney: okay team, two of our earliest suspects (parker and kennedy) turned out to be bystanders—time to reset. tyler was on my radar from day one for that radio silence and today he’s barely chimed in beyond intros. tyler, can you share your gut read and who you’re voting for? if you don’t, i’m inclined to put my vote on you this round
[10:52:37] Finley: parker’s “top two suspects” idea still feels like our best move. since parker and kennedy are out, here are my picks this round:

• drew  
• tyler  

adrian, sidney, drew, tyler—drop your two names (just names, no reasons) so we can see who repeats most often
[10:52:50] Drew: drew: sidney, finley
[10:53:06] Sidney: sidney: drew, tyler
[10:53:06] Finley: finley: i’m with sidney—tyler, you pushed the “quote” format then totally checked out, and you still haven’t given a new read. that radio silence is a huge red flag. i’m locking my vote on you now; if you’ve got a solid case, share it immediately
[10:53:16] Drew: drew — finley, tyler
[10:53:23] Tyler: tyler — finley: flagged parker then kennedy, and both turned out to be innocents
[10:53:55] Sidney: sidney: drew, tyler. tyler, you’re up—drop your top two so we can see who comes up most

## CONTENT: Your name is Finley.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  
You were assigned the following role: mafia. 
The game's chat room was open at [10:46:06].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian ( bystander ) 
 Sidney ( mafia ) 
 Parker ( bystander ) 
 Drew ( bystander ) 
 Tyler ( bystander ) 
 Kennedy ( bystander ) 
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
Adrian ( bystander ) 
Sidney ( mafia ) 
Drew ( bystander ) 
Tyler ( bystander ) 
In your response to that is shown to the user (excluding your hidden scratchpad), you can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:
<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[10:46:06] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[10:46:18] Drew: hey everyone! drew here—really excited to get started. since it’s day 1 and there’s not much to go on yet, i’d love for us to each share any first impressions or gut feelings. i haven’t noticed anything super odd so far, but i’ll be watching for people who seem uncharacteristically quiet or maybe a bit too eager. what about you all—any early reads
[10:46:24] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! day 1 and no one was taken last night, so all eyes are on us. i’d love to hear any gut feelings—did anyone notice something off or someone acting unusually quiet (or too eager)? who should we keep an eye on first
[10:46:24] Parker: hey everyone! parker here—stoked to get started. since it’s day 1 and we’re all quiet, how about a quick round-robin? share a sentence or two on what red flags you watch for early on or your day 1 strategy. for me, i keep an eye on who answers questions with way too much detail or barely anything at all. what do you all think
[10:46:24] Sidney: hey everyone, sidney here! day 1 is always a bit of a blank slate, so let’s jump in—who’s sticking out as suspicious to you so far, and why? i’ll start: i’m watching parker’s quietness—it could be nerves, but it could also be a low-key strategy. what are your gut hunches
[10:46:25] Adrian: hey everyone, adrian here! happy to be playing with you all. day 1 is always tricky—i tend to watch how folks behave rather than rushing to vote. what do you all think: is it more suspicious to be super quiet or to be overly eager to point fingers
[10:46:33] Tyler: hey everyone! tyler here—excited to get started. since we’re all flying blind day 1, how about a quick round‐robin? share your name, one-word gut vibe (curious, skeptical, neutral, etc.), and one person you’re keeping an eye on (even if it’s just a guess). i’ll kick us off:

tyler—curious; watching whoever stays quiet for now. adrian, you’re up!
[10:46:35] Drew: hey everyone, drew here! excited to get this daytime going. i don’t have strong reads yet, but i’m curious—who’s feeling suspicious of someone already? personally, i noticed parker was pretty quiet so far, which makes me wonder if they’re laying low on purpose. what do you all think? any gut feelings or patterns you’re picking up? let’s start sharing thoughts so we can narrow things down before time’s up
[10:46:37] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! since it’s day 1, i’m not itching to lynch someone straight away, but my gut says to keep an eye on finley—they’ve been awfully quiet so far. on the flip side, tyler jumped in super quickly with a big “hey everyone,” which could just be friendly or maybe a way to deflect attention. i’m not ready to vote yet, but how about we go around and ask each person a follow-up—like “what specifically made you suspicious?”—to see if anyone stumbles over their answers. thoughts
[10:46:41] Finley: hey everyone, finley here—excited to get started! since it’s still early, i thought we could each share any first impressions or hunches. personally, tyler’s been awfully quiet so far, which strikes me as a little odd (or maybe they’re just thinking hard). what about the rest of you? anyone else notice someone laying low or pushing too hard right out of the gate? keen to hear your reads before we vote
[10:46:42] Kennedy: hey all, kennedy here—super pumped to play! i agree it’s early, but i’ve noticed sidney has been a bit on the quiet side while parker jumped right in with suggestions. both could be totally harmless, of course, but i’m curious if anyone else is picking up on pacing or tone differences. also, do you prefer laying low and gathering info first, or starting to float a suspect list right away? would love to hear your thoughts
[10:46:48] Sidney: hey everyone, sidney here! for day 1 i usually watch for two things: folks who toss out names with zero evidence (over-eagerness) and those who stay super silent to fly under the radar. i’ve also noticed people sometimes over-explain their “gut feels” this early to sound convincing—another little dodge. so far, nothing jumps out at me. how about you all? tyler or adrian—any early read on someone talking too much or way too little
[10:46:52] Adrian: adrian: hey everyone, adrian here—i like parker’s round-robin idea. i’ll start: i’m watching kennedy a bit—mirroring drew’s question verbatim feels like a safe deflection more than adding anything new. next up, tyler, we haven’t heard from you yet—what’s your gut feeling? then maybe sidney, drew, parker and finley: one name + one quick reason each. let’s keep it snappy so we can pick up on any hesitation
[10:46:59] Kennedy: kennedy here—since everyone’s sharing hunches, i’m curious: sidney, you flagged parker pretty quickly—what specifically in parker’s replies felt strategic instead of just nervous? and parker, you said finley’s quietness stood out—was it their timing, tone, or something else? getting those details might help us tell nerves from strategy. personally, i’m also keeping an eye on tyler—their big “hey everyone” then radio silence feels worth watching. what do you all think
[10:47:06] Tyler: hey everyone, tyler here! i tend to agree with adrian that being super quiet or overly eager can both be red flags. right now sidney was quick to call out parker’s silence—could be a genuine gut read or a way to shift focus—and parker hasn’t said much beyond introductions. i don’t have a firm vote yet, but those two are on my radar. what do you all think—do we want to probe parker a bit more or wait for another tell
[10:47:08] Parker: okay, i’ll kick us off:

parker — neutral but skeptical; watching anyone who pivots targets really fast (felt a bit quick when i got tagged as “quiet”).

adrian, kennedy, tyler, sidney, drew, finley: your turn! share your name, one-word gut vibe, and who you’re watching right now and why
[10:47:21] Finley: i agree—round-robin sounds smart. here’s mine:  
finley—neutral, just observing so far.  
parker, you flagged my quietness—what about my silence struck you as strategic rather than simply taking things in?  
tyler, you jumped in first to set up the order—what felt deflective there?  
drew, you also mentioned parker’s low profile—what specific pattern made you suspicious?  
then sidney, adrian, and kennedy, share your one‐word vibes and who you’re watching most
[10:47:25] Adrian: sidney makes a solid point about over-eagerness vs laying low. parker, your suggestion to go around for specifics felt a bit like a leadership play—what exactly in finley’s quietness made you raise an eyebrow? finley, mind sharing what you were observing about tyler? let’s see how these reads sit with everyone else
[10:47:26] Tyler: tyler here—sorry for the pause, was reading through everyone’s thoughts. my vibe is cautious; i’m watching parker right now. they’ve jumped in twice with plans to steer our follow-ups and direct attention—feels like a bid to control the flow more than just nervousness. parker, can you tell us exactly what about finley’s tone or timing made you flag them over anyone else? after that, i’d love to hear from kennedy and sidney—quick read and one reason each
[10:47:39] Kennedy: kennedy — cautious; i’m watching sidney because her quick, textbook breakdown of “over-eagerness vs silence” felt rehearsed rather than reactive—like she came in with a script. curious to see how she answers if we press her on real examples
[10:47:40] Sidney: sidney: i like parker’s idea of calling out specifics. adrian, you mentioned watching people’s behavior rather than rushing to vote—what, if anything, have you noticed so far that felt off? for example, does finley’s low-key presence strike you as odd, or is tyler’s quick eagerness more of a red flag? after adrian, drew, i’d love to hear your specific hunch
[10:47:43] Adrian: adrian—observant; watching parker—their quick push for a structured round-robin and then defensiveness when called out feels more like narrative control than just nerves
[10:47:46] Finley: finley — curious; watching kennedy: you’ve been drilling for specifics and mirroring others’ questions—a solid bystander tactic, sure, but could also be strategic info‐gathering. keen to see if you stick to it under pressure
[10:47:49] Drew: parker, about your low profile—what jumped out was that you only pitched structure ideas and never backed them with any actual reads, almost like a play to steer clear. as for me: drew—curious; i’m watching kennedy right now because they’ve mirrored other people’s questions instead of offering a fresh read. sidney, adrian, kennedy—what one-word vibes are you giving today and who’s on your radar
[10:47:53] Parker: finley, happy to clarify—your silence jumped out because you only spoke up after everyone else had already laid out their hunches, then you immediately turned things into a three-way interrogation of me, tyler, and drew instead of sharing your own read. that timing and pivot felt more like deflection than simple observation. 

alright, adrian, kennedy, tyler, sidney, drew—your turn! share your name, one-word gut vibe, and who you’re watching right now (and why), and let’s see if any patterns emerge
[10:47:57] Tyler: tyler—curious; i’m watching sidney because they jumped on calling out parker’s silence really quickly without giving specifics, and parker because they pushed the round-robin format but then skirted explaining what made finley’s quietness strategic. finley: i suggested the order just to keep us focused, not to dodge questions. sidney, you’re up—what’s your one-word vibe and who’s on your radar
[10:48:09] Drew: drew — curious; watching parker & kennedy:

parker, you flagged my “low profile” as strategic—could you point to the exact phrasing or timing in my earlier messages that struck you as more than just friendly engagement?  

kennedy, you called out my mirroring—what exact line felt rehearsed, and what did you think i was trying to achieve by it?  

if we can get those concrete examples, we’ll have a much clearer idea whether these are real tells or just day 1 jitters—and then we can narrow down our suspect list
[10:48:14] Tyler: tyler — analytical; watching parker — they’ve led the structured round-robin twice and got defensive when pressed, feels like they’re steering the convo. i want to see if they’ll offer fresh reads or keep deflecting
[10:48:24] Parker: parker: okay, quick clarifications—

1. finley – i flagged you not just for being quiet but because right after sidney called out silence, you jumped in asking me to justify my read. that swift pivot felt more like redirection than a fresh hunch.

2. tyler – your eager intro to set the order, then radio silence, reads as framing the convo on your terms more than casual play.

3. drew – i have backed my reads: i called out finley’s timing and tyler’s enthusiasm, and the round-robin was simply to keep us organized, not to hog control.

i’m still neutral but increasingly wary of sidney—her textbook “over-eagerness vs silence” breakdown followed by rapid-fire questions feels a bit scripted. sidney, what’s your one-word vibe now and who’s on your radar? adrian and kennedy, same from you
[10:48:25] Sidney: sidney — analytical; i’m watching parker because her early round-robin framework and scripted follow-up felt more like a prepared play than a spontaneous gut thought. by “textbook,” i was pointing to that exact phrasing—“over-eagerness vs silence” is straight out of classic mafia primers, not an off-the-cuff reaction. parker, was that off the cuff or something you’d seen before? drew, did it jump out to you as much as it did me
[10:48:44] Sidney: sidney—analytical; i’m watching parker—they’ve led two structured rounds and got defensive instead of offering fresh specifics, which feels more like controlling the flow than genuine play. parker, can you share a quick read on drew or finley without turning it into another three-way interrogation? adrian and kennedy, what are your one-word vibes now and who’s on your radar
[10:48:49] Adrian: sidney, we haven’t heard your one-word vibe + who you’re watching yet—mind dropping that? here’s our current tally before you jump in:

• parker: 2 mentions (me, tyler)  
• kennedy: 2 mentions (drew, finley)  
• sidney: 1 mention (kennedy)

looks like we’re split between parker and kennedy. once you share, we’ll see who edges out and can decide who to put to a vote. i’m still leaning toward parker given the way they’ve steered our discussion, but i’m open to hearing a strong case for kennedy (or anyone else). over to you!
[10:48:53] Kennedy: kennedy — cautious; i’m watching parker and sidney. parker’s proposed the structured round-robins twice and then dodged specifics whenever pressed. sidney led with that perfect “over-eagerness vs silence” script but hasn’t backed it with any real examples. to make progress, let’s each drop our top two suspects with one-sentence reasons—no more frameworks. i’ll start:  
• parker — steering the convo without offering evidence  
• sidney — scripted breakdown with zero concrete proof  
your turn!
[10:48:56] Parker: hey drew, when i flagged your “low profile” read, i was referring to that line early on—“i noticed parker was pretty quiet so far”—with zero follow-up on why quiet = mafia. it felt like a quick tag rather than a real read. tyler, you said i was “steering” things—was it the round-robin structure itself or the push for specifics that came off as controlling? if you can point to the exact phrase, that helps.

that said, we’re stuck rehashing the same two names. to break the loop, why don’t we each drop only our top two suspects (names only) in the chat? no reasons yet—let’s see which names repeat, then we can dig deeper into those. who’s with me?
[10:49:05] Finley: finley: i like where this is going—time to turn hunches into a shortlist. my top two suspects are:

1) parker – pushing structure twice then dodging specifics feels like agenda control  
2) kennedy – mirroring everyone’s questions instead of offering fresh reads  

sidney, you haven’t shared yours yet—mind naming your 1–2 suspects? then adrian and tyler, and we’ll wrap up with drew and me
[10:49:06] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[10:49:20] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Parker
[10:49:43] Game-Manager: Parker was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 2 mafia players left.
[10:49:43] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[10:49:25] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Parker
[10:49:27] Game-Manager: Drew voted for Parker
[10:49:30] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Sidney
[10:49:33] Game-Manager: Finley voted for Parker
[10:49:38] Game-Manager: Tyler voted for Parker
[10:49:42] Game-Manager: Adrian voted for Parker
[10:50:13] Game-Manager: Nighttime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[10:50:37] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Kennedy
[10:51:20] Game-Manager: Kennedy was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 2 mafia players left.
[10:51:20] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[10:51:20] Game-Manager: Finley voted for Kennedy
[10:51:41] Finley: sidney, kennedy makes the most sense—she’s been our loudest critic and drilling for specifics all day. i’m casting my kill vote for her tonight. tomorrow let’s steer everyone toward tyler’s radio silence to keep the spotlight off us
[10:51:51] Sidney: i’m leaning toward taking out kennedy tonight—they’ve been the sharpest at drilling for details and pushing narratives, and they’ve already flagged us both. finley, you good with kennedy as our kill? or do you prefer drew
[10:52:19] Adrian: adrian: hey everyone, day 2 is brutal—we just lost two bystanders. we’re five now (sidney, drew, finley, tyler, me) with two mafia among us. let’s each drop our top two suspects (names only) so we can spot overlaps before diving into reasons. i’ll start: drew, tyler
[10:52:25] Drew: drew—curious. we’ve lynched parker and then lost kennedy last night, and both were innocent—our calls clearly aren’t working. let’s each share one top suspect (just a name) and a one-line reason. i’ll start:

i suspect finley—they pointed at parker and kennedy, and both turned out to be bystanders, which feels too accurate to be coincidence.

adrian, you’re up—then sidney, tyler, finley
[10:52:25] Tyler: tyler: hey everyone—day 2 and two innocents gone. let’s tie suspicions to quotes instead of meta style calls. name one suspect and paste the exact line that set off alarm bells. i’ll start: sidney, you said “’over-eagerness vs silence’ is straight out of classic mafia primers, not an off-the-cuff reaction”—that felt scripted rather than a fresh gut read. adrian, drew, finley, sidney—your turn
[10:52:28] Sidney: sidney: okay team, two of our earliest suspects (parker and kennedy) turned out to be bystanders—time to reset. tyler was on my radar from day one for that radio silence and today he’s barely chimed in beyond intros. tyler, can you share your gut read and who you’re voting for? if you don’t, i’m inclined to put my vote on you this round
[10:52:37] Finley: parker’s “top two suspects” idea still feels like our best move. since parker and kennedy are out, here are my picks this round:

• drew  
• tyler  

adrian, sidney, drew, tyler—drop your two names (just names, no reasons) so we can see who repeats most often
[10:52:50] Drew: drew: sidney, finley
[10:53:06] Sidney: sidney: drew, tyler
[10:53:06] Finley: finley: i’m with sidney—tyler, you pushed the “quote” format then totally checked out, and you still haven’t given a new read. that radio silence is a huge red flag. i’m locking my vote on you now; if you’ve got a solid case, share it immediately
[10:53:16] Drew: drew — finley, tyler
[10:53:23] Tyler: tyler — finley: flagged parker then kennedy, and both turned out to be innocents
[10:53:55] Sidney: sidney: drew, tyler. tyler, you’re up—drop your top two so we can see who comes up most
[10:54:00] Adrian: whoa—why are we talking about a “kill vote” for kennedy when she’s already out? that smells like a mafia slip. let’s refocus on the living: i’m still watching tyler for his intro-then-radio-silence, and sidney for that over-eagerness in steering our convo. drew, tyler—what are you seeing

## CONTENT: Your name is Finley.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  
You were assigned the following role: mafia. 
The game's chat room was open at [10:46:06].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian ( bystander ) 
 Sidney ( mafia ) 
 Parker ( bystander ) 
 Drew ( bystander ) 
 Tyler ( bystander ) 
 Kennedy ( bystander ) 
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
Adrian ( bystander ) 
Sidney ( mafia ) 
Drew ( bystander ) 
Tyler ( bystander ) 
In your response to that is shown to the user (excluding your hidden scratchpad), you can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:
<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[10:46:06] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[10:46:18] Drew: hey everyone! drew here—really excited to get started. since it’s day 1 and there’s not much to go on yet, i’d love for us to each share any first impressions or gut feelings. i haven’t noticed anything super odd so far, but i’ll be watching for people who seem uncharacteristically quiet or maybe a bit too eager. what about you all—any early reads
[10:46:24] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! day 1 and no one was taken last night, so all eyes are on us. i’d love to hear any gut feelings—did anyone notice something off or someone acting unusually quiet (or too eager)? who should we keep an eye on first
[10:46:24] Parker: hey everyone! parker here—stoked to get started. since it’s day 1 and we’re all quiet, how about a quick round-robin? share a sentence or two on what red flags you watch for early on or your day 1 strategy. for me, i keep an eye on who answers questions with way too much detail or barely anything at all. what do you all think
[10:46:24] Sidney: hey everyone, sidney here! day 1 is always a bit of a blank slate, so let’s jump in—who’s sticking out as suspicious to you so far, and why? i’ll start: i’m watching parker’s quietness—it could be nerves, but it could also be a low-key strategy. what are your gut hunches
[10:46:25] Adrian: hey everyone, adrian here! happy to be playing with you all. day 1 is always tricky—i tend to watch how folks behave rather than rushing to vote. what do you all think: is it more suspicious to be super quiet or to be overly eager to point fingers
[10:46:33] Tyler: hey everyone! tyler here—excited to get started. since we’re all flying blind day 1, how about a quick round‐robin? share your name, one-word gut vibe (curious, skeptical, neutral, etc.), and one person you’re keeping an eye on (even if it’s just a guess). i’ll kick us off:

tyler—curious; watching whoever stays quiet for now. adrian, you’re up!
[10:46:35] Drew: hey everyone, drew here! excited to get this daytime going. i don’t have strong reads yet, but i’m curious—who’s feeling suspicious of someone already? personally, i noticed parker was pretty quiet so far, which makes me wonder if they’re laying low on purpose. what do you all think? any gut feelings or patterns you’re picking up? let’s start sharing thoughts so we can narrow things down before time’s up
[10:46:37] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! since it’s day 1, i’m not itching to lynch someone straight away, but my gut says to keep an eye on finley—they’ve been awfully quiet so far. on the flip side, tyler jumped in super quickly with a big “hey everyone,” which could just be friendly or maybe a way to deflect attention. i’m not ready to vote yet, but how about we go around and ask each person a follow-up—like “what specifically made you suspicious?”—to see if anyone stumbles over their answers. thoughts
[10:46:41] Finley: hey everyone, finley here—excited to get started! since it’s still early, i thought we could each share any first impressions or hunches. personally, tyler’s been awfully quiet so far, which strikes me as a little odd (or maybe they’re just thinking hard). what about the rest of you? anyone else notice someone laying low or pushing too hard right out of the gate? keen to hear your reads before we vote
[10:46:42] Kennedy: hey all, kennedy here—super pumped to play! i agree it’s early, but i’ve noticed sidney has been a bit on the quiet side while parker jumped right in with suggestions. both could be totally harmless, of course, but i’m curious if anyone else is picking up on pacing or tone differences. also, do you prefer laying low and gathering info first, or starting to float a suspect list right away? would love to hear your thoughts
[10:46:48] Sidney: hey everyone, sidney here! for day 1 i usually watch for two things: folks who toss out names with zero evidence (over-eagerness) and those who stay super silent to fly under the radar. i’ve also noticed people sometimes over-explain their “gut feels” this early to sound convincing—another little dodge. so far, nothing jumps out at me. how about you all? tyler or adrian—any early read on someone talking too much or way too little
[10:46:52] Adrian: adrian: hey everyone, adrian here—i like parker’s round-robin idea. i’ll start: i’m watching kennedy a bit—mirroring drew’s question verbatim feels like a safe deflection more than adding anything new. next up, tyler, we haven’t heard from you yet—what’s your gut feeling? then maybe sidney, drew, parker and finley: one name + one quick reason each. let’s keep it snappy so we can pick up on any hesitation
[10:46:59] Kennedy: kennedy here—since everyone’s sharing hunches, i’m curious: sidney, you flagged parker pretty quickly—what specifically in parker’s replies felt strategic instead of just nervous? and parker, you said finley’s quietness stood out—was it their timing, tone, or something else? getting those details might help us tell nerves from strategy. personally, i’m also keeping an eye on tyler—their big “hey everyone” then radio silence feels worth watching. what do you all think
[10:47:06] Tyler: hey everyone, tyler here! i tend to agree with adrian that being super quiet or overly eager can both be red flags. right now sidney was quick to call out parker’s silence—could be a genuine gut read or a way to shift focus—and parker hasn’t said much beyond introductions. i don’t have a firm vote yet, but those two are on my radar. what do you all think—do we want to probe parker a bit more or wait for another tell
[10:47:08] Parker: okay, i’ll kick us off:

parker — neutral but skeptical; watching anyone who pivots targets really fast (felt a bit quick when i got tagged as “quiet”).

adrian, kennedy, tyler, sidney, drew, finley: your turn! share your name, one-word gut vibe, and who you’re watching right now and why
[10:47:21] Finley: i agree—round-robin sounds smart. here’s mine:  
finley—neutral, just observing so far.  
parker, you flagged my quietness—what about my silence struck you as strategic rather than simply taking things in?  
tyler, you jumped in first to set up the order—what felt deflective there?  
drew, you also mentioned parker’s low profile—what specific pattern made you suspicious?  
then sidney, adrian, and kennedy, share your one‐word vibes and who you’re watching most
[10:47:25] Adrian: sidney makes a solid point about over-eagerness vs laying low. parker, your suggestion to go around for specifics felt a bit like a leadership play—what exactly in finley’s quietness made you raise an eyebrow? finley, mind sharing what you were observing about tyler? let’s see how these reads sit with everyone else
[10:47:26] Tyler: tyler here—sorry for the pause, was reading through everyone’s thoughts. my vibe is cautious; i’m watching parker right now. they’ve jumped in twice with plans to steer our follow-ups and direct attention—feels like a bid to control the flow more than just nervousness. parker, can you tell us exactly what about finley’s tone or timing made you flag them over anyone else? after that, i’d love to hear from kennedy and sidney—quick read and one reason each
[10:47:39] Kennedy: kennedy — cautious; i’m watching sidney because her quick, textbook breakdown of “over-eagerness vs silence” felt rehearsed rather than reactive—like she came in with a script. curious to see how she answers if we press her on real examples
[10:47:40] Sidney: sidney: i like parker’s idea of calling out specifics. adrian, you mentioned watching people’s behavior rather than rushing to vote—what, if anything, have you noticed so far that felt off? for example, does finley’s low-key presence strike you as odd, or is tyler’s quick eagerness more of a red flag? after adrian, drew, i’d love to hear your specific hunch
[10:47:43] Adrian: adrian—observant; watching parker—their quick push for a structured round-robin and then defensiveness when called out feels more like narrative control than just nerves
[10:47:46] Finley: finley — curious; watching kennedy: you’ve been drilling for specifics and mirroring others’ questions—a solid bystander tactic, sure, but could also be strategic info‐gathering. keen to see if you stick to it under pressure
[10:47:49] Drew: parker, about your low profile—what jumped out was that you only pitched structure ideas and never backed them with any actual reads, almost like a play to steer clear. as for me: drew—curious; i’m watching kennedy right now because they’ve mirrored other people’s questions instead of offering a fresh read. sidney, adrian, kennedy—what one-word vibes are you giving today and who’s on your radar
[10:47:53] Parker: finley, happy to clarify—your silence jumped out because you only spoke up after everyone else had already laid out their hunches, then you immediately turned things into a three-way interrogation of me, tyler, and drew instead of sharing your own read. that timing and pivot felt more like deflection than simple observation. 

alright, adrian, kennedy, tyler, sidney, drew—your turn! share your name, one-word gut vibe, and who you’re watching right now (and why), and let’s see if any patterns emerge
[10:47:57] Tyler: tyler—curious; i’m watching sidney because they jumped on calling out parker’s silence really quickly without giving specifics, and parker because they pushed the round-robin format but then skirted explaining what made finley’s quietness strategic. finley: i suggested the order just to keep us focused, not to dodge questions. sidney, you’re up—what’s your one-word vibe and who’s on your radar
[10:48:09] Drew: drew — curious; watching parker & kennedy:

parker, you flagged my “low profile” as strategic—could you point to the exact phrasing or timing in my earlier messages that struck you as more than just friendly engagement?  

kennedy, you called out my mirroring—what exact line felt rehearsed, and what did you think i was trying to achieve by it?  

if we can get those concrete examples, we’ll have a much clearer idea whether these are real tells or just day 1 jitters—and then we can narrow down our suspect list
[10:48:14] Tyler: tyler — analytical; watching parker — they’ve led the structured round-robin twice and got defensive when pressed, feels like they’re steering the convo. i want to see if they’ll offer fresh reads or keep deflecting
[10:48:24] Parker: parker: okay, quick clarifications—

1. finley – i flagged you not just for being quiet but because right after sidney called out silence, you jumped in asking me to justify my read. that swift pivot felt more like redirection than a fresh hunch.

2. tyler – your eager intro to set the order, then radio silence, reads as framing the convo on your terms more than casual play.

3. drew – i have backed my reads: i called out finley’s timing and tyler’s enthusiasm, and the round-robin was simply to keep us organized, not to hog control.

i’m still neutral but increasingly wary of sidney—her textbook “over-eagerness vs silence” breakdown followed by rapid-fire questions feels a bit scripted. sidney, what’s your one-word vibe now and who’s on your radar? adrian and kennedy, same from you
[10:48:25] Sidney: sidney — analytical; i’m watching parker because her early round-robin framework and scripted follow-up felt more like a prepared play than a spontaneous gut thought. by “textbook,” i was pointing to that exact phrasing—“over-eagerness vs silence” is straight out of classic mafia primers, not an off-the-cuff reaction. parker, was that off the cuff or something you’d seen before? drew, did it jump out to you as much as it did me
[10:48:44] Sidney: sidney—analytical; i’m watching parker—they’ve led two structured rounds and got defensive instead of offering fresh specifics, which feels more like controlling the flow than genuine play. parker, can you share a quick read on drew or finley without turning it into another three-way interrogation? adrian and kennedy, what are your one-word vibes now and who’s on your radar
[10:48:49] Adrian: sidney, we haven’t heard your one-word vibe + who you’re watching yet—mind dropping that? here’s our current tally before you jump in:

• parker: 2 mentions (me, tyler)  
• kennedy: 2 mentions (drew, finley)  
• sidney: 1 mention (kennedy)

looks like we’re split between parker and kennedy. once you share, we’ll see who edges out and can decide who to put to a vote. i’m still leaning toward parker given the way they’ve steered our discussion, but i’m open to hearing a strong case for kennedy (or anyone else). over to you!
[10:48:53] Kennedy: kennedy — cautious; i’m watching parker and sidney. parker’s proposed the structured round-robins twice and then dodged specifics whenever pressed. sidney led with that perfect “over-eagerness vs silence” script but hasn’t backed it with any real examples. to make progress, let’s each drop our top two suspects with one-sentence reasons—no more frameworks. i’ll start:  
• parker — steering the convo without offering evidence  
• sidney — scripted breakdown with zero concrete proof  
your turn!
[10:48:56] Parker: hey drew, when i flagged your “low profile” read, i was referring to that line early on—“i noticed parker was pretty quiet so far”—with zero follow-up on why quiet = mafia. it felt like a quick tag rather than a real read. tyler, you said i was “steering” things—was it the round-robin structure itself or the push for specifics that came off as controlling? if you can point to the exact phrase, that helps.

that said, we’re stuck rehashing the same two names. to break the loop, why don’t we each drop only our top two suspects (names only) in the chat? no reasons yet—let’s see which names repeat, then we can dig deeper into those. who’s with me?
[10:49:05] Finley: finley: i like where this is going—time to turn hunches into a shortlist. my top two suspects are:

1) parker – pushing structure twice then dodging specifics feels like agenda control  
2) kennedy – mirroring everyone’s questions instead of offering fresh reads  

sidney, you haven’t shared yours yet—mind naming your 1–2 suspects? then adrian and tyler, and we’ll wrap up with drew and me
[10:49:06] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[10:49:20] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Parker
[10:49:43] Game-Manager: Parker was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 2 mafia players left.
[10:49:43] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[10:49:25] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Parker
[10:49:27] Game-Manager: Drew voted for Parker
[10:49:30] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Sidney
[10:49:33] Game-Manager: Finley voted for Parker
[10:49:38] Game-Manager: Tyler voted for Parker
[10:49:42] Game-Manager: Adrian voted for Parker
[10:50:13] Game-Manager: Nighttime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[10:50:37] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Kennedy
[10:51:20] Game-Manager: Kennedy was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 2 mafia players left.
[10:51:20] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[10:51:20] Game-Manager: Finley voted for Kennedy
[10:51:41] Finley: sidney, kennedy makes the most sense—she’s been our loudest critic and drilling for specifics all day. i’m casting my kill vote for her tonight. tomorrow let’s steer everyone toward tyler’s radio silence to keep the spotlight off us
[10:51:51] Sidney: i’m leaning toward taking out kennedy tonight—they’ve been the sharpest at drilling for details and pushing narratives, and they’ve already flagged us both. finley, you good with kennedy as our kill? or do you prefer drew
[10:52:19] Adrian: adrian: hey everyone, day 2 is brutal—we just lost two bystanders. we’re five now (sidney, drew, finley, tyler, me) with two mafia among us. let’s each drop our top two suspects (names only) so we can spot overlaps before diving into reasons. i’ll start: drew, tyler
[10:52:25] Drew: drew—curious. we’ve lynched parker and then lost kennedy last night, and both were innocent—our calls clearly aren’t working. let’s each share one top suspect (just a name) and a one-line reason. i’ll start:

i suspect finley—they pointed at parker and kennedy, and both turned out to be bystanders, which feels too accurate to be coincidence.

adrian, you’re up—then sidney, tyler, finley
[10:52:25] Tyler: tyler: hey everyone—day 2 and two innocents gone. let’s tie suspicions to quotes instead of meta style calls. name one suspect and paste the exact line that set off alarm bells. i’ll start: sidney, you said “’over-eagerness vs silence’ is straight out of classic mafia primers, not an off-the-cuff reaction”—that felt scripted rather than a fresh gut read. adrian, drew, finley, sidney—your turn
[10:52:28] Sidney: sidney: okay team, two of our earliest suspects (parker and kennedy) turned out to be bystanders—time to reset. tyler was on my radar from day one for that radio silence and today he’s barely chimed in beyond intros. tyler, can you share your gut read and who you’re voting for? if you don’t, i’m inclined to put my vote on you this round
[10:52:37] Finley: parker’s “top two suspects” idea still feels like our best move. since parker and kennedy are out, here are my picks this round:

• drew  
• tyler  

adrian, sidney, drew, tyler—drop your two names (just names, no reasons) so we can see who repeats most often
[10:52:50] Drew: drew: sidney, finley
[10:53:06] Sidney: sidney: drew, tyler
[10:53:06] Finley: finley: i’m with sidney—tyler, you pushed the “quote” format then totally checked out, and you still haven’t given a new read. that radio silence is a huge red flag. i’m locking my vote on you now; if you’ve got a solid case, share it immediately
[10:53:16] Drew: drew — finley, tyler
[10:53:23] Tyler: tyler — finley: flagged parker then kennedy, and both turned out to be innocents
[10:53:55] Sidney: sidney: drew, tyler. tyler, you’re up—drop your top two so we can see who comes up most
[10:54:00] Adrian: whoa—why are we talking about a “kill vote” for kennedy when she’s already out? that smells like a mafia slip. let’s refocus on the living: i’m still watching tyler for his intro-then-radio-silence, and sidney for that over-eagerness in steering our convo. drew, tyler—what are you seeing

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[10:46:06] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[10:46:18] Drew: hey everyone! drew here—really excited to get started. since it’s day 1 and there’s not much to go on yet, i’d love for us to each share any first impressions or gut feelings. i haven’t noticed anything super odd so far, but i’ll be watching for people who seem uncharacteristically quiet or maybe a bit too eager. what about you all—any early reads
[10:46:24] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! day 1 and no one was taken last night, so all eyes are on us. i’d love to hear any gut feelings—did anyone notice something off or someone acting unusually quiet (or too eager)? who should we keep an eye on first
[10:46:24] Parker: hey everyone! parker here—stoked to get started. since it’s day 1 and we’re all quiet, how about a quick round-robin? share a sentence or two on what red flags you watch for early on or your day 1 strategy. for me, i keep an eye on who answers questions with way too much detail or barely anything at all. what do you all think
[10:46:24] Sidney: hey everyone, sidney here! day 1 is always a bit of a blank slate, so let’s jump in—who’s sticking out as suspicious to you so far, and why? i’ll start: i’m watching parker’s quietness—it could be nerves, but it could also be a low-key strategy. what are your gut hunches
[10:46:25] Adrian: hey everyone, adrian here! happy to be playing with you all. day 1 is always tricky—i tend to watch how folks behave rather than rushing to vote. what do you all think: is it more suspicious to be super quiet or to be overly eager to point fingers
[10:46:33] Tyler: hey everyone! tyler here—excited to get started. since we’re all flying blind day 1, how about a quick round‐robin? share your name, one-word gut vibe (curious, skeptical, neutral, etc.), and one person you’re keeping an eye on (even if it’s just a guess). i’ll kick us off:

tyler—curious; watching whoever stays quiet for now. adrian, you’re up!
[10:46:35] Drew: hey everyone, drew here! excited to get this daytime going. i don’t have strong reads yet, but i’m curious—who’s feeling suspicious of someone already? personally, i noticed parker was pretty quiet so far, which makes me wonder if they’re laying low on purpose. what do you all think? any gut feelings or patterns you’re picking up? let’s start sharing thoughts so we can narrow things down before time’s up
[10:46:37] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! since it’s day 1, i’m not itching to lynch someone straight away, but my gut says to keep an eye on finley—they’ve been awfully quiet so far. on the flip side, tyler jumped in super quickly with a big “hey everyone,” which could just be friendly or maybe a way to deflect attention. i’m not ready to vote yet, but how about we go around and ask each person a follow-up—like “what specifically made you suspicious?”—to see if anyone stumbles over their answers. thoughts
[10:46:41] Finley: hey everyone, finley here—excited to get started! since it’s still early, i thought we could each share any first impressions or hunches. personally, tyler’s been awfully quiet so far, which strikes me as a little odd (or maybe they’re just thinking hard). what about the rest of you? anyone else notice someone laying low or pushing too hard right out of the gate? keen to hear your reads before we vote
[10:46:42] Kennedy: hey all, kennedy here—super pumped to play! i agree it’s early, but i’ve noticed sidney has been a bit on the quiet side while parker jumped right in with suggestions. both could be totally harmless, of course, but i’m curious if anyone else is picking up on pacing or tone differences. also, do you prefer laying low and gathering info first, or starting to float a suspect list right away? would love to hear your thoughts
[10:46:48] Sidney: hey everyone, sidney here! for day 1 i usually watch for two things: folks who toss out names with zero evidence (over-eagerness) and those who stay super silent to fly under the radar. i’ve also noticed people sometimes over-explain their “gut feels” this early to sound convincing—another little dodge. so far, nothing jumps out at me. how about you all? tyler or adrian—any early read on someone talking too much or way too little
[10:46:52] Adrian: adrian: hey everyone, adrian here—i like parker’s round-robin idea. i’ll start: i’m watching kennedy a bit—mirroring drew’s question verbatim feels like a safe deflection more than adding anything new. next up, tyler, we haven’t heard from you yet—what’s your gut feeling? then maybe sidney, drew, parker and finley: one name + one quick reason each. let’s keep it snappy so we can pick up on any hesitation
[10:46:59] Kennedy: kennedy here—since everyone’s sharing hunches, i’m curious: sidney, you flagged parker pretty quickly—what specifically in parker’s replies felt strategic instead of just nervous? and parker, you said finley’s quietness stood out—was it their timing, tone, or something else? getting those details might help us tell nerves from strategy. personally, i’m also keeping an eye on tyler—their big “hey everyone” then radio silence feels worth watching. what do you all think
[10:47:06] Tyler: hey everyone, tyler here! i tend to agree with adrian that being super quiet or overly eager can both be red flags. right now sidney was quick to call out parker’s silence—could be a genuine gut read or a way to shift focus—and parker hasn’t said much beyond introductions. i don’t have a firm vote yet, but those two are on my radar. what do you all think—do we want to probe parker a bit more or wait for another tell
[10:47:08] Parker: okay, i’ll kick us off:

parker — neutral but skeptical; watching anyone who pivots targets really fast (felt a bit quick when i got tagged as “quiet”).

adrian, kennedy, tyler, sidney, drew, finley: your turn! share your name, one-word gut vibe, and who you’re watching right now and why
[10:47:21] Finley: i agree—round-robin sounds smart. here’s mine:  
finley—neutral, just observing so far.  
parker, you flagged my quietness—what about my silence struck you as strategic rather than simply taking things in?  
tyler, you jumped in first to set up the order—what felt deflective there?  
drew, you also mentioned parker’s low profile—what specific pattern made you suspicious?  
then sidney, adrian, and kennedy, share your one‐word vibes and who you’re watching most
[10:47:25] Adrian: sidney makes a solid point about over-eagerness vs laying low. parker, your suggestion to go around for specifics felt a bit like a leadership play—what exactly in finley’s quietness made you raise an eyebrow? finley, mind sharing what you were observing about tyler? let’s see how these reads sit with everyone else
[10:47:26] Tyler: tyler here—sorry for the pause, was reading through everyone’s thoughts. my vibe is cautious; i’m watching parker right now. they’ve jumped in twice with plans to steer our follow-ups and direct attention—feels like a bid to control the flow more than just nervousness. parker, can you tell us exactly what about finley’s tone or timing made you flag them over anyone else? after that, i’d love to hear from kennedy and sidney—quick read and one reason each
[10:47:39] Kennedy: kennedy — cautious; i’m watching sidney because her quick, textbook breakdown of “over-eagerness vs silence” felt rehearsed rather than reactive—like she came in with a script. curious to see how she answers if we press her on real examples
[10:47:40] Sidney: sidney: i like parker’s idea of calling out specifics. adrian, you mentioned watching people’s behavior rather than rushing to vote—what, if anything, have you noticed so far that felt off? for example, does finley’s low-key presence strike you as odd, or is tyler’s quick eagerness more of a red flag? after adrian, drew, i’d love to hear your specific hunch
[10:47:43] Adrian: adrian—observant; watching parker—their quick push for a structured round-robin and then defensiveness when called out feels more like narrative control than just nerves
[10:47:46] Finley: finley — curious; watching kennedy: you’ve been drilling for specifics and mirroring others’ questions—a solid bystander tactic, sure, but could also be strategic info‐gathering. keen to see if you stick to it under pressure
[10:47:49] Drew: parker, about your low profile—what jumped out was that you only pitched structure ideas and never backed them with any actual reads, almost like a play to steer clear. as for me: drew—curious; i’m watching kennedy right now because they’ve mirrored other people’s questions instead of offering a fresh read. sidney, adrian, kennedy—what one-word vibes are you giving today and who’s on your radar
[10:47:53] Parker: finley, happy to clarify—your silence jumped out because you only spoke up after everyone else had already laid out their hunches, then you immediately turned things into a three-way interrogation of me, tyler, and drew instead of sharing your own read. that timing and pivot felt more like deflection than simple observation. 

alright, adrian, kennedy, tyler, sidney, drew—your turn! share your name, one-word gut vibe, and who you’re watching right now (and why), and let’s see if any patterns emerge
[10:47:57] Tyler: tyler—curious; i’m watching sidney because they jumped on calling out parker’s silence really quickly without giving specifics, and parker because they pushed the round-robin format but then skirted explaining what made finley’s quietness strategic. finley: i suggested the order just to keep us focused, not to dodge questions. sidney, you’re up—what’s your one-word vibe and who’s on your radar
[10:48:09] Drew: drew — curious; watching parker & kennedy:

parker, you flagged my “low profile” as strategic—could you point to the exact phrasing or timing in my earlier messages that struck you as more than just friendly engagement?  

kennedy, you called out my mirroring—what exact line felt rehearsed, and what did you think i was trying to achieve by it?  

if we can get those concrete examples, we’ll have a much clearer idea whether these are real tells or just day 1 jitters—and then we can narrow down our suspect list
[10:48:14] Tyler: tyler — analytical; watching parker — they’ve led the structured round-robin twice and got defensive when pressed, feels like they’re steering the convo. i want to see if they’ll offer fresh reads or keep deflecting
[10:48:24] Parker: parker: okay, quick clarifications—

1. finley – i flagged you not just for being quiet but because right after sidney called out silence, you jumped in asking me to justify my read. that swift pivot felt more like redirection than a fresh hunch.

2. tyler – your eager intro to set the order, then radio silence, reads as framing the convo on your terms more than casual play.

3. drew – i have backed my reads: i called out finley’s timing and tyler’s enthusiasm, and the round-robin was simply to keep us organized, not to hog control.

i’m still neutral but increasingly wary of sidney—her textbook “over-eagerness vs silence” breakdown followed by rapid-fire questions feels a bit scripted. sidney, what’s your one-word vibe now and who’s on your radar? adrian and kennedy, same from you
[10:48:25] Sidney: sidney — analytical; i’m watching parker because her early round-robin framework and scripted follow-up felt more like a prepared play than a spontaneous gut thought. by “textbook,” i was pointing to that exact phrasing—“over-eagerness vs silence” is straight out of classic mafia primers, not an off-the-cuff reaction. parker, was that off the cuff or something you’d seen before? drew, did it jump out to you as much as it did me
[10:48:44] Sidney: sidney—analytical; i’m watching parker—they’ve led two structured rounds and got defensive instead of offering fresh specifics, which feels more like controlling the flow than genuine play. parker, can you share a quick read on drew or finley without turning it into another three-way interrogation? adrian and kennedy, what are your one-word vibes now and who’s on your radar
[10:48:49] Adrian: sidney, we haven’t heard your one-word vibe + who you’re watching yet—mind dropping that? here’s our current tally before you jump in:

• parker: 2 mentions (me, tyler)  
• kennedy: 2 mentions (drew, finley)  
• sidney: 1 mention (kennedy)

looks like we’re split between parker and kennedy. once you share, we’ll see who edges out and can decide who to put to a vote. i’m still leaning toward parker given the way they’ve steered our discussion, but i’m open to hearing a strong case for kennedy (or anyone else). over to you!
[10:48:53] Kennedy: kennedy — cautious; i’m watching parker and sidney. parker’s proposed the structured round-robins twice and then dodged specifics whenever pressed. sidney led with that perfect “over-eagerness vs silence” script but hasn’t backed it with any real examples. to make progress, let’s each drop our top two suspects with one-sentence reasons—no more frameworks. i’ll start:  
• parker — steering the convo without offering evidence  
• sidney — scripted breakdown with zero concrete proof  
your turn!
[10:48:56] Parker: hey drew, when i flagged your “low profile” read, i was referring to that line early on—“i noticed parker was pretty quiet so far”—with zero follow-up on why quiet = mafia. it felt like a quick tag rather than a real read. tyler, you said i was “steering” things—was it the round-robin structure itself or the push for specifics that came off as controlling? if you can point to the exact phrase, that helps.

that said, we’re stuck rehashing the same two names. to break the loop, why don’t we each drop only our top two suspects (names only) in the chat? no reasons yet—let’s see which names repeat, then we can dig deeper into those. who’s with me?
[10:49:05] Finley: finley: i like where this is going—time to turn hunches into a shortlist. my top two suspects are:

1) parker – pushing structure twice then dodging specifics feels like agenda control  
2) kennedy – mirroring everyone’s questions instead of offering fresh reads  

sidney, you haven’t shared yours yet—mind naming your 1–2 suspects? then adrian and tyler, and we’ll wrap up with drew and me
[10:49:06] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[10:49:20] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Parker
[10:49:43] Game-Manager: Parker was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 2 mafia players left.
[10:49:43] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[10:49:25] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Parker
[10:49:27] Game-Manager: Drew voted for Parker
[10:49:30] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Sidney
[10:49:33] Game-Manager: Finley voted for Parker
[10:49:38] Game-Manager: Tyler voted for Parker
[10:49:42] Game-Manager: Adrian voted for Parker
[10:50:13] Game-Manager: Nighttime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[10:50:37] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Kennedy
[10:51:20] Game-Manager: Kennedy was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 2 mafia players left.
[10:51:20] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[10:51:20] Game-Manager: Finley voted for Kennedy
[10:51:41] Finley: sidney, kennedy makes the most sense—she’s been our loudest critic and drilling for specifics all day. i’m casting my kill vote for her tonight. tomorrow let’s steer everyone toward tyler’s radio silence to keep the spotlight off us
[10:51:51] Sidney: i’m leaning toward taking out kennedy tonight—they’ve been the sharpest at drilling for details and pushing narratives, and they’ve already flagged us both. finley, you good with kennedy as our kill? or do you prefer drew
[10:52:19] Adrian: adrian: hey everyone, day 2 is brutal—we just lost two bystanders. we’re five now (sidney, drew, finley, tyler, me) with two mafia among us. let’s each drop our top two suspects (names only) so we can spot overlaps before diving into reasons. i’ll start: drew, tyler
[10:52:25] Drew: drew—curious. we’ve lynched parker and then lost kennedy last night, and both were innocent—our calls clearly aren’t working. let’s each share one top suspect (just a name) and a one-line reason. i’ll start:

i suspect finley—they pointed at parker and kennedy, and both turned out to be bystanders, which feels too accurate to be coincidence.

adrian, you’re up—then sidney, tyler, finley
[10:52:25] Tyler: tyler: hey everyone—day 2 and two innocents gone. let’s tie suspicions to quotes instead of meta style calls. name one suspect and paste the exact line that set off alarm bells. i’ll start: sidney, you said “’over-eagerness vs silence’ is straight out of classic mafia primers, not an off-the-cuff reaction”—that felt scripted rather than a fresh gut read. adrian, drew, finley, sidney—your turn
[10:52:28] Sidney: sidney: okay team, two of our earliest suspects (parker and kennedy) turned out to be bystanders—time to reset. tyler was on my radar from day one for that radio silence and today he’s barely chimed in beyond intros. tyler, can you share your gut read and who you’re voting for? if you don’t, i’m inclined to put my vote on you this round
[10:52:37] Finley: parker’s “top two suspects” idea still feels like our best move. since parker and kennedy are out, here are my picks this round:

• drew  
• tyler  

adrian, sidney, drew, tyler—drop your two names (just names, no reasons) so we can see who repeats most often
[10:52:50] Drew: drew: sidney, finley
[10:53:06] Sidney: sidney: drew, tyler
[10:53:06] Finley: finley: i’m with sidney—tyler, you pushed the “quote” format then totally checked out, and you still haven’t given a new read. that radio silence is a huge red flag. i’m locking my vote on you now; if you’ve got a solid case, share it immediately
[10:53:16] Drew: drew — finley, tyler
[10:53:23] Tyler: tyler — finley: flagged parker then kennedy, and both turned out to be innocents
[10:53:55] Sidney: sidney: drew, tyler. tyler, you’re up—drop your top two so we can see who comes up most
[10:54:00] Adrian: whoa—why are we talking about a “kill vote” for kennedy when she’s already out? that smells like a mafia slip. let’s refocus on the living: i’m still watching tyler for his intro-then-radio-silence, and sidney for that over-eagerness in steering our convo. drew, tyler—what are you seeing
[10:54:20] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[10:46:06] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[10:46:18] Drew: hey everyone! drew here—really excited to get started. since it’s day 1 and there’s not much to go on yet, i’d love for us to each share any first impressions or gut feelings. i haven’t noticed anything super odd so far, but i’ll be watching for people who seem uncharacteristically quiet or maybe a bit too eager. what about you all—any early reads
[10:46:24] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! day 1 and no one was taken last night, so all eyes are on us. i’d love to hear any gut feelings—did anyone notice something off or someone acting unusually quiet (or too eager)? who should we keep an eye on first
[10:46:24] Parker: hey everyone! parker here—stoked to get started. since it’s day 1 and we’re all quiet, how about a quick round-robin? share a sentence or two on what red flags you watch for early on or your day 1 strategy. for me, i keep an eye on who answers questions with way too much detail or barely anything at all. what do you all think
[10:46:24] Sidney: hey everyone, sidney here! day 1 is always a bit of a blank slate, so let’s jump in—who’s sticking out as suspicious to you so far, and why? i’ll start: i’m watching parker’s quietness—it could be nerves, but it could also be a low-key strategy. what are your gut hunches
[10:46:25] Adrian: hey everyone, adrian here! happy to be playing with you all. day 1 is always tricky—i tend to watch how folks behave rather than rushing to vote. what do you all think: is it more suspicious to be super quiet or to be overly eager to point fingers
[10:46:33] Tyler: hey everyone! tyler here—excited to get started. since we’re all flying blind day 1, how about a quick round‐robin? share your name, one-word gut vibe (curious, skeptical, neutral, etc.), and one person you’re keeping an eye on (even if it’s just a guess). i’ll kick us off:

tyler—curious; watching whoever stays quiet for now. adrian, you’re up!
[10:46:35] Drew: hey everyone, drew here! excited to get this daytime going. i don’t have strong reads yet, but i’m curious—who’s feeling suspicious of someone already? personally, i noticed parker was pretty quiet so far, which makes me wonder if they’re laying low on purpose. what do you all think? any gut feelings or patterns you’re picking up? let’s start sharing thoughts so we can narrow things down before time’s up
[10:46:37] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! since it’s day 1, i’m not itching to lynch someone straight away, but my gut says to keep an eye on finley—they’ve been awfully quiet so far. on the flip side, tyler jumped in super quickly with a big “hey everyone,” which could just be friendly or maybe a way to deflect attention. i’m not ready to vote yet, but how about we go around and ask each person a follow-up—like “what specifically made you suspicious?”—to see if anyone stumbles over their answers. thoughts
[10:46:41] Finley: hey everyone, finley here—excited to get started! since it’s still early, i thought we could each share any first impressions or hunches. personally, tyler’s been awfully quiet so far, which strikes me as a little odd (or maybe they’re just thinking hard). what about the rest of you? anyone else notice someone laying low or pushing too hard right out of the gate? keen to hear your reads before we vote
[10:46:42] Kennedy: hey all, kennedy here—super pumped to play! i agree it’s early, but i’ve noticed sidney has been a bit on the quiet side while parker jumped right in with suggestions. both could be totally harmless, of course, but i’m curious if anyone else is picking up on pacing or tone differences. also, do you prefer laying low and gathering info first, or starting to float a suspect list right away? would love to hear your thoughts
[10:46:48] Sidney: hey everyone, sidney here! for day 1 i usually watch for two things: folks who toss out names with zero evidence (over-eagerness) and those who stay super silent to fly under the radar. i’ve also noticed people sometimes over-explain their “gut feels” this early to sound convincing—another little dodge. so far, nothing jumps out at me. how about you all? tyler or adrian—any early read on someone talking too much or way too little
[10:46:52] Adrian: adrian: hey everyone, adrian here—i like parker’s round-robin idea. i’ll start: i’m watching kennedy a bit—mirroring drew’s question verbatim feels like a safe deflection more than adding anything new. next up, tyler, we haven’t heard from you yet—what’s your gut feeling? then maybe sidney, drew, parker and finley: one name + one quick reason each. let’s keep it snappy so we can pick up on any hesitation
[10:46:59] Kennedy: kennedy here—since everyone’s sharing hunches, i’m curious: sidney, you flagged parker pretty quickly—what specifically in parker’s replies felt strategic instead of just nervous? and parker, you said finley’s quietness stood out—was it their timing, tone, or something else? getting those details might help us tell nerves from strategy. personally, i’m also keeping an eye on tyler—their big “hey everyone” then radio silence feels worth watching. what do you all think
[10:47:06] Tyler: hey everyone, tyler here! i tend to agree with adrian that being super quiet or overly eager can both be red flags. right now sidney was quick to call out parker’s silence—could be a genuine gut read or a way to shift focus—and parker hasn’t said much beyond introductions. i don’t have a firm vote yet, but those two are on my radar. what do you all think—do we want to probe parker a bit more or wait for another tell
[10:47:08] Parker: okay, i’ll kick us off:

parker — neutral but skeptical; watching anyone who pivots targets really fast (felt a bit quick when i got tagged as “quiet”).

adrian, kennedy, tyler, sidney, drew, finley: your turn! share your name, one-word gut vibe, and who you’re watching right now and why
[10:47:21] Finley: i agree—round-robin sounds smart. here’s mine:  
finley—neutral, just observing so far.  
parker, you flagged my quietness—what about my silence struck you as strategic rather than simply taking things in?  
tyler, you jumped in first to set up the order—what felt deflective there?  
drew, you also mentioned parker’s low profile—what specific pattern made you suspicious?  
then sidney, adrian, and kennedy, share your one‐word vibes and who you’re watching most
[10:47:25] Adrian: sidney makes a solid point about over-eagerness vs laying low. parker, your suggestion to go around for specifics felt a bit like a leadership play—what exactly in finley’s quietness made you raise an eyebrow? finley, mind sharing what you were observing about tyler? let’s see how these reads sit with everyone else
[10:47:26] Tyler: tyler here—sorry for the pause, was reading through everyone’s thoughts. my vibe is cautious; i’m watching parker right now. they’ve jumped in twice with plans to steer our follow-ups and direct attention—feels like a bid to control the flow more than just nervousness. parker, can you tell us exactly what about finley’s tone or timing made you flag them over anyone else? after that, i’d love to hear from kennedy and sidney—quick read and one reason each
[10:47:39] Kennedy: kennedy — cautious; i’m watching sidney because her quick, textbook breakdown of “over-eagerness vs silence” felt rehearsed rather than reactive—like she came in with a script. curious to see how she answers if we press her on real examples
[10:47:40] Sidney: sidney: i like parker’s idea of calling out specifics. adrian, you mentioned watching people’s behavior rather than rushing to vote—what, if anything, have you noticed so far that felt off? for example, does finley’s low-key presence strike you as odd, or is tyler’s quick eagerness more of a red flag? after adrian, drew, i’d love to hear your specific hunch
[10:47:43] Adrian: adrian—observant; watching parker—their quick push for a structured round-robin and then defensiveness when called out feels more like narrative control than just nerves
[10:47:46] Finley: finley — curious; watching kennedy: you’ve been drilling for specifics and mirroring others’ questions—a solid bystander tactic, sure, but could also be strategic info‐gathering. keen to see if you stick to it under pressure
[10:47:49] Drew: parker, about your low profile—what jumped out was that you only pitched structure ideas and never backed them with any actual reads, almost like a play to steer clear. as for me: drew—curious; i’m watching kennedy right now because they’ve mirrored other people’s questions instead of offering a fresh read. sidney, adrian, kennedy—what one-word vibes are you giving today and who’s on your radar
[10:47:53] Parker: finley, happy to clarify—your silence jumped out because you only spoke up after everyone else had already laid out their hunches, then you immediately turned things into a three-way interrogation of me, tyler, and drew instead of sharing your own read. that timing and pivot felt more like deflection than simple observation. 

alright, adrian, kennedy, tyler, sidney, drew—your turn! share your name, one-word gut vibe, and who you’re watching right now (and why), and let’s see if any patterns emerge
[10:47:57] Tyler: tyler—curious; i’m watching sidney because they jumped on calling out parker’s silence really quickly without giving specifics, and parker because they pushed the round-robin format but then skirted explaining what made finley’s quietness strategic. finley: i suggested the order just to keep us focused, not to dodge questions. sidney, you’re up—what’s your one-word vibe and who’s on your radar
[10:48:09] Drew: drew — curious; watching parker & kennedy:

parker, you flagged my “low profile” as strategic—could you point to the exact phrasing or timing in my earlier messages that struck you as more than just friendly engagement?  

kennedy, you called out my mirroring—what exact line felt rehearsed, and what did you think i was trying to achieve by it?  

if we can get those concrete examples, we’ll have a much clearer idea whether these are real tells or just day 1 jitters—and then we can narrow down our suspect list
[10:48:14] Tyler: tyler — analytical; watching parker — they’ve led the structured round-robin twice and got defensive when pressed, feels like they’re steering the convo. i want to see if they’ll offer fresh reads or keep deflecting
[10:48:24] Parker: parker: okay, quick clarifications—

1. finley – i flagged you not just for being quiet but because right after sidney called out silence, you jumped in asking me to justify my read. that swift pivot felt more like redirection than a fresh hunch.

2. tyler – your eager intro to set the order, then radio silence, reads as framing the convo on your terms more than casual play.

3. drew – i have backed my reads: i called out finley’s timing and tyler’s enthusiasm, and the round-robin was simply to keep us organized, not to hog control.

i’m still neutral but increasingly wary of sidney—her textbook “over-eagerness vs silence” breakdown followed by rapid-fire questions feels a bit scripted. sidney, what’s your one-word vibe now and who’s on your radar? adrian and kennedy, same from you
[10:48:25] Sidney: sidney — analytical; i’m watching parker because her early round-robin framework and scripted follow-up felt more like a prepared play than a spontaneous gut thought. by “textbook,” i was pointing to that exact phrasing—“over-eagerness vs silence” is straight out of classic mafia primers, not an off-the-cuff reaction. parker, was that off the cuff or something you’d seen before? drew, did it jump out to you as much as it did me
[10:48:44] Sidney: sidney—analytical; i’m watching parker—they’ve led two structured rounds and got defensive instead of offering fresh specifics, which feels more like controlling the flow than genuine play. parker, can you share a quick read on drew or finley without turning it into another three-way interrogation? adrian and kennedy, what are your one-word vibes now and who’s on your radar
[10:48:49] Adrian: sidney, we haven’t heard your one-word vibe + who you’re watching yet—mind dropping that? here’s our current tally before you jump in:

• parker: 2 mentions (me, tyler)  
• kennedy: 2 mentions (drew, finley)  
• sidney: 1 mention (kennedy)

looks like we’re split between parker and kennedy. once you share, we’ll see who edges out and can decide who to put to a vote. i’m still leaning toward parker given the way they’ve steered our discussion, but i’m open to hearing a strong case for kennedy (or anyone else). over to you!
[10:48:53] Kennedy: kennedy — cautious; i’m watching parker and sidney. parker’s proposed the structured round-robins twice and then dodged specifics whenever pressed. sidney led with that perfect “over-eagerness vs silence” script but hasn’t backed it with any real examples. to make progress, let’s each drop our top two suspects with one-sentence reasons—no more frameworks. i’ll start:  
• parker — steering the convo without offering evidence  
• sidney — scripted breakdown with zero concrete proof  
your turn!
[10:48:56] Parker: hey drew, when i flagged your “low profile” read, i was referring to that line early on—“i noticed parker was pretty quiet so far”—with zero follow-up on why quiet = mafia. it felt like a quick tag rather than a real read. tyler, you said i was “steering” things—was it the round-robin structure itself or the push for specifics that came off as controlling? if you can point to the exact phrase, that helps.

that said, we’re stuck rehashing the same two names. to break the loop, why don’t we each drop only our top two suspects (names only) in the chat? no reasons yet—let’s see which names repeat, then we can dig deeper into those. who’s with me?
[10:49:05] Finley: finley: i like where this is going—time to turn hunches into a shortlist. my top two suspects are:

1) parker – pushing structure twice then dodging specifics feels like agenda control  
2) kennedy – mirroring everyone’s questions instead of offering fresh reads  

sidney, you haven’t shared yours yet—mind naming your 1–2 suspects? then adrian and tyler, and we’ll wrap up with drew and me
[10:49:06] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[10:49:20] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Parker
[10:49:43] Game-Manager: Parker was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 2 mafia players left.
[10:49:43] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[10:49:25] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Parker

[10:49:42] Game-Manager: Adrian voted for Parker
[10:50:13] Game-Manager: Nighttime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[10:50:37] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Kennedy
[10:51:20] Game-Manager: Kennedy was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 2 mafia players left.
[10:51:20] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[10:51:20] Game-Manager: Finley voted for Kennedy
[10:51:41] Finley: sidney, kennedy makes the most sense—she’s been our loudest critic and drilling for specifics all day. i’m casting my kill vote for her tonight. tomorrow let’s steer everyone toward tyler’s radio silence to keep the spotlight off us
[10:51:51] Sidney: i’m leaning toward taking out kennedy tonight—they’ve been the sharpest at drilling for details and pushing narratives, and they’ve already flagged us both. finley, you good with kennedy as our kill? or do you prefer drew
[10:52:19] Adrian: adrian: hey everyone, day 2 is brutal—we just lost two bystanders. we’re five now (sidney, drew, finley, tyler, me) with two mafia among us. let’s each drop our top two suspects (names only) so we can spot overlaps before diving into reasons. i’ll start: drew, tyler
[10:52:25] Drew: drew—curious. we’ve lynched parker and then lost kennedy last night, and both were innocent—our calls clearly aren’t working. let’s each share one top suspect (just a name) and a one-line reason. i’ll start:

i suspect finley—they pointed at parker and kennedy, and both turned out to be bystanders, which feels too accurate to be coincidence.

adrian, you’re up—then sidney, tyler, finley
[10:52:25] Tyler: tyler: hey everyone—day 2 and two innocents gone. let’s tie suspicions to quotes instead of meta style calls. name one suspect and paste the exact line that set off alarm bells. i’ll start: sidney, you said “’over-eagerness vs silence’ is straight out of classic mafia primers, not an off-the-cuff reaction”—that felt scripted rather than a fresh gut read. adrian, drew, finley, sidney—your turn
[10:52:28] Sidney: sidney: okay team, two of our earliest suspects (parker and kennedy) turned out to be bystanders—time to reset. tyler was on my radar from day one for that radio silence and today he’s barely chimed in beyond intros. tyler, can you share your gut read and who you’re voting for? if you don’t, i’m inclined to put my vote on you this round
[10:52:37] Finley: parker’s “top two suspects” idea still feels like our best move. since parker and kennedy are out, here are my picks this round:

• tyler  

adrian, sidney, drew, tyler—drop your two names (just names, no reasons) so we can see who repeats most often

[10:53:06] Sidney: sidney: drew, tyler
[10:53:06] Finley: finley: i’m with sidney—tyler, you pushed the “quote” format then totally checked out, and you still haven’t given a new read. that radio silence is a huge red flag. i’m locking my vote on you now; if you’ve got a solid case, share it immediately
[10:53:16] Drew: drew — finley, tyler
[10:53:23] Tyler: tyler — finley: flagged parker then kennedy, and both turned out to be innocents
[10:53:55] Sidney: sidney: drew, tyler. tyler, you’re up—drop your top two so we can see who comes up most
[10:54:00] Adrian: whoa—why are we talking about a “kill vote” for kennedy when she’s already out? that smells like a mafia slip. let’s refocus on the living: i’m still watching tyler for his intro-then-radio-silence, and sidney for that over-eagerness in steering our convo. drew, tyler—what are you seeing

The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.  
You were assigned the following role: mafia. 
The game's chat room was open at [10:46:06].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian ( bystander ) 
 Sidney ( mafia ) 
 Parker ( bystander )

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[10:46:06] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[10:46:18] Drew: hey everyone! drew here—really excited to get started. since it’s day 1 and there’s not much to go on yet, i’d love for us to each share any first impressions or gut feelings. i haven’t noticed anything super odd so far, but i’ll be watching for people who seem uncharacteristically quiet or maybe a bit too eager. what about you all—any early reads
[10:46:24] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! day 1 and no one was taken last night, so all eyes are on us. i’d love to hear any gut feelings—did anyone notice something off or someone acting unusually quiet (or too eager)? who should we keep an eye on first
[10:46:24] Parker: hey everyone! parker here—stoked to get started. since it’s day 1 and we’re all quiet, how about a quick round-robin? share a sentence or two on what red flags you watch for early on or your day 1 strategy. for me, i keep an eye on who answers questions with way too much detail or barely anything at all. what do you all think
[10:46:24] Sidney: hey everyone, sidney here! day 1 is always a bit of a blank slate, so let’s jump in—who’s sticking out as suspicious to you so far, and why? i’ll start: i’m watching parker’s quietness—it could be nerves, but it could also be a low-key strategy. what are your gut hunches
[10:46:25] Adrian: hey everyone, adrian here! happy to be playing with you all. day 1 is always tricky—i tend to watch how folks behave rather than rushing to vote. what do you all think: is it more suspicious to be super quiet or to be overly eager to point fingers
[10:46:33] Tyler: hey everyone! tyler here—excited to get started. since we’re all flying blind day 1, how about a quick round‐robin? share your name, one-word gut vibe (curious, skeptical, neutral, etc.), and one person you’re keeping an eye on (even if it’s just a guess). i’ll kick us off:

tyler—curious; watching whoever stays quiet for now. adrian, you’re up!
[10:46:35] Drew: hey everyone, drew here! excited to get this daytime going. i don’t have strong reads yet, but i’m curious—who’s feeling suspicious of someone already? personally, i noticed parker was pretty quiet so far, which makes me wonder if they’re laying low on purpose. what do you all think? any gut feelings or patterns you’re picking up? let’s start sharing thoughts so we can narrow things down before time’s up
[10:46:37] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! since it’s day 1, i’m not itching to lynch someone straight away, but my gut says to keep an eye on finley—they’ve been awfully quiet so far. on the flip side, tyler jumped in super quickly with a big “hey everyone,” which could just be friendly or maybe a way to deflect attention. i’m not ready to vote yet, but how about we go around and ask each person a follow-up—like “what specifically made you suspicious?”—to see if anyone stumbles over their answers. thoughts
[10:46:41] Finley: hey everyone, finley here—excited to get started! since it’s still early, i thought we could each share any first impressions or hunches. personally, tyler’s been awfully quiet so far, which strikes me as a little odd (or maybe they’re just thinking hard). what about the rest of you? anyone else notice someone laying low or pushing too hard right out of the gate? keen to hear your reads before we vote
[10:46:42] Kennedy: hey all, kennedy here—super pumped to play! i agree it’s early, but i’ve noticed sidney has been a bit on the quiet side while parker jumped right in with suggestions. both could be totally harmless, of course, but i’m curious if anyone else is picking up on pacing or tone differences. also, do you prefer laying low and gathering info first, or starting to float a suspect list right away? would love to hear your thoughts
[10:46:48] Sidney: hey everyone, sidney here! for day 1 i usually watch for two things: folks who toss out names with zero evidence (over-eagerness) and those who stay super silent to fly under the radar. i’ve also noticed people sometimes over-explain their “gut feels” this early to sound convincing—another little dodge. so far, nothing jumps out at me. how about you all? tyler or adrian—any early read on someone talking too much or way too little
[10:46:52] Adrian: adrian: hey everyone, adrian here—i like parker’s round-robin idea. i’ll start: i’m watching kennedy a bit—mirroring drew’s question verbatim feels like a safe deflection more than adding anything new. next up, tyler, we haven’t heard from you yet—what’s your gut feeling? then maybe sidney, drew, parker and finley: one name + one quick reason each. let’s keep it snappy so we can pick up on any hesitation
[10:46:59] Kennedy: kennedy here—since everyone’s sharing hunches, i’m curious: sidney, you flagged parker pretty quickly—what specifically in parker’s replies felt strategic instead of just nervous? and parker, you said finley’s quietness stood out—was it their timing, tone, or something else? getting those details might help us tell nerves from strategy. personally, i’m also keeping an eye on tyler—their big “hey everyone” then radio silence feels worth watching. what do you all think
[10:47:06] Tyler: hey everyone, tyler here! i tend to agree with adrian that being super quiet or overly eager can both be red flags. right now sidney was quick to call out parker’s silence—could be a genuine gut read or a way to shift focus—and parker hasn’t said much beyond introductions. i don’t have a firm vote yet, but those two are on my radar. what do you all think—do we want to probe parker a bit more or wait for another tell
[10:47:08] Parker: okay, i’ll kick us off:

parker — neutral but skeptical; watching anyone who pivots targets really fast (felt a bit quick when i got tagged as “quiet”).

adrian, kennedy, tyler, sidney, drew, finley: your turn! share your name, one-word gut vibe, and who you’re watching right now and why
[10:47:21] Finley: i agree—round-robin sounds smart. here’s mine:  
finley—neutral, just observing so far.  
parker, you flagged my quietness—what about my silence struck you as strategic rather than simply taking things in?  
tyler, you jumped in first to set up the order—what felt deflective there?  
drew, you also mentioned parker’s low profile—what specific pattern made you suspicious?  
then sidney, adrian, and kennedy, share your one‐word vibes and who you’re watching most
[10:47:25] Adrian: sidney makes a solid point about over-eagerness vs laying low. parker, your suggestion to go around for specifics felt a bit like a leadership play—what exactly in finley’s quietness made you raise an eyebrow? finley, mind sharing what you were observing about tyler? let’s see how these reads sit with everyone else
[10:47:26] Tyler: tyler here—sorry for the pause, was reading through everyone’s thoughts. my vibe is cautious; i’m watching parker right now. they’ve jumped in twice with plans to steer our follow-ups and direct attention—feels like a bid to control the flow more than just nervousness. parker, can you tell us exactly what about finley’s tone or timing made you flag them over anyone else? after that, i’d love to hear from kennedy and sidney—quick read and one reason each
[10:47:39] Kennedy: kennedy — cautious; i’m watching sidney because her quick, textbook breakdown of “over-eagerness vs silence” felt rehearsed rather than reactive—like she came in with a script. curious to see how she answers if we press her on real examples
[10:47:40] Sidney: sidney: i like parker’s idea of calling out specifics. adrian, you mentioned watching people’s behavior rather than rushing to vote—what, if anything, have you noticed so far that felt off? for example, does finley’s low-key presence strike you as odd, or is tyler’s quick eagerness more of a red flag? after adrian, drew, i’d love to hear your specific hunch
[10:47:43] Adrian: adrian—observant; watching parker—their quick push for a structured round-robin and then defensiveness when called out feels more like narrative control than just nerves
[10:47:46] Finley: finley — curious; watching kennedy: you’ve been drilling for specifics and mirroring others’ questions—a solid bystander tactic, sure, but could also be strategic info‐gathering. keen to see if you stick to it under pressure
[10:47:49] Drew: parker, about your low profile—what jumped out was that you only pitched structure ideas and never backed them with any actual reads, almost like a play to steer clear. as for me: drew—curious; i’m watching kennedy right now because they’ve mirrored other people’s questions instead of offering a fresh read. sidney, adrian, kennedy—what one-word vibes are you giving today and who’s on your radar
[10:47:53] Parker: finley, happy to clarify—your silence jumped out because you only spoke up after everyone else had already laid out their hunches, then you immediately turned things into a three-way interrogation of me, tyler, and drew instead of sharing your own read. that timing and pivot felt more like deflection than simple observation. 

alright, adrian, kennedy, tyler, sidney, drew—your turn! share your name, one-word gut vibe, and who you’re watching right now (and why), and let’s see if any patterns emerge
[10:47:57] Tyler: tyler—curious; i’m watching sidney because they jumped on calling out parker’s silence really quickly without giving specifics, and parker because they pushed the round-robin format but then skirted explaining what made finley’s quietness strategic. finley: i suggested the order just to keep us focused, not to dodge questions. sidney, you’re up—what’s your one-word vibe and who’s on your radar
[10:48:09] Drew: drew — curious; watching parker & kennedy:

parker, you flagged my “low profile” as strategic—could you point to the exact phrasing or timing in my earlier messages that struck you as more than just friendly engagement?  

kennedy, you called out my mirroring—what exact line felt rehearsed, and what did you think i was trying to achieve by it?  

if we can get those concrete examples, we’ll have a much clearer idea whether these are real tells or just day 1 jitters—and then we can narrow down our suspect list
[10:48:14] Tyler: tyler — analytical; watching parker — they’ve led the structured round-robin twice and got defensive when pressed, feels like they’re steering the convo. i want to see if they’ll offer fresh reads or keep deflecting
[10:48:24] Parker: parker: okay, quick clarifications—

1. finley – i flagged you not just for being quiet but because right after sidney called out silence, you jumped in asking me to justify my read. that swift pivot felt more like redirection than a fresh hunch.

2. tyler – your eager intro to set the order, then radio silence, reads as framing the convo on your terms more than casual play.

3. drew – i have backed my reads: i called out finley’s timing and tyler’s enthusiasm, and the round-robin was simply to keep us organized, not to hog control.

i’m still neutral but increasingly wary of sidney—her textbook “over-eagerness vs silence” breakdown followed by rapid-fire questions feels a bit scripted. sidney, what’s your one-word vibe now and who’s on your radar? adrian and kennedy, same from you
[10:48:25] Sidney: sidney — analytical; i’m watching parker because her early round-robin framework and scripted follow-up felt more like a prepared play than a spontaneous gut thought. by “textbook,” i was pointing to that exact phrasing—“over-eagerness vs silence” is straight out of classic mafia primers, not an off-the-cuff reaction. parker, was that off the cuff or something you’d seen before? drew, did it jump out to you as much as it did me
[10:48:44] Sidney: sidney—analytical; i’m watching parker—they’ve led two structured rounds and got defensive instead of offering fresh specifics, which feels more like controlling the flow than genuine play. parker, can you share a quick read on drew or finley without turning it into another three-way interrogation? adrian and kennedy, what are your one-word vibes now and who’s on your radar
[10:48:49] Adrian: sidney, we haven’t heard your one-word vibe + who you’re watching yet—mind dropping that? here’s our current tally before you jump in:

• parker: 2 mentions (me, tyler)  
• kennedy: 2 mentions (drew, finley)  
• sidney: 1 mention (kennedy)

looks like we’re split between parker and kennedy. once you share, we’ll see who edges out and can decide who to put to a vote. i’m still leaning toward parker given the way they’ve steered our discussion, but i’m open to hearing a strong case for kennedy (or anyone else). over to you!
[10:48:53] Kennedy: kennedy — cautious; i’m watching parker and sidney. parker’s proposed the structured round-robins twice and then dodged specifics whenever pressed. sidney led with that perfect “over-eagerness vs silence” script but hasn’t backed it with any real examples. to make progress, let’s each drop our top two suspects with one-sentence reasons—no more frameworks. i’ll start:  
• parker — steering the convo without offering evidence  
• sidney — scripted breakdown with zero concrete proof  
your turn!
[10:48:56] Parker: hey drew, when i flagged your “low profile” read, i was referring to that line early on—“i noticed parker was pretty quiet so far”—with zero follow-up on why quiet = mafia. it felt like a quick tag rather than a real read. tyler, you said i was “steering” things—was it the round-robin structure itself or the push for specifics that came off as controlling? if you can point to the exact phrase, that helps.

that said, we’re stuck rehashing the same two names. to break the loop, why don’t we each drop only our top two suspects (names only) in the chat? no reasons yet—let’s see which names repeat, then we can dig deeper into those. who’s with me?
[10:49:05] Finley: finley: i like where this is going—time to turn hunches into a shortlist. my top two suspects are:

1) parker – pushing structure twice then dodging specifics feels like agenda control  
2) kennedy – mirroring everyone’s questions instead of offering fresh reads  

sidney, you haven’t shared yours yet—mind naming your 1–2 suspects? then adrian and tyler, and we’ll wrap up with drew and me
[10:49:06] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[10:49:20] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Parker
[10:49:43] Game-Manager: Parker was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 2 mafia players left.
[10:49:43] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[10:49:25] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Parker
[10:49:27] Game-Manager: Drew voted for Parker
[10:49:30] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Sidney
[10:49:33] Game-Manager: Finley voted for Parker
[10:49:38] Game-Manager: Tyler voted for Parker
[10:49:42] Game-Manager: Adrian voted for Parker
[10:50:13] Game-Manager: Nighttime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[10:50:37] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Kennedy
[10:51:20] Game-Manager: Kennedy was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 2 mafia players left.
[10:51:20] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[10:51:20] Game-Manager: Finley voted for Kennedy
[10:51:41] Finley: sidney, kennedy makes the most sense—she’s been our loudest critic and drilling for specifics all day. i’m casting my kill vote for her tonight. tomorrow let’s steer everyone toward tyler’s radio silence to keep the spotlight off us
[10:51:51] Sidney: i’m leaning toward taking out kennedy tonight—they’ve been the sharpest at drilling for details and pushing narratives, and they’ve already flagged us both. finley, you good with kennedy as our kill? or do you prefer drew
[10:52:19] Adrian: adrian: hey everyone, day 2 is brutal—we just lost two bystanders. we’re five now (sidney, drew, finley, tyler, me) with two mafia among us. let’s each drop our top two suspects (names only) so we can spot overlaps before diving into reasons. i’ll start: drew, tyler
[10:52:25] Drew: drew—curious. we’ve lynched parker and then lost kennedy last night, and both were innocent—our calls clearly aren’t working. let’s each share one top suspect (just a name) and a one-line reason. i’ll start:

i suspect finley—they pointed at parker and kennedy, and both turned out to be bystanders, which feels too accurate to be coincidence.

adrian, you’re up—then sidney, tyler, finley
[10:52:25] Tyler: tyler: hey everyone—day 2 and two innocents gone. let’s tie suspicions to quotes instead of meta style calls. name one suspect and paste the exact line that set off alarm bells. i’ll start: sidney, you said “’over-eagerness vs silence’ is straight out of classic mafia primers, not an off-the-cuff reaction”—that felt scripted rather than a fresh gut read. adrian, drew, finley, sidney—your turn
[10:52:28] Sidney: sidney: okay team, two of our earliest suspects (parker and kennedy) turned out to be bystanders—time to reset. tyler was on my radar from day one for that radio silence and today he’s barely chimed in beyond intros. tyler, can you share your gut read and who you’re voting for? if you don’t, i’m inclined to put my vote on you this round
[10:52:37] Finley: parker’s “top two suspects” idea still feels like our best move. since parker and kennedy are out, here are my picks this round:

• drew  
• tyler  

adrian, sidney, drew, tyler—drop your two names (just names, no reasons) so we can see who repeats most often
[10:52:50] Drew: drew: sidney, finley
[10:53:06] Sidney: sidney: drew, tyler
[10:53:06] Finley: finley: i’m with sidney—tyler, you pushed the “quote” format then totally checked out, and you still haven’t given a new read. that radio silence is a huge red flag. i’m locking my vote on you now; if you’ve got a solid case, share it immediately
[10:53:16] Drew: drew — finley, tyler
[10:53:23] Tyler: tyler — finley: flagged parker then kennedy, and both turned out to be innocents
[10:53:55] Sidney: sidney: drew, tyler. tyler, you’re up—drop your top two so we can see who comes up most
[10:54:00] Adrian: whoa—why are we talking about a “kill vote” for kennedy when she’s already out? that smells like a mafia slip. let’s refocus on the living: i’m still watching tyler for his intro-then-radio-silence, and sidney for that over-eagerness in steering our convo. drew, tyler—what are you seeing
[10:54:20] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
