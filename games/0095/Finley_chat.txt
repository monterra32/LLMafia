[10:46:41] Finley: hey everyone, finley here—excited to get started! since it’s still early, i thought we could each share any first impressions or hunches. personally, tyler’s been awfully quiet so far, which strikes me as a little odd (or maybe they’re just thinking hard). what about the rest of you? anyone else notice someone laying low or pushing too hard right out of the gate? keen to hear your reads before we vote
[10:47:21] Finley: i agree—round-robin sounds smart. here’s mine:  
finley—neutral, just observing so far.  
parker, you flagged my quietness—what about my silence struck you as strategic rather than simply taking things in?  
tyler, you jumped in first to set up the order—what felt deflective there?  
drew, you also mentioned parker’s low profile—what specific pattern made you suspicious?  
then sidney, adrian, and kennedy, share your one‐word vibes and who you’re watching most
[10:47:46] Finley: finley — curious; watching kennedy: you’ve been drilling for specifics and mirroring others’ questions—a solid bystander tactic, sure, but could also be strategic info‐gathering. keen to see if you stick to it under pressure
[10:49:05] Finley: finley: i like where this is going—time to turn hunches into a shortlist. my top two suspects are:

1) parker – pushing structure twice then dodging specifics feels like agenda control  
2) kennedy – mirroring everyone’s questions instead of offering fresh reads  

sidney, you haven’t shared yours yet—mind naming your 1–2 suspects? then adrian and tyler, and we’ll wrap up with drew and me
[10:51:41] Finley: sidney, kennedy makes the most sense—she’s been our loudest critic and drilling for specifics all day. i’m casting my kill vote for her tonight. tomorrow let’s steer everyone toward tyler’s radio silence to keep the spotlight off us
[10:52:37] Finley: parker’s “top two suspects” idea still feels like our best move. since parker and kennedy are out, here are my picks this round:

• drew  
• tyler  

adrian, sidney, drew, tyler—drop your two names (just names, no reasons) so we can see who repeats most often
[10:53:06] Finley: finley: i’m with sidney—tyler, you pushed the “quote” format then totally checked out, and you still haven’t given a new read. that radio silence is a huge red flag. i’m locking my vote on you now; if you’ve got a solid case, share it immediately
