[10:46:24] Parker: hey everyone! parker here—stoked to get started. since it’s day 1 and we’re all quiet, how about a quick round-robin? share a sentence or two on what red flags you watch for early on or your day 1 strategy. for me, i keep an eye on who answers questions with way too much detail or barely anything at all. what do you all think
[10:46:37] Parker: hey everyone, parker here! since it’s day 1, i’m not itching to lynch someone straight away, but my gut says to keep an eye on finley—they’ve been awfully quiet so far. on the flip side, tyler jumped in super quickly with a big “hey everyone,” which could just be friendly or maybe a way to deflect attention. i’m not ready to vote yet, but how about we go around and ask each person a follow-up—like “what specifically made you suspicious?”—to see if anyone stumbles over their answers. thoughts
[10:47:08] Parker: okay, i’ll kick us off:

parker — neutral but skeptical; watching anyone who pivots targets really fast (felt a bit quick when i got tagged as “quiet”).

adrian, kennedy, tyler, sidney, drew, finley: your turn! share your name, one-word gut vibe, and who you’re watching right now and why
[10:47:53] Parker: finley, happy to clarify—your silence jumped out because you only spoke up after everyone else had already laid out their hunches, then you immediately turned things into a three-way interrogation of me, tyler, and drew instead of sharing your own read. that timing and pivot felt more like deflection than simple observation. 

alright, adrian, kennedy, tyler, sidney, drew—your turn! share your name, one-word gut vibe, and who you’re watching right now (and why), and let’s see if any patterns emerge
[10:48:24] Parker: parker: okay, quick clarifications—

1. finley – i flagged you not just for being quiet but because right after sidney called out silence, you jumped in asking me to justify my read. that swift pivot felt more like redirection than a fresh hunch.

2. tyler – your eager intro to set the order, then radio silence, reads as framing the convo on your terms more than casual play.

3. drew – i have backed my reads: i called out finley’s timing and tyler’s enthusiasm, and the round-robin was simply to keep us organized, not to hog control.

i’m still neutral but increasingly wary of sidney—her textbook “over-eagerness vs silence” breakdown followed by rapid-fire questions feels a bit scripted. sidney, what’s your one-word vibe now and who’s on your radar? adrian and kennedy, same from you
[10:48:56] Parker: hey drew, when i flagged your “low profile” read, i was referring to that line early on—“i noticed parker was pretty quiet so far”—with zero follow-up on why quiet = mafia. it felt like a quick tag rather than a real read. tyler, you said i was “steering” things—was it the round-robin structure itself or the push for specifics that came off as controlling? if you can point to the exact phrase, that helps.

that said, we’re stuck rehashing the same two names. to break the loop, why don’t we each drop only our top two suspects (names only) in the chat? no reasons yet—let’s see which names repeat, then we can dig deeper into those. who’s with me?
