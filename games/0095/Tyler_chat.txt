[10:46:33] Tyler: hey everyone! tyler here—excited to get started. since we’re all flying blind day 1, how about a quick round‐robin? share your name, one-word gut vibe (curious, skeptical, neutral, etc.), and one person you’re keeping an eye on (even if it’s just a guess). i’ll kick us off:

tyler—curious; watching whoever stays quiet for now. adrian, you’re up!
[10:47:06] Tyler: hey everyone, tyler here! i tend to agree with adrian that being super quiet or overly eager can both be red flags. right now sidney was quick to call out parker’s silence—could be a genuine gut read or a way to shift focus—and parker hasn’t said much beyond introductions. i don’t have a firm vote yet, but those two are on my radar. what do you all think—do we want to probe parker a bit more or wait for another tell
[10:47:26] Tyler: tyler here—sorry for the pause, was reading through everyone’s thoughts. my vibe is cautious; i’m watching parker right now. they’ve jumped in twice with plans to steer our follow-ups and direct attention—feels like a bid to control the flow more than just nervousness. parker, can you tell us exactly what about finley’s tone or timing made you flag them over anyone else? after that, i’d love to hear from kennedy and sidney—quick read and one reason each
[10:47:57] Tyler: tyler—curious; i’m watching sidney because they jumped on calling out parker’s silence really quickly without giving specifics, and parker because they pushed the round-robin format but then skirted explaining what made finley’s quietness strategic. finley: i suggested the order just to keep us focused, not to dodge questions. sidney, you’re up—what’s your one-word vibe and who’s on your radar
[10:48:14] Tyler: tyler — analytical; watching parker — they’ve led the structured round-robin twice and got defensive when pressed, feels like they’re steering the convo. i want to see if they’ll offer fresh reads or keep deflecting
[10:52:25] Tyler: tyler: hey everyone—day 2 and two innocents gone. let’s tie suspicions to quotes instead of meta style calls. name one suspect and paste the exact line that set off alarm bells. i’ll start: sidney, you said “’over-eagerness vs silence’ is straight out of classic mafia primers, not an off-the-cuff reaction”—that felt scripted rather than a fresh gut read. adrian, drew, finley, sidney—your turn
[10:53:23] Tyler: tyler — finley: flagged parker then kennedy, and both turned out to be innocents
[10:55:58] Tyler: tyler: i’m voting for finley — you flagged parker then kennedy (both innocents) and even slipped talking about a “kill vote” for kennedy after she was already out. that reads like mafia misdirection, so i’m locking in my vote
