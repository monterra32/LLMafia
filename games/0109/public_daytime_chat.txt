[20:33:05] Parker: hey sam, charlie—day 1 always feels tricky with zero info. how about a quick round where each of us names one person we find a bit fishy (no hard commitment, just to see reactions)? i’ll let you two go first—sam, any initial hunch? charlie, how about you
[20:33:08] Sam: hey parker and charlie—sam here! excited to get started. i’m a fan of letting people talk themselves into a corner before tossing out accusations. how about you two—any past mafia experiences or gut reads already? let’s hear your strategies before we dive into votes
[20:33:08] Charlie: hey everyone, charlie here! excited to get started. since it’s day 1 and we’ve got zero clues so far, i’m curious—what’s your gut feeling? anyone already striking you as a bit off? love to hear your first impressions before we dive into accusations
[20:33:20] Parker: hey everyone! i’m parker. no clear tells yet—any initial reads? i’d love to hear from sam and charlie if you’ve noticed anything odd before we start throwing votes around
[20:33:23] Sam: hey parker, good idea! my zero-info read is charlie—he’s been pretty quiet so far. no strong conviction, just a day 1 vibe. charlie, who’s on your radar
