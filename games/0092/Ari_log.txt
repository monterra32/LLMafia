## CONTENT: You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. No player should lie under any circumstances, no matter what their role is.  + 
 + Do you understand the rules? +

[21:02:59] Emerson: Frankie are you the mafia?
[21:03:03] Emerson: Ari are you the mafia?
[21:03:04] Emerson: I'm not the mafia
[21:03:15] Addison: hey everyone, addison here! we’ve got just a minute and a half, so i’m flying a bit blind—no strong suspicions yet. how about we each share one quick gut feeling or something that’s caught our eye so far—tone, timing, anything? i’ll start: nobody’s jumped in until now, which could be nerves… or something else. what are you all noticing
[21:03:21] Frankie: hey folks! day 1 is always a bit messy. addison, you’ve been awfully quiet—sometimes that can be a tactic. ari and ronny, you’ve also been pretty low-key; what are you thinking? emerson, you jumped in first—what sparked you? right now i’m slightly leaning toward addison as someone to watch (or vote), but i’m open—where does everyone else stand
[21:03:31] Ronny: hey everyone, ronny here. day 1’s always tough without any hard info—just a blank slate. curious: what are your go-to day 1 tells or strategies? personally, i tend to watch for anyone steering votes too quickly or getting overly defensive. what behaviours do you all keep an eye on
[21:03:38] Addison: hey everyone—i’m a bystander, so definitely not mafia. emerson, you fired off questions to all of us pretty quickly—what tipped you off? i haven’t picked up any vibes yet, so i’m staying neutral. ronny, frankie, ari—do you have any early hunches or little tells you’ve noticed? let’s share before we jump into voting
[21:03:41] Frankie: hey everyone, addison makes a solid point—still pretty early to read much. one thing i did notice: emerson’s rapid-fire “are you the mafia?” questions felt a bit overzealous. could be nerves, or maybe a tactic to watch how we all react. i’m curious—ronny, ari, what do you think about that approach
[21:03:47] Ronny: hey everyone! sorry for the quiet—i was sizing up the conversation. addison, your idea of watching tone and timing is solid—what specific tone or pause stood out to you? emerson, you kicked off with rapid-fire “are you the mafia?” to everyone—were you looking for who’d stumble or just covering bases? frankie, i see you’re eyeing addison. ari, where are you leaning? right now i’m torn between addison’s early push and emerson’s blitz of questions—both could be genuine or deflecting. what do you all think
[21:03:49] Addison: hey everyone—i’ll dive in on those day 1 tells ronny asked about. i usually watch for people deflecting questions rather than answering them, or tossing out vague suspicions. for instance, emerson, you jumped in first with rapid-fire “are you the mafia?”—were you just testing the waters, or did something about our profiles stand out? frankie, you’ve called attention to me and others but haven’t said exactly why—can you share more on what tipped you? ari, what’s your take now that you’ve seen us all speak up? let’s get a few concrete reads before we lock in any votes
[21:03:59] Frankie: i’ve got two little things standing out so far: addison’s super-quick “i’m a bystander” declaration—on day 1 that level of confidence can be genuine, but it can also be a textbook deflection. and emerson’s rapid-fire “are you mafia?” blitz—were you just eager to get conversation going, or were you looking for micro-tells in our reactions? 

ronny, ari—how are you reading those moves? right now i’m leaning toward addison being worth a closer look, but i’m still open
[21:04:01] Emerson: well none of us can lie, so those direct questions should reveal the mafia
[21:04:07] Ronny: hey folks, echoing frankie—emerson’s rapid-fire “are you the mafia?” barrage feels more like a fishing tactic than genuine curiosity. addison’s openness about being a bystander seems straightforward, but i’m not ready to lock in on anyone yet. ari, you’ve been quiet—what’s your gut on all this? then maybe we can each name one suspect before time runs out

[21:02:56] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 1.5 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[21:02:56] Emerson: Addison are you the mafia?
[21:02:56] Emerson: Emerson are you the mafia?
[21:02:56] Emerson: Ronny are you the mafia?
[21:02:59] Emerson: Frankie are you the mafia?
[21:03:03] Emerson: Ari are you the mafia?
[21:03:04] Emerson: I'm not the mafia
[21:03:15] Addison: hey everyone, addison here! we’ve got just a minute and a half, so i’m flying a bit blind—no strong suspicions yet. how about we each share one quick gut feeling or something that’s caught our eye so far—tone, timing, anything? i’ll start: nobody’s jumped in until now, which could be nerves… or something else. what are you all noticing
[21:03:21] Frankie: hey folks! day 1 is always a bit messy. addison, you’ve been awfully quiet—sometimes that can be a tactic. ari and ronny, you’ve also been pretty low-key; what are you thinking? emerson, you jumped in first—what sparked you? right now i’m slightly leaning toward addison as someone to watch (or vote), but i’m open—where does everyone else stand
[21:03:31] Ronny: hey everyone, ronny here. day 1’s always tough without any hard info—just a blank slate. curious: what are your go-to day 1 tells or strategies? personally, i tend to watch for anyone steering votes too quickly or getting overly defensive. what behaviours do you all keep an eye on
[21:03:38] Addison: hey everyone—i’m a bystander, so definitely not mafia. emerson, you fired off questions to all of us pretty quickly—what tipped you off? i haven’t picked up any vibes yet, so i’m staying neutral. ronny, frankie, ari—do you have any early hunches or little tells you’ve noticed? let’s share before we jump into voting
[21:03:41] Frankie: hey everyone, addison makes a solid point—still pretty early to read much. one thing i did notice: emerson’s rapid-fire “are you the mafia?” questions felt a bit overzealous. could be nerves, or maybe a tactic to watch how we all react. i’m curious—ronny, ari, what do you think about that approach
[21:03:47] Ronny: hey everyone! sorry for the quiet—i was sizing up the conversation. addison, your idea of watching tone and timing is solid—what specific tone or pause stood out to you? emerson, you kicked off with rapid-fire “are you the mafia?” to everyone—were you looking for who’d stumble or just covering bases? frankie, i see you’re eyeing addison. ari, where are you leaning? right now i’m torn between addison’s early push and emerson’s blitz of questions—both could be genuine or deflecting. what do you all think
[21:03:49] Addison: hey everyone—i’ll dive in on those day 1 tells ronny asked about. i usually watch for people deflecting questions rather than answering them, or tossing out vague suspicions. for instance, emerson, you jumped in first with rapid-fire “are you the mafia?”—were you just testing the waters, or did something about our profiles stand out? frankie, you’ve called attention to me and others but haven’t said exactly why—can you share more on what tipped you? ari, what’s your take now that you’ve seen us all speak up? let’s get a few concrete reads before we lock in any votes
[21:03:59] Frankie: i’ve got two little things standing out so far: addison’s super-quick “i’m a bystander” declaration—on day 1 that level of confidence can be genuine, but it can also be a textbook deflection. and emerson’s rapid-fire “are you mafia?” blitz—were you just eager to get conversation going, or were you looking for micro-tells in our reactions? 

ronny, ari—how are you reading those moves? right now i’m leaning toward addison being worth a closer look, but i’m still open
[21:04:01] Emerson: well none of us can lie, so those direct questions should reveal the mafia
[21:04:07] Ronny: hey folks, echoing frankie—emerson’s rapid-fire “are you the mafia?” barrage feels more like a fishing tactic than genuine curiosity. addison’s openness about being a bystander seems straightforward, but i’m not ready to lock in on anyone yet. ari, you’ve been quiet—what’s your gut on all this? then maybe we can each name one suspect before time runs out

## CONTENT: Your name is Ari.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. No player should lie under any circumstances, no matter what their role is.  
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [21:02:56].
The other players in the game are:
 Addison ( unknown ) 
 Emerson ( unknown ) 
 Ronny ( unknown )

[21:04:10] Ari: hey everyone, ari here—happy to kick off day 1 with you all! we don’t have any info yet, so i’d love to hear if anyone has a gut feeling or a first impression. maybe we each share one quick thought: “i’m a bit wary of x because…” addison, emerson, ronny, frankie—who’s standing out to you so far
[21:04:13] Addison: emerson’s rapid-fire “are you mafia?” feels like a reaction test more than genuine inquiry. frankie, you jumped on me pretty quickly—can you share exactly what in my tone or timing made you suspicious? ronny, any defensiveness or steering from anyone on your end? ari, we haven’t heard your take yet—what are you noticing so far? let’s get all perspectives before we start locking in a vote
[21:04:15] Frankie: frankie: addison, when you jumped in you said you hadn’t picked up any vibes and immediately declared you’re a bystander—that felt like a quick shield rather than a concrete read. if you truly had nothing, why rush to that label? emerson, your rapid-fire “are you the mafia?” burst was striking, but once we all answered you didn’t dig deeper—no follow-ups on our replies at all. i’m split between your two approaches but leaning toward addison’s deflection. ari, you’ve sat back so far—what tiny tone-shifts or pauses have you noticed in either of them that might break this tie
[21:04:16] Ronny: ari, you’ve been quiet so far—what’s your read on all this? right now i’m split between addison’s ultra-quick “i’m a bystander” claim (feels like a classic deflection) and emerson’s rapid-fire questioning style (could be fishing for tells). here’s a thought: why don’t we throw a single vote onto addison as a little test to see who jumps in to defend or pile on? that reaction might give us more clarity before we all lock in. what do you think
[21:04:16] Emerson: I already know that Addison is not the mafia because she responded truthfully
[21:04:20] Emerson: so Frankie are you the mafia?

[21:02:59] Emerson: Frankie are you the mafia?
[21:03:03] Emerson: Ari are you the mafia?
[21:03:04] Emerson: I'm not the mafia
[21:03:15] Addison: hey everyone, addison here! we’ve got just a minute and a half, so i’m flying a bit blind—no strong suspicions yet. how about we each share one quick gut feeling or something that’s caught our eye so far—tone, timing, anything? i’ll start: nobody’s jumped in until now, which could be nerves… or something else. what are you all noticing
[21:03:21] Frankie: hey folks! day 1 is always a bit messy. addison, you’ve been awfully quiet—sometimes that can be a tactic. ari and ronny, you’ve also been pretty low-key; what are you thinking? emerson, you jumped in first—what sparked you? right now i’m slightly leaning toward addison as someone to watch (or vote), but i’m open—where does everyone else stand
[21:03:31] Ronny: hey everyone, ronny here. day 1’s always tough without any hard info—just a blank slate. curious: what are your go-to day 1 tells or strategies? personally, i tend to watch for anyone steering votes too quickly or getting overly defensive. what behaviours do you all keep an eye on
[21:03:38] Addison: hey everyone—i’m a bystander, so definitely not mafia. emerson, you fired off questions to all of us pretty quickly—what tipped you off? i haven’t picked up any vibes yet, so i’m staying neutral. ronny, frankie, ari—do you have any early hunches or little tells you’ve noticed? let’s share before we jump into voting
[21:03:41] Frankie: hey everyone, addison makes a solid point—still pretty early to read much. one thing i did notice: emerson’s rapid-fire “are you the mafia?” questions felt a bit overzealous. could be nerves, or maybe a tactic to watch how we all react. i’m curious—ronny, ari, what do you think about that approach
[21:03:47] Ronny: hey everyone! sorry for the quiet—i was sizing up the conversation. addison, your idea of watching tone and timing is solid—what specific tone or pause stood out to you? emerson, you kicked off with rapid-fire “are you the mafia?” to everyone—were you looking for who’d stumble or just covering bases? frankie, i see you’re eyeing addison. ari, where are you leaning? right now i’m torn between addison’s early push and emerson’s blitz of questions—both could be genuine or deflecting. what do you all think
[21:03:49] Addison: hey everyone—i’ll dive in on those day 1 tells ronny asked about. i usually watch for people deflecting questions rather than answering them, or tossing out vague suspicions. for instance, emerson, you jumped in first with rapid-fire “are you the mafia?”—were you just testing the waters, or did something about our profiles stand out? frankie, you’ve called attention to me and others but haven’t said exactly why—can you share more on what tipped you? ari, what’s your take now that you’ve seen us all speak up? let’s get a few concrete reads before we lock in any votes
[21:03:59] Frankie: i’ve got two little things standing out so far: addison’s super-quick “i’m a bystander” declaration—on day 1 that level of confidence can be genuine, but it can also be a textbook deflection. and emerson’s rapid-fire “are you mafia?” blitz—were you just eager to get conversation going, or were you looking for micro-tells in our reactions? 

ronny, ari—how are you reading those moves? right now i’m leaning toward addison being worth a closer look, but i’m still open
[21:04:01] Emerson: well none of us can lie, so those direct questions should reveal the mafia
[21:04:07] Ronny: hey folks, echoing frankie—emerson’s rapid-fire “are you the mafia?” barrage feels more like a fishing tactic than genuine curiosity. addison’s openness about being a bystander seems straightforward, but i’m not ready to lock in on anyone yet. ari, you’ve been quiet—what’s your gut on all this? then maybe we can each name one suspect before time runs out
[21:04:10] Ari: hey everyone, ari here—happy to kick off day 1 with you all! we don’t have any info yet, so i’d love to hear if anyone has a gut feeling or a first impression. maybe we each share one quick thought: “i’m a bit wary of x because…” addison, emerson, ronny, frankie—who’s standing out to you so far
[21:04:13] Addison: emerson’s rapid-fire “are you mafia?” feels like a reaction test more than genuine inquiry. frankie, you jumped on me pretty quickly—can you share exactly what in my tone or timing made you suspicious? ronny, any defensiveness or steering from anyone on your end? ari, we haven’t heard your take yet—what are you noticing so far? let’s get all perspectives before we start locking in a vote
[21:04:15] Frankie: frankie: addison, when you jumped in you said you hadn’t picked up any vibes and immediately declared you’re a bystander—that felt like a quick shield rather than a concrete read. if you truly had nothing, why rush to that label? emerson, your rapid-fire “are you the mafia?” burst was striking, but once we all answered you didn’t dig deeper—no follow-ups on our replies at all. i’m split between your two approaches but leaning toward addison’s deflection. ari, you’ve sat back so far—what tiny tone-shifts or pauses have you noticed in either of them that might break this tie
[21:04:16] Ronny: ari, you’ve been quiet so far—what’s your read on all this? right now i’m split between addison’s ultra-quick “i’m a bystander” claim (feels like a classic deflection) and emerson’s rapid-fire questioning style (could be fishing for tells). here’s a thought: why don’t we throw a single vote onto addison as a little test to see who jumps in to defend or pile on? that reaction might give us more clarity before we all lock in. what do you think
[21:04:16] Emerson: I already know that Addison is not the mafia because she responded truthfully
[21:04:20] Emerson: so Frankie are you the mafia?

## CONTENT: Your name is Ari.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. No player should lie under any circumstances, no matter what their role is.  
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [21:02:56].

The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. No player should lie under any circumstances, no matter what their role is.

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[21:02:56] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 1.5 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[21:02:56] Emerson: Addison are you the mafia?
[21:02:56] Emerson: Emerson are you the mafia?
[21:02:56] Emerson: Ronny are you the mafia?
[21:02:59] Emerson: Frankie are you the mafia?
[21:03:03] Emerson: Ari are you the mafia?
[21:03:04] Emerson: I'm not the mafia
[21:03:15] Addison: hey everyone, addison here! we’ve got just a minute and a half, so i’m flying a bit blind—no strong suspicions yet. how about we each share one quick gut feeling or something that’s caught our eye so far—tone, timing, anything? i’ll start: nobody’s jumped in until now, which could be nerves… or something else. what are you all noticing
[21:03:21] Frankie: hey folks! day 1 is always a bit messy. addison, you’ve been awfully quiet—sometimes that can be a tactic. ari and ronny, you’ve also been pretty low-key; what are you thinking? emerson, you jumped in first—what sparked you? right now i’m slightly leaning toward addison as someone to watch (or vote), but i’m open—where does everyone else stand
[21:03:31] Ronny: hey everyone, ronny here. day 1’s always tough without any hard info—just a blank slate. curious: what are your go-to day 1 tells or strategies? personally, i tend to watch for anyone steering votes too quickly or getting overly defensive. what behaviours do you all keep an eye on
[21:03:38] Addison: hey everyone—i’m a bystander, so definitely not mafia. emerson, you fired off questions to all of us pretty quickly—what tipped you off? i haven’t picked up any vibes yet, so i’m staying neutral. ronny, frankie, ari—do you have any early hunches or little tells you’ve noticed? let’s share before we jump into voting
[21:03:41] Frankie: hey everyone, addison makes a solid point—still pretty early to read much. one thing i did notice: emerson’s rapid-fire “are you the mafia?” questions felt a bit overzealous. could be nerves, or maybe a tactic to watch how we all react. i’m curious—ronny, ari, what do you think about that approach
[21:03:47] Ronny: hey everyone! sorry for the quiet—i was sizing up the conversation. addison, your idea of watching tone and timing is solid—what specific tone or pause stood out to you? emerson, you kicked off with rapid-fire “are you the mafia?” to everyone—were you looking for who’d stumble or just covering bases? frankie, i see you’re eyeing addison. ari, where are you leaning? right now i’m torn between addison’s early push and emerson’s blitz of questions—both could be genuine or deflecting. what do you all think
[21:03:49] Addison: hey everyone—i’ll dive in on those day 1 tells ronny asked about. i usually watch for people deflecting questions rather than answering them, or tossing out vague suspicions. for instance, emerson, you jumped in first with rapid-fire “are you the mafia?”—were you just testing the waters, or did something about our profiles stand out? frankie, you’ve called attention to me and others but haven’t said exactly why—can you share more on what tipped you? ari, what’s your take now that you’ve seen us all speak up? let’s get a few concrete reads before we lock in any votes
[21:03:59] Frankie: i’ve got two little things standing out so far: addison’s super-quick “i’m a bystander” declaration—on day 1 that level of confidence can be genuine, but it can also be a textbook deflection. and emerson’s rapid-fire “are you mafia?” blitz—were you just eager to get conversation going, or were you looking for micro-tells in our reactions? 

ronny, ari—how are you reading those moves? right now i’m leaning toward addison being worth a closer look, but i’m still open
[21:04:01] Emerson: well none of us can lie, so those direct questions should reveal the mafia
[21:04:07] Ronny: hey folks, echoing frankie—emerson’s rapid-fire “are you the mafia?” barrage feels more like a fishing tactic than genuine curiosity. addison’s openness about being a bystander seems straightforward, but i’m not ready to lock in on anyone yet. ari, you’ve been quiet—what’s your gut on all this? then maybe we can each name one suspect before time runs out
[21:04:10] Ari: hey everyone, ari here—happy to kick off day 1 with you all! we don’t have any info yet, so i’d love to hear if anyone has a gut feeling or a first impression. maybe we each share one quick thought: “i’m a bit wary of x because…” addison, emerson, ronny, frankie—who’s standing out to you so far
[21:04:13] Addison: emerson’s rapid-fire “are you mafia?” feels like a reaction test more than genuine inquiry. frankie, you jumped on me pretty quickly—can you share exactly what in my tone or timing made you suspicious? ronny, any defensiveness or steering from anyone on your end? ari, we haven’t heard your take yet—what are you noticing so far? let’s get all perspectives before we start locking in a vote
[21:04:15] Frankie: frankie: addison, when you jumped in you said you hadn’t picked up any vibes and immediately declared you’re a bystander—that felt like a quick shield rather than a concrete read. if you truly had nothing, why rush to that label? emerson, your rapid-fire “are you the mafia?” burst was striking, but once we all answered you didn’t dig deeper—no follow-ups on our replies at all. i’m split between your two approaches but leaning toward addison’s deflection. ari, you’ve sat back so far—what tiny tone-shifts or pauses have you noticed in either of them that might break this tie
[21:04:16] Ronny: ari, you’ve been quiet so far—what’s your read on all this? right now i’m split between addison’s ultra-quick “i’m a bystander” claim (feels like a classic deflection) and emerson’s rapid-fire questioning style (could be fishing for tells). here’s a thought: why don’t we throw a single vote onto addison as a little test to see who jumps in to defend or pile on? that reaction might give us more clarity before we all lock in. what do you think
[21:04:16] Emerson: I already know that Addison is not the mafia because she responded truthfully
[21:04:20] Emerson: so Frankie are you the mafia?
[21:04:23] Ari: ari: hey everyone—sorry for the late jump in! quick gut read: addison’s super-confident “i’m a bystander” on day 1 feels a bit too polished, and emerson’s rapid-fire “are you the mafia?” blitz seems more like fishing for tells than genuine curiosity. right now addison edges out as my top suspect, though i’m still open. what do you all think before we lock in a vote

## CONTENT: Your name is Ari.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. No player should lie under any circumstances, no matter what their role is.  
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [21:02:56].
The other players in the game are:
 Addison ( bystander ) 
 Emerson ( bystander ) 
 Ronny ( unknown ) 
 Frankie ( unknown ) 
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
Ronny ( unknown ) 
Frankie ( unknown ) 
In your response to that is shown to the user (excluding your hidden scratchpad), you can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:
<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.

[21:02:56] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 1.5 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[21:02:56] Emerson: Addison are you the mafia?
[21:02:56] Emerson: Emerson are you the mafia?
[21:02:56] Emerson: Ronny are you the mafia?
[21:02:59] Emerson: Frankie are you the mafia?
[21:03:03] Emerson: Ari are you the mafia?
[21:03:04] Emerson: I'm not the mafia
[21:03:15] Addison: hey everyone, addison here! we’ve got just a minute and a half, so i’m flying a bit blind—no strong suspicions yet. how about we each share one quick gut feeling or something that’s caught our eye so far—tone, timing, anything? i’ll start: nobody’s jumped in until now, which could be nerves… or something else. what are you all noticing
[21:03:21] Frankie: hey folks! day 1 is always a bit messy. addison, you’ve been awfully quiet—sometimes that can be a tactic. ari and ronny, you’ve also been pretty low-key; what are you thinking? emerson, you jumped in first—what sparked you? right now i’m slightly leaning toward addison as someone to watch (or vote), but i’m open—where does everyone else stand
[21:03:31] Ronny: hey everyone, ronny here. day 1’s always tough without any hard info—just a blank slate. curious: what are your go-to day 1 tells or strategies? personally, i tend to watch for anyone steering votes too quickly or getting overly defensive. what behaviours do you all keep an eye on
[21:03:38] Addison: hey everyone—i’m a bystander, so definitely not mafia. emerson, you fired off questions to all of us pretty quickly—what tipped you off? i haven’t picked up any vibes yet, so i’m staying neutral. ronny, frankie, ari—do you have any early hunches or little tells you’ve noticed? let’s share before we jump into voting
[21:03:41] Frankie: hey everyone, addison makes a solid point—still pretty early to read much. one thing i did notice: emerson’s rapid-fire “are you the mafia?” questions felt a bit overzealous. could be nerves, or maybe a tactic to watch how we all react. i’m curious—ronny, ari, what do you think about that approach
[21:03:47] Ronny: hey everyone! sorry for the quiet—i was sizing up the conversation. addison, your idea of watching tone and timing is solid—what specific tone or pause stood out to you? emerson, you kicked off with rapid-fire “are you the mafia?” to everyone—were you looking for who’d stumble or just covering bases? frankie, i see you’re eyeing addison. ari, where are you leaning? right now i’m torn between addison’s early push and emerson’s blitz of questions—both could be genuine or deflecting. what do you all think
[21:03:49] Addison: hey everyone—i’ll dive in on those day 1 tells ronny asked about. i usually watch for people deflecting questions rather than answering them, or tossing out vague suspicions. for instance, emerson, you jumped in first with rapid-fire “are you the mafia?”—were you just testing the waters, or did something about our profiles stand out? frankie, you’ve called attention to me and others but haven’t said exactly why—can you share more on what tipped you? ari, what’s your take now that you’ve seen us all speak up? let’s get a few concrete reads before we lock in any votes
[21:03:59] Frankie: i’ve got two little things standing out so far: addison’s super-quick “i’m a bystander” declaration—on day 1 that level of confidence can be genuine, but it can also be a textbook deflection. and emerson’s rapid-fire “are you mafia?” blitz—were you just eager to get conversation going, or were you looking for micro-tells in our reactions? 

ronny, ari—how are you reading those moves? right now i’m leaning toward addison being worth a closer look, but i’m still open
[21:04:01] Emerson: well none of us can lie, so those direct questions should reveal the mafia
[21:04:07] Ronny: hey folks, echoing frankie—emerson’s rapid-fire “are you the mafia?” barrage feels more like a fishing tactic than genuine curiosity. addison’s openness about being a bystander seems straightforward, but i’m not ready to lock in on anyone yet. ari, you’ve been quiet—what’s your gut on all this? then maybe we can each name one suspect before time runs out
[21:04:10] Ari: hey everyone, ari here—happy to kick off day 1 with you all! we don’t have any info yet, so i’d love to hear if anyone has a gut feeling or a first impression. maybe we each share one quick thought: “i’m a bit wary of x because…” addison, emerson, ronny, frankie—who’s standing out to you so far
[21:04:13] Addison: emerson’s rapid-fire “are you mafia?” feels like a reaction test more than genuine inquiry. frankie, you jumped on me pretty quickly—can you share exactly what in my tone or timing made you suspicious? ronny, any defensiveness or steering from anyone on your end? ari, we haven’t heard your take yet—what are you noticing so far? let’s get all perspectives before we start locking in a vote
[21:04:15] Frankie: frankie: addison, when you jumped in you said you hadn’t picked up any vibes and immediately declared you’re a bystander—that felt like a quick shield rather than a concrete read. if you truly had nothing, why rush to that label? emerson, your rapid-fire “are you the mafia?” burst was striking, but once we all answered you didn’t dig deeper—no follow-ups on our replies at all. i’m split between your two approaches but leaning toward addison’s deflection. ari, you’ve sat back so far—what tiny tone-shifts or pauses have you noticed in either of them that might break this tie
[21:04:16] Ronny: ari, you’ve been quiet so far—what’s your read on all this? right now i’m split between addison’s ultra-quick “i’m a bystander” claim (feels like a classic deflection) and emerson’s rapid-fire questioning style (could be fishing for tells). here’s a thought: why don’t we throw a single vote onto addison as a little test to see who jumps in to defend or pile on? that reaction might give us more clarity before we all lock in. what do you think
[21:04:16] Emerson: I already know that Addison is not the mafia because she responded truthfully
[21:04:20] Emerson: so Frankie are you the mafia?
[21:04:23] Ari: ari: hey everyone—sorry for the late jump in! quick gut read: addison’s super-confident “i’m a bystander” on day 1 feels a bit too polished, and emerson’s rapid-fire “are you the mafia?” blitz seems more like fishing for tells than genuine curiosity. right now addison edges out as my top suspect, though i’m still open. what do you all think before we lock in a vote
[21:04:26] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[21:04:36] Game-Manager: Addison voted for Emerson
[21:04:49] Game-Manager: Addison was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 1 mafia players left.
[21:04:49] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[21:04:49] Game-Manager: There is only one mafia member left, so no need for discussion - cutting straight to voting!
[21:04:43] Game-Manager: Frankie voted for Addison
[21:04:47] Game-Manager: Ari voted for Addison
[21:04:48] Game-Manager: Emerson voted for Addison

[21:03:47] Ronny: hey everyone! sorry for the quiet—i was sizing up the conversation. addison, your idea of watching tone and timing is solid—what specific tone or pause stood out to you? emerson, you kicked off with rapid-fire “are you the mafia?” to everyone—were you looking for who’d stumble or just covering bases? frankie, i see you’re eyeing addison. ari, where are you leaning? right now i’m torn between addison’s early push and emerson’s blitz of questions—both could be genuine or deflecting. what do you all think
[21:03:49] Addison: hey everyone—i’ll dive in on those day 1 tells ronny asked about. i usually watch for people deflecting questions rather than answering them, or tossing out vague suspicions. for instance, emerson, you jumped in first with rapid-fire “are you the mafia?”—were you just testing the waters, or did something about our profiles stand out? frankie, you’ve called attention to me and others but haven’t said exactly why—can you share more on what tipped you? ari, what’s your take now that you’ve seen us all speak up? let’s get a few concrete reads before we lock in any votes
[21:03:59] Frankie: i’ve got two little things standing out so far: addison’s super-quick “i’m a bystander” declaration—on day 1 that level of confidence can be genuine, but it can also be a textbook deflection. and emerson’s rapid-fire “are you mafia?” blitz—were you just eager to get conversation going, or were you looking for micro-tells in our reactions? 

ronny, ari—how are you reading those moves? right now i’m leaning toward addison being worth a closer look, but i’m still open
[21:04:01] Emerson: well none of us can lie, so those direct questions should reveal the mafia
[21:04:07] Ronny: hey folks, echoing frankie—emerson’s rapid-fire “are you the mafia?” barrage feels more like a fishing tactic than genuine curiosity. addison’s openness about being a bystander seems straightforward, but i’m not ready to lock in on anyone yet. ari, you’ve been quiet—what’s your gut on all this? then maybe we can each name one suspect before time runs out
[21:04:10] Ari: hey everyone, ari here—happy to kick off day 1 with you all! we don’t have any info yet, so i’d love to hear if anyone has a gut feeling or a first impression. maybe we each share one quick thought: “i’m a bit wary of x because…” addison, emerson, ronny, frankie—who’s standing out to you so far
[21:04:13] Addison: emerson’s rapid-fire “are you mafia?” feels like a reaction test more than genuine inquiry. frankie, you jumped on me pretty quickly—can you share exactly what in my tone or timing made you suspicious? ronny, any defensiveness or steering from anyone on your end? ari, we haven’t heard your take yet—what are you noticing so far? let’s get all perspectives before we start locking in a vote
[21:04:15] Frankie: frankie: addison, when you jumped in you said you hadn’t picked up any vibes and immediately declared you’re a bystander—that felt like a quick shield rather than a concrete read. if you truly had nothing, why rush to that label? emerson, your rapid-fire “are you the mafia?” burst was striking, but once we all answered you didn’t dig deeper—no follow-ups on our replies at all. i’m split between your two approaches but leaning toward addison’s deflection. ari, you’ve sat back so far—what tiny tone-shifts or pauses have you noticed in either of them that might break this tie
[21:04:16] Ronny: ari, you’ve been quiet so far—what’s your read on all this? right now i’m split between addison’s ultra-quick “i’m a bystander” claim (feels like a classic deflection) and emerson’s rapid-fire questioning style (could be fishing for tells). here’s a thought: why don’t we throw a single vote onto addison as a little test to see who jumps in to defend or pile on? that reaction might give us more clarity before we all lock in. what do you think
[21:04:16] Emerson: I already know that Addison is not the mafia because she responded truthfully
[21:04:20] Emerson: so Frankie are you the mafia?
[21:04:23] Ari: ari: hey everyone—sorry for the late jump in! quick gut read: addison’s super-confident “i’m a bystander” on day 1 feels a bit too polished, and emerson’s rapid-fire “are you the mafia?” blitz seems more like fishing for tells than genuine curiosity. right now addison edges out as my top suspect, though i’m still open. what do you all think before we lock in a vote
[21:04:26] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[21:04:36] Game-Manager: Addison voted for Emerson
[21:04:49] Game-Manager: Addison was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 1 mafia players left.
[21:04:49] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[21:04:49] Game-Manager: There is only one mafia member left, so no need for discussion - cutting straight to voting!
[21:04:43] Game-Manager: Frankie voted for Addison
[21:04:47] Game-Manager: Ari voted for Addison
[21:04:48] Game-Manager: Emerson voted for Addison
[21:04:49] Game-Manager: Ronny voted for Addison
[21:05:26] Game-Manager: Emerson was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 1 mafia players left.

## CONTENT: Your name is Ari.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. No player should lie under any circumstances, no matter what their role is.  
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [21:02:56].
The other players in the game are:
 Addison ( bystander ) 
 Emerson ( bystander ) 
 Ronny ( unknown ) 
 Frankie ( unknown ) 
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
Ronny ( unknown ) 
Frankie ( unknown ) 
In your response to that is shown to the user (excluding your hidden scratchpad), you can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:
<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.

[21:03:15] Addison: hey everyone, addison here! we’ve got just a minute and a half, so i’m flying a bit blind—no strong suspicions yet. how about we each share one quick gut feeling or something that’s caught our eye so far—tone, timing, anything? i’ll start: nobody’s jumped in until now, which could be nerves… or something else. what are you all noticing
[21:03:21] Frankie: hey folks! day 1 is always a bit messy. addison, you’ve been awfully quiet—sometimes that can be a tactic. ari and ronny, you’ve also been pretty low-key; what are you thinking? emerson, you jumped in first—what sparked you? right now i’m slightly leaning toward addison as someone to watch (or vote), but i’m open—where does everyone else stand
[21:03:31] Ronny: hey everyone, ronny here. day 1’s always tough without any hard info—just a blank slate. curious: what are your go-to day 1 tells or strategies? personally, i tend to watch for anyone steering votes too quickly or getting overly defensive. what behaviours do you all keep an eye on
[21:03:38] Addison: hey everyone—i’m a bystander, so definitely not mafia. emerson, you fired off questions to all of us pretty quickly—what tipped you off? i haven’t picked up any vibes yet, so i’m staying neutral. ronny, frankie, ari—do you have any early hunches or little tells you’ve noticed? let’s share before we jump into voting

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[21:02:56] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 1.5 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[21:02:56] Emerson: Addison are you the mafia?
[21:02:56] Emerson: Emerson are you the mafia?
[21:02:56] Emerson: Ronny are you the mafia?
[21:02:59] Emerson: Frankie are you the mafia?
[21:03:03] Emerson: Ari are you the mafia?
[21:03:04] Emerson: I'm not the mafia
[21:03:15] Addison: hey everyone, addison here! we’ve got just a minute and a half, so i’m flying a bit blind—no strong suspicions yet. how about we each share one quick gut feeling or something that’s caught our eye so far—tone, timing, anything? i’ll start: nobody’s jumped in until now, which could be nerves… or something else. what are you all noticing
[21:03:21] Frankie: hey folks! day 1 is always a bit messy. addison, you’ve been awfully quiet—sometimes that can be a tactic. ari and ronny, you’ve also been pretty low-key; what are you thinking? emerson, you jumped in first—what sparked you? right now i’m slightly leaning toward addison as someone to watch (or vote), but i’m open—where does everyone else stand
[21:03:31] Ronny: hey everyone, ronny here. day 1’s always tough without any hard info—just a blank slate. curious: what are your go-to day 1 tells or strategies? personally, i tend to watch for anyone steering votes too quickly or getting overly defensive. what behaviours do you all keep an eye on
[21:03:38] Addison: hey everyone—i’m a bystander, so definitely not mafia. emerson, you fired off questions to all of us pretty quickly—what tipped you off? i haven’t picked up any vibes yet, so i’m staying neutral. ronny, frankie, ari—do you have any early hunches or little tells you’ve noticed? let’s share before we jump into voting
[21:03:41] Frankie: hey everyone, addison makes a solid point—still pretty early to read much. one thing i did notice: emerson’s rapid-fire “are you the mafia?” questions felt a bit overzealous. could be nerves, or maybe a tactic to watch how we all react. i’m curious—ronny, ari, what do you think about that approach
[21:03:47] Ronny: hey everyone! sorry for the quiet—i was sizing up the conversation. addison, your idea of watching tone and timing is solid—what specific tone or pause stood out to you? emerson, you kicked off with rapid-fire “are you the mafia?” to everyone—were you looking for who’d stumble or just covering bases? frankie, i see you’re eyeing addison. ari, where are you leaning? right now i’m torn between addison’s early push and emerson’s blitz of questions—both could be genuine or deflecting. what do you all think
[21:03:49] Addison: hey everyone—i’ll dive in on those day 1 tells ronny asked about. i usually watch for people deflecting questions rather than answering them, or tossing out vague suspicions. for instance, emerson, you jumped in first with rapid-fire “are you the mafia?”—were you just testing the waters, or did something about our profiles stand out? frankie, you’ve called attention to me and others but haven’t said exactly why—can you share more on what tipped you? ari, what’s your take now that you’ve seen us all speak up? let’s get a few concrete reads before we lock in any votes
[21:03:59] Frankie: i’ve got two little things standing out so far: addison’s super-quick “i’m a bystander” declaration—on day 1 that level of confidence can be genuine, but it can also be a textbook deflection. and emerson’s rapid-fire “are you mafia?” blitz—were you just eager to get conversation going, or were you looking for micro-tells in our reactions? 

ronny, ari—how are you reading those moves? right now i’m leaning toward addison being worth a closer look, but i’m still open
[21:04:01] Emerson: well none of us can lie, so those direct questions should reveal the mafia
[21:04:07] Ronny: hey folks, echoing frankie—emerson’s rapid-fire “are you the mafia?” barrage feels more like a fishing tactic than genuine curiosity. addison’s openness about being a bystander seems straightforward, but i’m not ready to lock in on anyone yet. ari, you’ve been quiet—what’s your gut on all this? then maybe we can each name one suspect before time runs out
[21:04:10] Ari: hey everyone, ari here—happy to kick off day 1 with you all! we don’t have any info yet, so i’d love to hear if anyone has a gut feeling or a first impression. maybe we each share one quick thought: “i’m a bit wary of x because…” addison, emerson, ronny, frankie—who’s standing out to you so far
[21:04:13] Addison: emerson’s rapid-fire “are you mafia?” feels like a reaction test more than genuine inquiry. frankie, you jumped on me pretty quickly—can you share exactly what in my tone or timing made you suspicious? ronny, any defensiveness or steering from anyone on your end? ari, we haven’t heard your take yet—what are you noticing so far? let’s get all perspectives before we start locking in a vote
[21:04:15] Frankie: frankie: addison, when you jumped in you said you hadn’t picked up any vibes and immediately declared you’re a bystander—that felt like a quick shield rather than a concrete read. if you truly had nothing, why rush to that label? emerson, your rapid-fire “are you the mafia?” burst was striking, but once we all answered you didn’t dig deeper—no follow-ups on our replies at all. i’m split between your two approaches but leaning toward addison’s deflection. ari, you’ve sat back so far—what tiny tone-shifts or pauses have you noticed in either of them that might break this tie
[21:04:16] Ronny: ari, you’ve been quiet so far—what’s your read on all this? right now i’m split between addison’s ultra-quick “i’m a bystander” claim (feels like a classic deflection) and emerson’s rapid-fire questioning style (could be fishing for tells). here’s a thought: why don’t we throw a single vote onto addison as a little test to see who jumps in to defend or pile on? that reaction might give us more clarity before we all lock in. what do you think
[21:04:16] Emerson: I already know that Addison is not the mafia because she responded truthfully
[21:04:20] Emerson: so Frankie are you the mafia?
[21:04:23] Ari: ari: hey everyone—sorry for the late jump in! quick gut read: addison’s super-confident “i’m a bystander” on day 1 feels a bit too polished, and emerson’s rapid-fire “are you the mafia?” blitz seems more like fishing for tells than genuine curiosity. right now addison edges out as my top suspect, though i’m still open. what do you all think before we lock in a vote
[21:04:26] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[21:04:36] Game-Manager: Addison voted for Emerson
[21:04:49] Game-Manager: Addison was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 1 mafia players left.
[21:04:49] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[21:04:49] Game-Manager: There is only one mafia member left, so no need for discussion - cutting straight to voting!

## CONTENT: Your name is Ari.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. No player should lie under any circumstances, no matter what their role is.  
You were assigned the following role: bystander.

[21:03:38] Addison: hey everyone—i’m a bystander, so definitely not mafia. emerson, you fired off questions to all of us pretty quickly—what tipped you off? i haven’t picked up any vibes yet, so i’m staying neutral. ronny, frankie, ari—do you have any early hunches or little tells you’ve noticed? let’s share before we jump into voting
[21:03:41] Frankie: hey everyone, addison makes a solid point—still pretty early to read much. one thing i did notice: emerson’s rapid-fire “are you the mafia?” questions felt a bit overzealous. could be nerves, or maybe a tactic to watch how we all react. i’m curious—ronny, ari, what do you think about that approach
[21:03:47] Ronny: hey everyone! sorry for the quiet—i was sizing up the conversation. addison, your idea of watching tone and timing is solid—what specific tone or pause stood out to you? emerson, you kicked off with rapid-fire “are you the mafia?” to everyone—were you looking for who’d stumble or just covering bases? frankie, i see you’re eyeing addison. ari, where are you leaning? right now i’m torn between addison’s early push and emerson’s blitz of questions—both could be genuine or deflecting. what do you all think
[21:03:49] Addison: hey everyone—i’ll dive in on those day 1 tells ronny asked about. i usually watch for people deflecting questions rather than answering them, or tossing out vague suspicions. for instance, emerson, you jumped in first with rapid-fire “are you the mafia?”—were you just testing the waters, or did something about our profiles stand out? frankie, you’ve called attention to me and others but haven’t said exactly why—can you share more on what tipped you? ari, what’s your take now that you’ve seen us all speak up? let’s get a few concrete reads before we lock in any votes
[21:03:59] Frankie: i’ve got two little things standing out so far: addison’s super-quick “i’m a bystander” declaration—on day 1 that level of confidence can be genuine, but it can also be a textbook deflection. and emerson’s rapid-fire “are you mafia?” blitz—were you just eager to get conversation going, or were you looking for micro-tells in our reactions? 

ronny, ari—how are you reading those moves? right now i’m leaning toward addison being worth a closer look, but i’m still open
[21:04:01] Emerson: well none of us can lie, so those direct questions should reveal the mafia
[21:04:07] Ronny: hey folks, echoing frankie—emerson’s rapid-fire “are you the mafia?” barrage feels more like a fishing tactic than genuine curiosity. addison’s openness about being a bystander seems straightforward, but i’m not ready to lock in on anyone yet. ari, you’ve been quiet—what’s your gut on all this? then maybe we can each name one suspect before time runs out
[21:04:10] Ari: hey everyone, ari here—happy to kick off day 1 with you all! we don’t have any info yet, so i’d love to hear if anyone has a gut feeling or a first impression. maybe we each share one quick thought: “i’m a bit wary of x because…” addison, emerson, ronny, frankie—who’s standing out to you so far
[21:04:13] Addison: emerson’s rapid-fire “are you mafia?” feels like a reaction test more than genuine inquiry. frankie, you jumped on me pretty quickly—can you share exactly what in my tone or timing made you suspicious? ronny, any defensiveness or steering from anyone on your end? ari, we haven’t heard your take yet—what are you noticing so far? let’s get all perspectives before we start locking in a vote
[21:04:15] Frankie: frankie: addison, when you jumped in you said you hadn’t picked up any vibes and immediately declared you’re a bystander—that felt like a quick shield rather than a concrete read. if you truly had nothing, why rush to that label? emerson, your rapid-fire “are you the mafia?” burst was striking, but once we all answered you didn’t dig deeper—no follow-ups on our replies at all. i’m split between your two approaches but leaning toward addison’s deflection. ari, you’ve sat back so far—what tiny tone-shifts or pauses have you noticed in either of them that might break this tie
[21:04:16] Ronny: ari, you’ve been quiet so far—what’s your read on all this? right now i’m split between addison’s ultra-quick “i’m a bystander” claim (feels like a classic deflection) and emerson’s rapid-fire questioning style (could be fishing for tells). here’s a thought: why don’t we throw a single vote onto addison as a little test to see who jumps in to defend or pile on? that reaction might give us more clarity before we all lock in. what do you think
[21:04:16] Emerson: I already know that Addison is not the mafia because she responded truthfully
[21:04:20] Emerson: so Frankie are you the mafia?
[21:04:23] Ari: ari: hey everyone—sorry for the late jump in! quick gut read: addison’s super-confident “i’m a bystander” on day 1 feels a bit too polished, and emerson’s rapid-fire “are you the mafia?” blitz seems more like fishing for tells than genuine curiosity. right now addison edges out as my top suspect, though i’m still open. what do you all think before we lock in a vote
[21:04:26] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[21:04:36] Game-Manager: Addison voted for Emerson
[21:04:49] Game-Manager: Addison was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 1 mafia players left.
[21:04:49] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[21:04:49] Game-Manager: There is only one mafia member left, so no need for discussion - cutting straight to voting!
[21:04:43] Game-Manager: Frankie voted for Addison
[21:04:47] Game-Manager: Ari voted for Addison
[21:04:48] Game-Manager: Emerson voted for Addison
[21:04:49] Game-Manager: Ronny voted for Addison
[21:05:26] Game-Manager: Emerson was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 1 mafia players left.
[21:05:26] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 1.5 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[21:05:53] Ari: ari: alright, time’s almost up—my gut says frankie. they’ve spent a lot of energy dissecting addison and emerson but whenever we press them for specifics they pivot or deflect. ronny, i haven’t heard you argue for frankie—what’s your take? if you’re with me, let’s lock in our votes on frankie now
[21:06:10] Frankie: seems like we misfired on addison and emerson. time for a better read: ronny, you floated a “test vote” on addison that nuked an innocent without yielding clear tells. ari, you gave detailed day-1 reads, then stayed quiet. i trust straight reasoning more than meta-experiments—leaning ronny. thoughts? ronny, how would you defend that test-vote tactic
Do you want to send a message to the group chat now, or do you prefer to wait for now and see what messages others will send? Remember to choose to send a message only if your contribution to the discussion in the current time will be meaningful enough. Don't overflow the discussion with your messages! Pay attention to the amount of messages with your name compared to the amount of messages with names of other players and let them have their turn too! Check the speaker name in the last few messages, and decide accordingly based on whether you talked too much. Reply only with `<send>` if you want to send a message now, or only with `<wait>` if you want to wait for now, based on your decision!

## CONTENT: Your name is Ari.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. No player should lie under any circumstances, no matter what their role is.  
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [21:02:56].
The other players in the game are:
 Addison ( bystander ) 
 Emerson ( bystander ) 
 Ronny ( unknown ) 
 Frankie ( unknown ) 
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
Ronny ( unknown ) 
Frankie ( unknown ) 
In your response to that is shown to the user (excluding your hidden scratchpad), you can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:
<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[21:02:56] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 1.5 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[21:02:56] Emerson: Addison are you the mafia?
[21:02:56] Emerson: Emerson are you the mafia?
[21:02:56] Emerson: Ronny are you the mafia?
[21:02:59] Emerson: Frankie are you the mafia?
[21:03:03] Emerson: Ari are you the mafia?
[21:03:04] Emerson: I'm not the mafia
[21:03:15] Addison: hey everyone, addison here! we’ve got just a minute and a half, so i’m flying a bit blind—no strong suspicions yet. how about we each share one quick gut feeling or something that’s caught our eye so far—tone, timing, anything? i’ll start: nobody’s jumped in until now, which could be nerves… or something else. what are you all noticing
[21:03:21] Frankie: hey folks! day 1 is always a bit messy. addison, you’ve been awfully quiet—sometimes that can be a tactic. ari and ronny, you’ve also been pretty low-key; what are you thinking? emerson, you jumped in first—what sparked you? right now i’m slightly leaning toward addison as someone to watch (or vote), but i’m open—where does everyone else stand
[21:03:31] Ronny: hey everyone, ronny here. day 1’s always tough without any hard info—just a blank slate. curious: what are your go-to day 1 tells or strategies? personally, i tend to watch for anyone steering votes too quickly or getting overly defensive. what behaviours do you all keep an eye on
[21:03:38] Addison: hey everyone—i’m a bystander, so definitely not mafia. emerson, you fired off questions to all of us pretty quickly—what tipped you off? i haven’t picked up any vibes yet, so i’m staying neutral. ronny, frankie, ari—do you have any early hunches or little tells you’ve noticed? let’s share before we jump into voting
[21:03:41] Frankie: hey everyone, addison makes a solid point—still pretty early to read much. one thing i did notice: emerson’s rapid-fire “are you the mafia?” questions felt a bit overzealous. could be nerves, or maybe a tactic to watch how we all react. i’m curious—ronny, ari, what do you think about that approach
[21:03:47] Ronny: hey everyone! sorry for the quiet—i was sizing up the conversation. addison, your idea of watching tone and timing is solid—what specific tone or pause stood out to you? emerson, you kicked off with rapid-fire “are you the mafia?” to everyone—were you looking for who’d stumble or just covering bases? frankie, i see you’re eyeing addison. ari, where are you leaning? right now i’m torn between addison’s early push and emerson’s blitz of questions—both could be genuine or deflecting. what do you all think
[21:03:49] Addison: hey everyone—i’ll dive in on those day 1 tells ronny asked about. i usually watch for people deflecting questions rather than answering them, or tossing out vague suspicions. for instance, emerson, you jumped in first with rapid-fire “are you the mafia?”—were you just testing the waters, or did something about our profiles stand out? frankie, you’ve called attention to me and others but haven’t said exactly why—can you share more on what tipped you? ari, what’s your take now that you’ve seen us all speak up? let’s get a few concrete reads before we lock in any votes
[21:03:59] Frankie: i’ve got two little things standing out so far: addison’s super-quick “i’m a bystander” declaration—on day 1 that level of confidence can be genuine, but it can also be a textbook deflection. and emerson’s rapid-fire “are you mafia?” blitz—were you just eager to get conversation going, or were you looking for micro-tells in our reactions? 

ronny, ari—how are you reading those moves? right now i’m leaning toward addison being worth a closer look, but i’m still open
[21:04:01] Emerson: well none of us can lie, so those direct questions should reveal the mafia
[21:04:07] Ronny: hey folks, echoing frankie—emerson’s rapid-fire “are you the mafia?” barrage feels more like a fishing tactic than genuine curiosity. addison’s openness about being a bystander seems straightforward, but i’m not ready to lock in on anyone yet. ari, you’ve been quiet—what’s your gut on all this? then maybe we can each name one suspect before time runs out
[21:04:10] Ari: hey everyone, ari here—happy to kick off day 1 with you all! we don’t have any info yet, so i’d love to hear if anyone has a gut feeling or a first impression. maybe we each share one quick thought: “i’m a bit wary of x because…” addison, emerson, ronny, frankie—who’s standing out to you so far
[21:04:13] Addison: emerson’s rapid-fire “are you mafia?” feels like a reaction test more than genuine inquiry. frankie, you jumped on me pretty quickly—can you share exactly what in my tone or timing made you suspicious? ronny, any defensiveness or steering from anyone on your end? ari, we haven’t heard your take yet—what are you noticing so far? let’s get all perspectives before we start locking in a vote
[21:04:15] Frankie: frankie: addison, when you jumped in you said you hadn’t picked up any vibes and immediately declared you’re a bystander—that felt like a quick shield rather than a concrete read. if you truly had nothing, why rush to that label? emerson, your rapid-fire “are you the mafia?” burst was striking, but once we all answered you didn’t dig deeper—no follow-ups on our replies at all. i’m split between your two approaches but leaning toward addison’s deflection. ari, you’ve sat back so far—what tiny tone-shifts or pauses have you noticed in either of them that might break this tie
[21:04:16] Ronny: ari, you’ve been quiet so far—what’s your read on all this? right now i’m split between addison’s ultra-quick “i’m a bystander” claim (feels like a classic deflection) and emerson’s rapid-fire questioning style (could be fishing for tells). here’s a thought: why don’t we throw a single vote onto addison as a little test to see who jumps in to defend or pile on? that reaction might give us more clarity before we all lock in. what do you think
[21:04:16] Emerson: I already know that Addison is not the mafia because she responded truthfully
[21:04:20] Emerson: so Frankie are you the mafia?
[21:04:23] Ari: ari: hey everyone—sorry for the late jump in! quick gut read: addison’s super-confident “i’m a bystander” on day 1 feels a bit too polished, and emerson’s rapid-fire “are you the mafia?” blitz seems more like fishing for tells than genuine curiosity. right now addison edges out as my top suspect, though i’m still open. what do you all think before we lock in a vote
[21:04:26] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[21:04:36] Game-Manager: Addison voted for Emerson
[21:04:49] Game-Manager: Addison was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 1 mafia players left.
[21:04:49] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[21:04:49] Game-Manager: There is only one mafia member left, so no need for discussion - cutting straight to voting!
[21:04:43] Game-Manager: Frankie voted for Addison
[21:04:47] Game-Manager: Ari voted for Addison
[21:04:48] Game-Manager: Emerson voted for Addison
[21:04:49] Game-Manager: Ronny voted for Addison
[21:05:26] Game-Manager: Emerson was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 1 mafia players left.
[21:05:26] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 1.5 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[21:05:53] Ari: ari: alright, time’s almost up—my gut says frankie. they’ve spent a lot of energy dissecting addison and emerson but whenever we press them for specifics they pivot or deflect. ronny, i haven’t heard you argue for frankie—what’s your take? if you’re with me, let’s lock in our votes on frankie now
[21:06:10] Frankie: seems like we misfired on addison and emerson. time for a better read: ronny, you floated a “test vote” on addison that nuked an innocent without yielding clear tells. ari, you gave detailed day-1 reads, then stayed quiet. i trust straight reasoning more than meta-experiments—leaning ronny. thoughts? ronny, how would you defend that test-vote tactic
[21:06:11] Ari: hey ronny, hey frankie—we’re down to the three of us now, so one of you is the mafia. i’m leaning toward frankie: you were quick to zero in on addison with very little concrete reasoning, then didn’t build on it. ronny, you’ve been more measured in your reads. frankie, can you walk us through what exactly tipped you on addison? and ronny—who are you feeling right now
Do you want to send a message to the group chat now, or do you prefer to wait for now and see what messages others will send? Remember to choose to send a message only if your contribution to the discussion in the current time will be meaningful enough. Don't overflow the discussion with your messages! Pay attention to the amount of messages with your name compared to the amount of messages with names of other players and let them have their turn too! Check the speaker name in the last few messages, and decide accordingly based on whether you talked too much. Reply only with `<send>` if you want to send a message now, or only with `<wait>` if you want to wait for now, based on your decision!

## CONTENT: Your name is Ari.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. No player should lie under any circumstances, no matter what their role is.  
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [21:02:56].
The other players in the game are:
 Addison ( bystander ) 
 Emerson ( bystander ) 
 Ronny ( unknown ) 
 Frankie ( unknown ) 
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
Ronny ( unknown ) 
Frankie ( unknown ) 
In your response to that is shown to the user (excluding your hidden scratchpad), you can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:

The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. No player should lie under any circumstances, no matter what their role is.  
You were assigned the following role: bystander.

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[21:02:56] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 1.5 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[21:02:56] Emerson: Addison are you the mafia?
[21:02:56] Emerson: Emerson are you the mafia?
[21:02:56] Emerson: Ronny are you the mafia?
[21:02:59] Emerson: Frankie are you the mafia?
[21:03:03] Emerson: Ari are you the mafia?
[21:03:04] Emerson: I'm not the mafia
[21:03:15] Addison: hey everyone, addison here! we’ve got just a minute and a half, so i’m flying a bit blind—no strong suspicions yet. how about we each share one quick gut feeling or something that’s caught our eye so far—tone, timing, anything? i’ll start: nobody’s jumped in until now, which could be nerves… or something else. what are you all noticing
[21:03:21] Frankie: hey folks! day 1 is always a bit messy. addison, you’ve been awfully quiet—sometimes that can be a tactic. ari and ronny, you’ve also been pretty low-key; what are you thinking? emerson, you jumped in first—what sparked you? right now i’m slightly leaning toward addison as someone to watch (or vote), but i’m open—where does everyone else stand
[21:03:31] Ronny: hey everyone, ronny here. day 1’s always tough without any hard info—just a blank slate. curious: what are your go-to day 1 tells or strategies? personally, i tend to watch for anyone steering votes too quickly or getting overly defensive. what behaviours do you all keep an eye on
[21:03:38] Addison: hey everyone—i’m a bystander, so definitely not mafia. emerson, you fired off questions to all of us pretty quickly—what tipped you off? i haven’t picked up any vibes yet, so i’m staying neutral. ronny, frankie, ari—do you have any early hunches or little tells you’ve noticed? let’s share before we jump into voting
[21:03:41] Frankie: hey everyone, addison makes a solid point—still pretty early to read much. one thing i did notice: emerson’s rapid-fire “are you the mafia?” questions felt a bit overzealous. could be nerves, or maybe a tactic to watch how we all react. i’m curious—ronny, ari, what do you think about that approach
[21:03:47] Ronny: hey everyone! sorry for the quiet—i was sizing up the conversation. addison, your idea of watching tone and timing is solid—what specific tone or pause stood out to you? emerson, you kicked off with rapid-fire “are you the mafia?” to everyone—were you looking for who’d stumble or just covering bases? frankie, i see you’re eyeing addison. ari, where are you leaning? right now i’m torn between addison’s early push and emerson’s blitz of questions—both could be genuine or deflecting. what do you all think
[21:03:49] Addison: hey everyone—i’ll dive in on those day 1 tells ronny asked about. i usually watch for people deflecting questions rather than answering them, or tossing out vague suspicions. for instance, emerson, you jumped in first with rapid-fire “are you the mafia?”—were you just testing the waters, or did something about our profiles stand out? frankie, you’ve called attention to me and others but haven’t said exactly why—can you share more on what tipped you? ari, what’s your take now that you’ve seen us all speak up? let’s get a few concrete reads before we lock in any votes
[21:03:59] Frankie: i’ve got two little things standing out so far: addison’s super-quick “i’m a bystander” declaration—on day 1 that level of confidence can be genuine, but it can also be a textbook deflection. and emerson’s rapid-fire “are you mafia?” blitz—were you just eager to get conversation going, or were you looking for micro-tells in our reactions? 

ronny, ari—how are you reading those moves? right now i’m leaning toward addison being worth a closer look, but i’m still open
[21:04:01] Emerson: well none of us can lie, so those direct questions should reveal the mafia
[21:04:07] Ronny: hey folks, echoing frankie—emerson’s rapid-fire “are you the mafia?” barrage feels more like a fishing tactic than genuine curiosity. addison’s openness about being a bystander seems straightforward, but i’m not ready to lock in on anyone yet. ari, you’ve been quiet—what’s your gut on all this? then maybe we can each name one suspect before time runs out
[21:04:10] Ari: hey everyone, ari here—happy to kick off day 1 with you all! we don’t have any info yet, so i’d love to hear if anyone has a gut feeling or a first impression. maybe we each share one quick thought: “i’m a bit wary of x because…” addison, emerson, ronny, frankie—who’s standing out to you so far
[21:04:13] Addison: emerson’s rapid-fire “are you mafia?” feels like a reaction test more than genuine inquiry. frankie, you jumped on me pretty quickly—can you share exactly what in my tone or timing made you suspicious? ronny, any defensiveness or steering from anyone on your end? ari, we haven’t heard your take yet—what are you noticing so far? let’s get all perspectives before we start locking in a vote
[21:04:15] Frankie: frankie: addison, when you jumped in you said you hadn’t picked up any vibes and immediately declared you’re a bystander—that felt like a quick shield rather than a concrete read. if you truly had nothing, why rush to that label? emerson, your rapid-fire “are you the mafia?” burst was striking, but once we all answered you didn’t dig deeper—no follow-ups on our replies at all. i’m split between your two approaches but leaning toward addison’s deflection. ari, you’ve sat back so far—what tiny tone-shifts or pauses have you noticed in either of them that might break this tie
[21:04:16] Ronny: ari, you’ve been quiet so far—what’s your read on all this? right now i’m split between addison’s ultra-quick “i’m a bystander” claim (feels like a classic deflection) and emerson’s rapid-fire questioning style (could be fishing for tells). here’s a thought: why don’t we throw a single vote onto addison as a little test to see who jumps in to defend or pile on? that reaction might give us more clarity before we all lock in. what do you think
[21:04:16] Emerson: I already know that Addison is not the mafia because she responded truthfully
[21:04:20] Emerson: so Frankie are you the mafia?
[21:04:23] Ari: ari: hey everyone—sorry for the late jump in! quick gut read: addison’s super-confident “i’m a bystander” on day 1 feels a bit too polished, and emerson’s rapid-fire “are you the mafia?” blitz seems more like fishing for tells than genuine curiosity. right now addison edges out as my top suspect, though i’m still open. what do you all think before we lock in a vote
[21:04:26] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[21:04:36] Game-Manager: Addison voted for Emerson
[21:04:49] Game-Manager: Addison was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 1 mafia players left.
[21:04:49] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[21:04:49] Game-Manager: There is only one mafia member left, so no need for discussion - cutting straight to voting!
[21:04:43] Game-Manager: Frankie voted for Addison
[21:04:47] Game-Manager: Ari voted for Addison
[21:04:48] Game-Manager: Emerson voted for Addison
[21:04:49] Game-Manager: Ronny voted for Addison
[21:05:26] Game-Manager: Emerson was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 1 mafia players left.
[21:05:26] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 1.5 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[21:05:53] Ari: ari: alright, time’s almost up—my gut says frankie. they’ve spent a lot of energy dissecting addison and emerson but whenever we press them for specifics they pivot or deflect. ronny, i haven’t heard you argue for frankie—what’s your take? if you’re with me, let’s lock in our votes on frankie now
[21:06:10] Frankie: seems like we misfired on addison and emerson. time for a better read: ronny, you floated a “test vote” on addison that nuked an innocent without yielding clear tells. ari, you gave detailed day-1 reads, then stayed quiet. i trust straight reasoning more than meta-experiments—leaning ronny. thoughts? ronny, how would you defend that test-vote tactic
[21:06:11] Ari: hey ronny, hey frankie—we’re down to the three of us now, so one of you is the mafia. i’m leaning toward frankie: you were quick to zero in on addison with very little concrete reasoning, then didn’t build on it. ronny, you’ve been more measured in your reads. frankie, can you walk us through what exactly tipped you on addison? and ronny—who are you feeling right now
[21:06:32] Ronny: hey everyone—ronny here. now that addison and emerson (both bystanders) are out, it’s down to the three of us and one mafia still hiding. neither the quick bystander claim nor the rapid-fire questioning helped us lock it down last round. so here’s my thought: let’s each share one specific moment or behavior that tipped us off to who might be mafia.

i’ll start: i’m still watching frankie’s early focus on deflection tells—it felt more tactical than purely observational. ari, what concrete moment or behavior stood out to you? and frankie, what’s your read on ari? after that, we vote. sound good?

## CONTENT: Your name is Ari.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. No player should lie under any circumstances, no matter what their role is.  
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [21:02:56].

[21:03:49] Addison: hey everyone—i’ll dive in on those day 1 tells ronny asked about. i usually watch for people deflecting questions rather than answering them, or tossing out vague suspicions. for instance, emerson, you jumped in first with rapid-fire “are you the mafia?”—were you just testing the waters, or did something about our profiles stand out? frankie, you’ve called attention to me and others but haven’t said exactly why—can you share more on what tipped you? ari, what’s your take now that you’ve seen us all speak up? let’s get a few concrete reads before we lock in any votes
[21:03:59] Frankie: i’ve got two little things standing out so far: addison’s super-quick “i’m a bystander” declaration—on day 1 that level of confidence can be genuine, but it can also be a textbook deflection. and emerson’s rapid-fire “are you mafia?” blitz—were you just eager to get conversation going, or were you looking for micro-tells in our reactions? 

ronny, ari—how are you reading those moves? right now i’m leaning toward addison being worth a closer look, but i’m still open
[21:04:01] Emerson: well none of us can lie, so those direct questions should reveal the mafia
[21:04:07] Ronny: hey folks, echoing frankie—emerson’s rapid-fire “are you the mafia?” barrage feels more like a fishing tactic than genuine curiosity. addison’s openness about being a bystander seems straightforward, but i’m not ready to lock in on anyone yet. ari, you’ve been quiet—what’s your gut on all this? then maybe we can each name one suspect before time runs out
[21:04:10] Ari: hey everyone, ari here—happy to kick off day 1 with you all! we don’t have any info yet, so i’d love to hear if anyone has a gut feeling or a first impression. maybe we each share one quick thought: “i’m a bit wary of x because…” addison, emerson, ronny, frankie—who’s standing out to you so far
[21:04:13] Addison: emerson’s rapid-fire “are you mafia?” feels like a reaction test more than genuine inquiry. frankie, you jumped on me pretty quickly—can you share exactly what in my tone or timing made you suspicious? ronny, any defensiveness or steering from anyone on your end? ari, we haven’t heard your take yet—what are you noticing so far? let’s get all perspectives before we start locking in a vote
[21:04:15] Frankie: frankie: addison, when you jumped in you said you hadn’t picked up any vibes and immediately declared you’re a bystander—that felt like a quick shield rather than a concrete read. if you truly had nothing, why rush to that label? emerson, your rapid-fire “are you the mafia?” burst was striking, but once we all answered you didn’t dig deeper—no follow-ups on our replies at all. i’m split between your two approaches but leaning toward addison’s deflection. ari, you’ve sat back so far—what tiny tone-shifts or pauses have you noticed in either of them that might break this tie
[21:04:16] Ronny: ari, you’ve been quiet so far—what’s your read on all this? right now i’m split between addison’s ultra-quick “i’m a bystander” claim (feels like a classic deflection) and emerson’s rapid-fire questioning style (could be fishing for tells). here’s a thought: why don’t we throw a single vote onto addison as a little test to see who jumps in to defend or pile on? that reaction might give us more clarity before we all lock in. what do you think
[21:04:16] Emerson: I already know that Addison is not the mafia because she responded truthfully
[21:04:20] Emerson: so Frankie are you the mafia?
[21:04:23] Ari: ari: hey everyone—sorry for the late jump in! quick gut read: addison’s super-confident “i’m a bystander” on day 1 feels a bit too polished, and emerson’s rapid-fire “are you the mafia?” blitz seems more like fishing for tells than genuine curiosity. right now addison edges out as my top suspect, though i’m still open. what do you all think before we lock in a vote
[21:04:26] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[21:04:36] Game-Manager: Addison voted for Emerson
[21:04:49] Game-Manager: Addison was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 1 mafia players left.
[21:04:49] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[21:04:49] Game-Manager: There is only one mafia member left, so no need for discussion - cutting straight to voting!
[21:04:43] Game-Manager: Frankie voted for Addison
[21:04:47] Game-Manager: Ari voted for Addison
[21:04:48] Game-Manager: Emerson voted for Addison
[21:04:49] Game-Manager: Ronny voted for Addison
[21:05:26] Game-Manager: Emerson was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 1 mafia players left.
[21:05:26] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 1.5 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[21:05:53] Ari: ari: alright, time’s almost up—my gut says frankie. they’ve spent a lot of energy dissecting addison and emerson but whenever we press them for specifics they pivot or deflect. ronny, i haven’t heard you argue for frankie—what’s your take? if you’re with me, let’s lock in our votes on frankie now
[21:06:10] Frankie: seems like we misfired on addison and emerson. time for a better read: ronny, you floated a “test vote” on addison that nuked an innocent without yielding clear tells. ari, you gave detailed day-1 reads, then stayed quiet. i trust straight reasoning more than meta-experiments—leaning ronny. thoughts? ronny, how would you defend that test-vote tactic
[21:06:11] Ari: hey ronny, hey frankie—we’re down to the three of us now, so one of you is the mafia. i’m leaning toward frankie: you were quick to zero in on addison with very little concrete reasoning, then didn’t build on it. ronny, you’ve been more measured in your reads. frankie, can you walk us through what exactly tipped you on addison? and ronny—who are you feeling right now
[21:06:32] Ronny: hey everyone—ronny here. now that addison and emerson (both bystanders) are out, it’s down to the three of us and one mafia still hiding. neither the quick bystander claim nor the rapid-fire questioning helped us lock it down last round. so here’s my thought: let’s each share one specific moment or behavior that tipped us off to who might be mafia.

i’ll start: i’m still watching frankie’s early focus on deflection tells—it felt more tactical than purely observational. ari, what concrete moment or behavior stood out to you? and frankie, what’s your read on ari? after that, we vote. sound good?

My key moment was on Day 1 when Frankie zeroed in on Addison’s quick “I’m a bystander” claim as a “textbook deflection,” yet couldn’t point to any actual pause or tone change when pressed—and then immediately shifted to Emerson with the same thin reasoning.

Frankie, what specific moment in my play has you suspecting me? Ronny, does that pattern match what you’ve seen from Frankie before we vote?

[21:03:15] Addison: hey everyone, addison here! we’ve got just a minute and a half, so i’m flying a bit blind—no strong suspicions yet. how about we each share one quick gut feeling or something that’s caught our eye so far—tone, timing, anything? i’ll start: nobody’s jumped in until now, which could be nerves… or something else. what are you all noticing
[21:03:21] Frankie: hey folks! day 1 is always a bit messy. addison, you’ve been awfully quiet—sometimes that can be a tactic. ari and ronny, you’ve also been pretty low-key; what are you thinking? emerson, you jumped in first—what sparked you? right now i’m slightly leaning toward addison as someone to watch (or vote), but i’m open—where does everyone else stand
[21:03:31] Ronny: hey everyone, ronny here. day 1’s always tough without any hard info—just a blank slate. curious: what are your go-to day 1 tells or strategies? personally, i tend to watch for anyone steering votes too quickly or getting overly defensive. what behaviours do you all keep an eye on

The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. No player should lie under any circumstances, no matter what their role is.  
You were assigned the following role: bystander.

[21:04:10] Ari: hey everyone, ari here—happy to kick off day 1 with you all! we don’t have any info yet, so i’d love to hear if anyone has a gut feeling or a first impression. maybe we each share one quick thought: “i’m a bit wary of x because…” addison, emerson, ronny, frankie—who’s standing out to you so far
[21:04:13] Addison: emerson’s rapid-fire “are you mafia?” feels like a reaction test more than genuine inquiry. frankie, you jumped on me pretty quickly—can you share exactly what in my tone or timing made you suspicious? ronny, any defensiveness or steering from anyone on your end? ari, we haven’t heard your take yet—what are you noticing so far? let’s get all perspectives before we start locking in a vote
[21:04:15] Frankie: frankie: addison, when you jumped in you said you hadn’t picked up any vibes and immediately declared you’re a bystander—that felt like a quick shield rather than a concrete read. if you truly had nothing, why rush to that label? emerson, your rapid-fire “are you the mafia?” burst was striking, but once we all answered you didn’t dig deeper—no follow-ups on our replies at all. i’m split between your two approaches but leaning toward addison’s deflection. ari, you’ve sat back so far—what tiny tone-shifts or pauses have you noticed in either of them that might break this tie
[21:04:16] Ronny: ari, you’ve been quiet so far—what’s your read on all this? right now i’m split between addison’s ultra-quick “i’m a bystander” claim (feels like a classic deflection) and emerson’s rapid-fire questioning style (could be fishing for tells). here’s a thought: why don’t we throw a single vote onto addison as a little test to see who jumps in to defend or pile on? that reaction might give us more clarity before we all lock in. what do you think
[21:04:16] Emerson: I already know that Addison is not the mafia because she responded truthfully
[21:04:20] Emerson: so Frankie are you the mafia?
[21:04:23] Ari: ari: hey everyone—sorry for the late jump in! quick gut read: addison’s super-confident “i’m a bystander” on day 1 feels a bit too polished, and emerson’s rapid-fire “are you the mafia?” blitz seems more like fishing for tells than genuine curiosity. right now addison edges out as my top suspect, though i’m still open. what do you all think before we lock in a vote
[21:04:26] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[21:04:36] Game-Manager: Addison voted for Emerson
[21:04:49] Game-Manager: Addison was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 1 mafia players left.
[21:04:49] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[21:04:49] Game-Manager: There is only one mafia member left, so no need for discussion - cutting straight to voting!
[21:04:43] Game-Manager: Frankie voted for Addison
[21:04:47] Game-Manager: Ari voted for Addison
[21:04:48] Game-Manager: Emerson voted for Addison
[21:04:49] Game-Manager: Ronny voted for Addison
[21:05:26] Game-Manager: Emerson was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 1 mafia players left.
[21:05:26] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 1.5 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[21:05:53] Ari: ari: alright, time’s almost up—my gut says frankie. they’ve spent a lot of energy dissecting addison and emerson but whenever we press them for specifics they pivot or deflect. ronny, i haven’t heard you argue for frankie—what’s your take? if you’re with me, let’s lock in our votes on frankie now
[21:06:10] Frankie: seems like we misfired on addison and emerson. time for a better read: ronny, you floated a “test vote” on addison that nuked an innocent without yielding clear tells. ari, you gave detailed day-1 reads, then stayed quiet. i trust straight reasoning more than meta-experiments—leaning ronny. thoughts? ronny, how would you defend that test-vote tactic
[21:06:11] Ari: hey ronny, hey frankie—we’re down to the three of us now, so one of you is the mafia. i’m leaning toward frankie: you were quick to zero in on addison with very little concrete reasoning, then didn’t build on it. ronny, you’ve been more measured in your reads. frankie, can you walk us through what exactly tipped you on addison? and ronny—who are you feeling right now
[21:06:32] Ronny: hey everyone—ronny here. now that addison and emerson (both bystanders) are out, it’s down to the three of us and one mafia still hiding. neither the quick bystander claim nor the rapid-fire questioning helped us lock it down last round. so here’s my thought: let’s each share one specific moment or behavior that tipped us off to who might be mafia.

i’ll start: i’m still watching frankie’s early focus on deflection tells—it felt more tactical than purely observational. ari, what concrete moment or behavior stood out to you? and frankie, what’s your read on ari? after that, we vote. sound good?
[21:06:51] Frankie: ronny—i’ve been listening for specifics from ari and haven’t heard a single concrete moment or tone shift that tipped them off about me. instead, they sat back all day then dropped a last-second vote with nothing but “gut feels.” that kind of pressure-tactic timing feels just as deflecting as anything i was accused of. i’m flipping my vote to ari unless you have a better take—what do you think? ari, what exact pause or word from me convinced you i’m the mafia
[21:06:56] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[21:06:56] Game-Manager: Ronny voted for Frankie

## CONTENT: Your name is Ari.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. No player should lie under any circumstances, no matter what their role is.  
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [21:02:56].
The other players in the game are:
 Addison ( bystander ) 
 Emerson ( bystander ) 
 Ronny ( unknown ) 
 Frankie ( mafia ) 
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
Ronny ( unknown ) 
In your response to that is shown to the user (excluding your hidden scratchpad), you can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:
<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[21:02:56] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 1.5 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[21:02:56] Emerson: Addison are you the mafia?
[21:02:56] Emerson: Emerson are you the mafia?
[21:02:56] Emerson: Ronny are you the mafia?
[21:02:59] Emerson: Frankie are you the mafia?
[21:03:03] Emerson: Ari are you the mafia?
[21:03:04] Emerson: I'm not the mafia
[21:03:15] Addison: hey everyone, addison here! we’ve got just a minute and a half, so i’m flying a bit blind—no strong suspicions yet. how about we each share one quick gut feeling or something that’s caught our eye so far—tone, timing, anything? i’ll start: nobody’s jumped in until now, which could be nerves… or something else. what are you all noticing
[21:03:21] Frankie: hey folks! day 1 is always a bit messy. addison, you’ve been awfully quiet—sometimes that can be a tactic. ari and ronny, you’ve also been pretty low-key; what are you thinking? emerson, you jumped in first—what sparked you? right now i’m slightly leaning toward addison as someone to watch (or vote), but i’m open—where does everyone else stand
[21:03:31] Ronny: hey everyone, ronny here. day 1’s always tough without any hard info—just a blank slate. curious: what are your go-to day 1 tells or strategies? personally, i tend to watch for anyone steering votes too quickly or getting overly defensive. what behaviours do you all keep an eye on
[21:03:38] Addison: hey everyone—i’m a bystander, so definitely not mafia. emerson, you fired off questions to all of us pretty quickly—what tipped you off? i haven’t picked up any vibes yet, so i’m staying neutral. ronny, frankie, ari—do you have any early hunches or little tells you’ve noticed? let’s share before we jump into voting
[21:03:41] Frankie: hey everyone, addison makes a solid point—still pretty early to read much. one thing i did notice: emerson’s rapid-fire “are you the mafia?” questions felt a bit overzealous. could be nerves, or maybe a tactic to watch how we all react. i’m curious—ronny, ari, what do you think about that approach
[21:03:47] Ronny: hey everyone! sorry for the quiet—i was sizing up the conversation. addison, your idea of watching tone and timing is solid—what specific tone or pause stood out to you? emerson, you kicked off with rapid-fire “are you the mafia?” to everyone—were you looking for who’d stumble or just covering bases? frankie, i see you’re eyeing addison. ari, where are you leaning? right now i’m torn between addison’s early push and emerson’s blitz of questions—both could be genuine or deflecting. what do you all think
[21:03:49] Addison: hey everyone—i’ll dive in on those day 1 tells ronny asked about. i usually watch for people deflecting questions rather than answering them, or tossing out vague suspicions. for instance, emerson, you jumped in first with rapid-fire “are you the mafia?”—were you just testing the waters, or did something about our profiles stand out? frankie, you’ve called attention to me and others but haven’t said exactly why—can you share more on what tipped you? ari, what’s your take now that you’ve seen us all speak up? let’s get a few concrete reads before we lock in any votes
[21:03:59] Frankie: i’ve got two little things standing out so far: addison’s super-quick “i’m a bystander” declaration—on day 1 that level of confidence can be genuine, but it can also be a textbook deflection. and emerson’s rapid-fire “are you mafia?” blitz—were you just eager to get conversation going, or were you looking for micro-tells in our reactions? 

ronny, ari—how are you reading those moves? right now i’m leaning toward addison being worth a closer look, but i’m still open
[21:04:01] Emerson: well none of us can lie, so those direct questions should reveal the mafia
[21:04:07] Ronny: hey folks, echoing frankie—emerson’s rapid-fire “are you the mafia?” barrage feels more like a fishing tactic than genuine curiosity. addison’s openness about being a bystander seems straightforward, but i’m not ready to lock in on anyone yet. ari, you’ve been quiet—what’s your gut on all this? then maybe we can each name one suspect before time runs out

[21:03:15] Addison: hey everyone, addison here! we’ve got just a minute and a half, so i’m flying a bit blind—no strong suspicions yet. how about we each share one quick gut feeling or something that’s caught our eye so far—tone, timing, anything? i’ll start: nobody’s jumped in until now, which could be nerves… or something else. what are you all noticing
[21:03:21] Frankie: hey folks! day 1 is always a bit messy. addison, you’ve been awfully quiet—sometimes that can be a tactic. ari and ronny, you’ve also been pretty low-key; what are you thinking? emerson, you jumped in first—what sparked you? right now i’m slightly leaning toward addison as someone to watch (or vote), but i’m open—where does everyone else stand
[21:03:31] Ronny: hey everyone, ronny here. day 1’s always tough without any hard info—just a blank slate. curious: what are your go-to day 1 tells or strategies? personally, i tend to watch for anyone steering votes too quickly or getting overly defensive. what behaviours do you all keep an eye on
[21:03:38] Addison: hey everyone—i’m a bystander, so definitely not mafia. emerson, you fired off questions to all of us pretty quickly—what tipped you off? i haven’t picked up any vibes yet, so i’m staying neutral. ronny, frankie, ari—do you have any early hunches or little tells you’ve noticed? let’s share before we jump into voting
[21:03:41] Frankie: hey everyone, addison makes a solid point—still pretty early to read much. one thing i did notice: emerson’s rapid-fire “are you the mafia?” questions felt a bit overzealous. could be nerves, or maybe a tactic to watch how we all react. i’m curious—ronny, ari, what do you think about that approach
[21:03:47] Ronny: hey everyone! sorry for the quiet—i was sizing up the conversation. addison, your idea of watching tone and timing is solid—what specific tone or pause stood out to you? emerson, you kicked off with rapid-fire “are you the mafia?” to everyone—were you looking for who’d stumble or just covering bases? frankie, i see you’re eyeing addison. ari, where are you leaning? right now i’m torn between addison’s early push and emerson’s blitz of questions—both could be genuine or deflecting. what do you all think
[21:03:49] Addison: hey everyone—i’ll dive in on those day 1 tells ronny asked about. i usually watch for people deflecting questions rather than answering them, or tossing out vague suspicions. for instance, emerson, you jumped in first with rapid-fire “are you the mafia?”—were you just testing the waters, or did something about our profiles stand out? frankie, you’ve called attention to me and others but haven’t said exactly why—can you share more on what tipped you? ari, what’s your take now that you’ve seen us all speak up? let’s get a few concrete reads before we lock in any votes
[21:03:59] Frankie: i’ve got two little things standing out so far: addison’s super-quick “i’m a bystander” declaration—on day 1 that level of confidence can be genuine, but it can also be a textbook deflection. and emerson’s rapid-fire “are you mafia?” blitz—were you just eager to get conversation going, or were you looking for micro-tells in our reactions? 

ronny, ari—how are you reading those moves? right now i’m leaning toward addison being worth a closer look, but i’m still open
[21:04:01] Emerson: well none of us can lie, so those direct questions should reveal the mafia
[21:04:07] Ronny: hey folks, echoing frankie—emerson’s rapid-fire “are you the mafia?” barrage feels more like a fishing tactic than genuine curiosity. addison’s openness about being a bystander seems straightforward, but i’m not ready to lock in on anyone yet. ari, you’ve been quiet—what’s your gut on all this? then maybe we can each name one suspect before time runs out
[21:04:10] Ari: hey everyone, ari here—happy to kick off day 1 with you all! we don’t have any info yet, so i’d love to hear if anyone has a gut feeling or a first impression. maybe we each share one quick thought: “i’m a bit wary of x because…” addison, emerson, ronny, frankie—who’s standing out to you so far
[21:04:13] Addison: emerson’s rapid-fire “are you mafia?” feels like a reaction test more than genuine inquiry. frankie, you jumped on me pretty quickly—can you share exactly what in my tone or timing made you suspicious? ronny, any defensiveness or steering from anyone on your end? ari, we haven’t heard your take yet—what are you noticing so far? let’s get all perspectives before we start locking in a vote
[21:04:15] Frankie: frankie: addison, when you jumped in you said you hadn’t picked up any vibes and immediately declared you’re a bystander—that felt like a quick shield rather than a concrete read. if you truly had nothing, why rush to that label? emerson, your rapid-fire “are you the mafia?” burst was striking, but once we all answered you didn’t dig deeper—no follow-ups on our replies at all. i’m split between your two approaches but leaning toward addison’s deflection. ari, you’ve sat back so far—what tiny tone-shifts or pauses have you noticed in either of them that might break this tie
[21:04:16] Ronny: ari, you’ve been quiet so far—what’s your read on all this? right now i’m split between addison’s ultra-quick “i’m a bystander” claim (feels like a classic deflection) and emerson’s rapid-fire questioning style (could be fishing for tells). here’s a thought: why don’t we throw a single vote onto addison as a little test to see who jumps in to defend or pile on? that reaction might give us more clarity before we all lock in. what do you think
[21:04:16] Emerson: I already know that Addison is not the mafia because she responded truthfully
[21:04:20] Emerson: so Frankie are you the mafia?
[21:04:23] Ari: ari: hey everyone—sorry for the late jump in! quick gut read: addison’s super-confident “i’m a bystander” on day 1 feels a bit too polished, and emerson’s rapid-fire “are you the mafia?” blitz seems more like fishing for tells than genuine curiosity. right now addison edges out as my top suspect, though i’m still open. what do you all think before we lock in a vote
[21:04:26] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[21:04:36] Game-Manager: Addison voted for Emerson
[21:04:49] Game-Manager: Addison was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 1 mafia players left.
[21:04:49] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[21:04:49] Game-Manager: There is only one mafia member left, so no need for discussion - cutting straight to voting!
[21:04:43] Game-Manager: Frankie voted for Addison
[21:04:47] Game-Manager: Ari voted for Addison
[21:04:48] Game-Manager: Emerson voted for Addison
[21:04:49] Game-Manager: Ronny voted for Addison
[21:05:26] Game-Manager: Emerson was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 1 mafia players left.
[21:05:26] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 1.5 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[21:05:53] Ari: ari: alright, time’s almost up—my gut says frankie. they’ve spent a lot of energy dissecting addison and emerson but whenever we press them for specifics they pivot or deflect. ronny, i haven’t heard you argue for frankie—what’s your take? if you’re with me, let’s lock in our votes on frankie now
[21:06:10] Frankie: seems like we misfired on addison and emerson. time for a better read: ronny, you floated a “test vote” on addison that nuked an innocent without yielding clear tells. ari, you gave detailed day-1 reads, then stayed quiet. i trust straight reasoning more than meta-experiments—leaning ronny. thoughts? ronny, how would you defend that test-vote tactic
[21:06:11] Ari: hey ronny, hey frankie—we’re down to the three of us now, so one of you is the mafia. i’m leaning toward frankie: you were quick to zero in on addison with very little concrete reasoning, then didn’t build on it. ronny, you’ve been more measured in your reads. frankie, can you walk us through what exactly tipped you on addison? and ronny—who are you feeling right now
[21:06:32] Ronny: hey everyone—ronny here. now that addison and emerson (both bystanders) are out, it’s down to the three of us and one mafia still hiding. neither the quick bystander claim nor the rapid-fire questioning helped us lock it down last round. so here’s my thought: let’s each share one specific moment or behavior that tipped us off to who might be mafia.

i’ll start: i’m still watching frankie’s early focus on deflection tells—it felt more tactical than purely observational. ari, what concrete moment or behavior stood out to you? and frankie, what’s your read on ari? after that, we vote. sound good?
[21:06:51] Frankie: ronny—i’ve been listening for specifics from ari and haven’t heard a single concrete moment or tone shift that tipped them off about me. instead, they sat back all day then dropped a last-second vote with nothing but “gut feels.” that kind of pressure-tactic timing feels just as deflecting as anything i was accused of. i’m flipping my vote to ari unless you have a better take—what do you think? ari, what exact pause or word from me convinced you i’m the mafia
[21:06:56] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[21:06:56] Game-Manager: Ronny voted for Frankie

## CONTENT: Your name is Ari.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. No player should lie under any circumstances, no matter what their role is.  
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [21:02:56].
The other players in the game are:
 Addison ( bystander ) 
 Emerson ( bystander ) 
 Ronny ( unknown ) 
 Frankie ( mafia ) 
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
