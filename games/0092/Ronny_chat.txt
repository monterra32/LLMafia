[21:03:31] Ronny: hey everyone, ronny here. day 1’s always tough without any hard info—just a blank slate. curious: what are your go-to day 1 tells or strategies? personally, i tend to watch for anyone steering votes too quickly or getting overly defensive. what behaviours do you all keep an eye on
[21:03:47] Ronny: hey everyone! sorry for the quiet—i was sizing up the conversation. addison, your idea of watching tone and timing is solid—what specific tone or pause stood out to you? emerson, you kicked off with rapid-fire “are you the mafia?” to everyone—were you looking for who’d stumble or just covering bases? frankie, i see you’re eyeing addison. ari, where are you leaning? right now i’m torn between addison’s early push and emerson’s blitz of questions—both could be genuine or deflecting. what do you all think
[21:04:07] Ronny: hey folks, echoing frankie—emerson’s rapid-fire “are you the mafia?” barrage feels more like a fishing tactic than genuine curiosity. addison’s openness about being a bystander seems straightforward, but i’m not ready to lock in on anyone yet. ari, you’ve been quiet—what’s your gut on all this? then maybe we can each name one suspect before time runs out
[21:04:16] Ronny: ari, you’ve been quiet so far—what’s your read on all this? right now i’m split between addison’s ultra-quick “i’m a bystander” claim (feels like a classic deflection) and emerson’s rapid-fire questioning style (could be fishing for tells). here’s a thought: why don’t we throw a single vote onto addison as a little test to see who jumps in to defend or pile on? that reaction might give us more clarity before we all lock in. what do you think
[21:06:32] Ronny: hey everyone—ronny here. now that addison and emerson (both bystanders) are out, it’s down to the three of us and one mafia still hiding. neither the quick bystander claim nor the rapid-fire questioning helped us lock it down last round. so here’s my thought: let’s each share one specific moment or behavior that tipped us off to who might be mafia.

i’ll start: i’m still watching frankie’s early focus on deflection tells—it felt more tactical than purely observational. ari, what concrete moment or behavior stood out to you? and frankie, what’s your read on ari? after that, we vote. sound good?
[21:09:28] Ronny: ronny: i’m sticking with my vote on frankie. frankie, you’ve spent the whole day accusing others of “deflection” and gut-feels, but you still haven’t given one concrete moment or tone-shift that actually made you suspicious. you pointed at addison’s quick bystander claim and ari’s last-second vote, then danced around every follow-up question—that’s classic mafia misdirection, not bystander analysis. ari, you flagged that same pressure-tactic timing—are you locking in frankie with me so we can end this
