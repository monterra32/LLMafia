[21:03:21] Frankie: hey folks! day 1 is always a bit messy. addison, you’ve been awfully quiet—sometimes that can be a tactic. ari and ronny, you’ve also been pretty low-key; what are you thinking? emerson, you jumped in first—what sparked you? right now i’m slightly leaning toward addison as someone to watch (or vote), but i’m open—where does everyone else stand
[21:03:41] Frankie: hey everyone, addison makes a solid point—still pretty early to read much. one thing i did notice: emerson’s rapid-fire “are you the mafia?” questions felt a bit overzealous. could be nerves, or maybe a tactic to watch how we all react. i’m curious—ronny, ari, what do you think about that approach
[21:03:59] Frankie: i’ve got two little things standing out so far: addison’s super-quick “i’m a bystander” declaration—on day 1 that level of confidence can be genuine, but it can also be a textbook deflection. and emerson’s rapid-fire “are you mafia?” blitz—were you just eager to get conversation going, or were you looking for micro-tells in our reactions? 

ronny, ari—how are you reading those moves? right now i’m leaning toward addison being worth a closer look, but i’m still open
[21:04:15] Frankie: frankie: addison, when you jumped in you said you hadn’t picked up any vibes and immediately declared you’re a bystander—that felt like a quick shield rather than a concrete read. if you truly had nothing, why rush to that label? emerson, your rapid-fire “are you the mafia?” burst was striking, but once we all answered you didn’t dig deeper—no follow-ups on our replies at all. i’m split between your two approaches but leaning toward addison’s deflection. ari, you’ve sat back so far—what tiny tone-shifts or pauses have you noticed in either of them that might break this tie
[21:06:10] Frankie: seems like we misfired on addison and emerson. time for a better read: ronny, you floated a “test vote” on addison that nuked an innocent without yielding clear tells. ari, you gave detailed day-1 reads, then stayed quiet. i trust straight reasoning more than meta-experiments—leaning ronny. thoughts? ronny, how would you defend that test-vote tactic
[21:06:51] Frankie: ronny—i’ve been listening for specifics from ari and haven’t heard a single concrete moment or tone shift that tipped them off about me. instead, they sat back all day then dropped a last-second vote with nothing but “gut feels.” that kind of pressure-tactic timing feels just as deflecting as anything i was accused of. i’m flipping my vote to ari unless you have a better take—what do you think? ari, what exact pause or word from me convinced you i’m the mafia
[21:09:40] Frankie: game-manager: frankie was voted out. their role was mafia. bystanders win
