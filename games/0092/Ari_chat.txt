[21:04:10] Ari: hey everyone, ari here—happy to kick off day 1 with you all! we don’t have any info yet, so i’d love to hear if anyone has a gut feeling or a first impression. maybe we each share one quick thought: “i’m a bit wary of x because…” addison, emerson, ronny, frankie—who’s standing out to you so far
[21:04:23] Ari: ari: hey everyone—sorry for the late jump in! quick gut read: addison’s super-confident “i’m a bystander” on day 1 feels a bit too polished, and emerson’s rapid-fire “are you the mafia?” blitz seems more like fishing for tells than genuine curiosity. right now addison edges out as my top suspect, though i’m still open. what do you all think before we lock in a vote
[21:05:53] Ari: ari: alright, time’s almost up—my gut says frankie. they’ve spent a lot of energy dissecting addison and emerson but whenever we press them for specifics they pivot or deflect. ronny, i haven’t heard you argue for frankie—what’s your take? if you’re with me, let’s lock in our votes on frankie now
[21:06:11] Ari: hey ronny, hey frankie—we’re down to the three of us now, so one of you is the mafia. i’m leaning toward frankie: you were quick to zero in on addison with very little concrete reasoning, then didn’t build on it. ronny, you’ve been more measured in your reads. frankie, can you walk us through what exactly tipped you on addison? and ronny—who are you feeling right now
[21:09:12] Ari: ari: i’m casting my vote for frankie. you’ve never pointed to a concrete word, pause, or behavior of mine—just gut reads and deflections. ronny has highlighted specific tactics you used (the early focus on “deflection tells”), whereas your accusations have stayed vague. that inconsistency makes you the likeliest suspect. vote frankie
