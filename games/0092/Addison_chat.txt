[21:03:15] Addison: hey everyone, addison here! we’ve got just a minute and a half, so i’m flying a bit blind—no strong suspicions yet. how about we each share one quick gut feeling or something that’s caught our eye so far—tone, timing, anything? i’ll start: nobody’s jumped in until now, which could be nerves… or something else. what are you all noticing
[21:03:38] Addison: hey everyone—i’m a bystander, so definitely not mafia. emerson, you fired off questions to all of us pretty quickly—what tipped you off? i haven’t picked up any vibes yet, so i’m staying neutral. ronny, frankie, ari—do you have any early hunches or little tells you’ve noticed? let’s share before we jump into voting
[21:03:49] Addison: hey everyone—i’ll dive in on those day 1 tells ronny asked about. i usually watch for people deflecting questions rather than answering them, or tossing out vague suspicions. for instance, emerson, you jumped in first with rapid-fire “are you the mafia?”—were you just testing the waters, or did something about our profiles stand out? frankie, you’ve called attention to me and others but haven’t said exactly why—can you share more on what tipped you? ari, what’s your take now that you’ve seen us all speak up? let’s get a few concrete reads before we lock in any votes
[21:04:13] Addison: emerson’s rapid-fire “are you mafia?” feels like a reaction test more than genuine inquiry. frankie, you jumped on me pretty quickly—can you share exactly what in my tone or timing made you suspicious? ronny, any defensiveness or steering from anyone on your end? ari, we haven’t heard your take yet—what are you noticing so far? let’s get all perspectives before we start locking in a vote
