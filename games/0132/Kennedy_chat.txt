[17:33:26] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! happy day 1. since we’re starting with zero hard info, i thought it’d be fun (and useful) to share our day 1 detective styles. personally, i watch for folks who either jump in to lead the charge way too quickly or stay eerily quiet. what about you all—do you look for pushiness, silence, odd deflections, or something else when you’re hunting mafia on day 1
[17:33:49] Kennedy: hey everyone, kennedy here! for my first gut read, i’m kind of eyeing ray – that quick pivot to cast suspicion on sam and dakota feels a bit too neat. i’m not locking in my vote yet, but that’s where my instincts are nudging me. i’d also love to hear more from sam, since you’ve been quiet after your initial comment. how’s everyone else feeling? let’s toss out those hunches and see if any patterns emerge before we start voting
[17:34:20] Kennedy: hey ray—i’ve been tuning into response speed and follow-ups. parker’s apology was instant but pretty light on detail, almost canned. sam, you flagged parker quickly but didn’t press dakota on their similar quiet vibes—what made parker stand out more? and dakota, you’ve circled back to parker twice now—what changed after your first hunch that made you so sure? it feels a bit like a coordinated echo. let’s see sam and dakota cross-examine each other’s reads before we push a vote
[17:34:41] Kennedy: hey everyone, jumping in on ray’s question about pushiness or dodges:

• parker, your last few posts lean heavily on “what do you think?” without offering your own read—feels like deflection rather than committing to a suspect.  
• ray, your “zero hard reads” pivot came right after flagging sam and dakota—but you didn’t back it up with any concrete examples, which also reads a bit safe.  

sam, when you flagged dakota as “too calm,” which exact phrase or tone did you pick up on? dakota, can you point to the wording in parker’s posts that felt off? let’s get textual so we can see if these hunches hold up. personally i’m still wavering on ray, but if we see parker doubling down on questions without specifics, i may shift my lean. thoughts?
[17:34:53] Kennedy: i’ll go with ray – that sudden shift from near-silence to grilling everyone for tiny details feels more like a stalling/info-mining tactic than genuine town play
