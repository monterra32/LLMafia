[17:33:23] Ray: hey everyone—ray here! excited to be playing. since we haven’t heard anything yet, i’m holding off on a vote and just gathering thoughts. sam and dakota have been awfully quiet so far—does that strike anyone as odd? parker, kennedy, what are you both picking up? i’d love to hear your gut reads before we jump on anyone
[17:33:43] Ray: hey everyone, good points so far. parker, i admit i was quiet at first—i was just sizing up the room. sam, your call-out of dakota felt pretty quick; what exactly about their calm tone threw you off? and kennedy, you’ve been fairly neutral so far—anything in anyone’s phrasing or timing that strikes you as odd? let’s get some specifics before we lock in a vote
[17:34:13] Ray: hey all—lots of good points on silence and calm as tells, but we’re still on day 1 with zero hard reads. let’s see some specifics:

• dakota, you flagged parker’s quiet—was it a delayed reply, unusual phrasing, or something else that really stood out?  
• sam, you noted dakota’s calm—what message or reaction felt too composed versus just thoughtful?  
• parker, you mentioned my quiet—beyond being low-key, did you catch any odd timing or phrasing?  
• kennedy, you brought up pushiness vs. silence—have you seen anyone here actually push too hard or dodge a question in a suspicious way?

i’m neutral for now; let’s dig into concrete examples before we lock in a vote
[17:34:46] Ray: hey everyone, let me get specific on what i’ve been seeing: when i said sam and dakota were quiet, i meant sam’s first post was just a quick two-liner echoing dakota’s vibe, and dakota’s follow-ups have been calls for details rather than solid reads of anyone. parker, you kicked off by flagging my silence, then spent the bulk of your posts drilling us for specifics without ever offering your own real gut read on someone else. that kind of meta-questioning over substance feels more like deflection than townie behavior. so for now i’m leaning parker. parker, can you give us one clear read on someone beyond pointing out my word count? sam, kennedy, dakota—does that logic line up with what you’re seeing
