[17:33:09] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here—excited to get started! since it’s day 1, how about we each share one early hunch on who might be mafia and why? i’ll go first: i’m a bit suspicious of parker—seems awfully quiet for a newbie round. what do you think, ray? sam? kennedy
[17:33:27] Dakota: hey everyone, dakota here! first day jitters for me, but let’s get the ball rolling. i noticed parker’s been pretty quiet so far—probably just feeling things out, but it stood out to me. sam, ray, kennedy, what are you all thinking? any odd vibes or gut hunches on who might be shady? let’s hear it before we start voting
[17:33:54] Dakota: dakota: my day 1 style is drilling into the specifics behind gut reads—silent accusations, sudden shifts, that sort of thing. ray, when you said sam and i were “awfully quiet,” what exactly struck you as odd? sam, what cue in my tone felt “too calm”? and parker, what about ray’s silence made you suspicious? pinpointing those triggers could help us see if any patterns line up
[17:34:05] Dakota: hey parker—aside from low word count, your questions feel a bit like deflection (“what do you think?”) instead of offering your own read. that shifting without specifics makes me uneasy. my one pick right now is ray: he was quick to cast suspicion on sam and me but hasn’t given concrete examples why.  

ray, can you walk us through exactly what you saw in our posts that set off alarm bells?  
sam, what would parker need to say or do for you to feel more confident he’s town?  
kennedy, since you’re also eyeing ray, anything else in his phrasing or timing that sticks out?
