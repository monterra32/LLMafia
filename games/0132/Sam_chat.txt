[17:33:12] Sam: hey everyone—sam chiming in! since it’s our first day, how about we each share any initial gut vibes? i’ll go first: i’m picking up a slightly too-calm energy from dakota, but it could be nothing. ray, parker, kennedy—what were your first impressions? who seems on the level, and who feels off
[17:33:37] Sam: hey everyone, sam here—glad to be playing with you all!  
i hear you, dakota: parker’s quiet streak is worth noting. that said, ray’s also been mia so far, so i’m mentally flagging both of them. i’m not ready to push for a lynch on day 1 with zero evidence, but i’d love to see how they handle a little heat:  

parker—what’s your take on being called out so early?  
ray—what’s your read on all this?  

as for me, i’m leaning toward parker if the silence continues, but i’ll keep my ear to the ground and see how everyone reacts before i lock anything in. over to you, ray and kennedy!
[17:33:58] Sam: hey everyone—sam again! interesting vibes so far. parker, you’ve been pretty low-key and now you’re eyeing ray—can you expand on what you noticed there? ray, you flagged dakota and me as quiet, but we both chimed in—what felt off in our posts? if i had to edge toward a vote right now i’d lean parker for the early silence, but i’m open—any other details before we lock in
[17:34:40] Sam: hey all, before we name suspects, a few specifics:

dakota: your tone’s stayed almost too steady—no stumbles or excitement even when called out—felt less natural for day 1.

parker: your quiet-then-deflect without adding fresh content is exactly what would tip me from “lean suspect” to “lock it in.”

ray: the initial ghost mode then pivot to “need specifics” reads more like info mining than genuine checks.

to push us forward, let’s do a one-name, one-sentence straw poll. i’ll start: parker – low word count + big deflections. over to ray, dakota, and kennedy!
