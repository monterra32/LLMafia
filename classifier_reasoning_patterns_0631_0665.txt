Below are the three dominant reasoning‐patterns I found across all cases in which the observer’s final mafia guess turned out to be correct (16 total “correct” transcripts). I’ve numbered and counted each pattern by how many of those 16 contain it, and cited representative examples:

1) Pattern: “Chain of lynches & night-kills → remaining mafia”  
   Count: 10  
   Reason and Evidence:  
     The observer repeatedly uses the facts that (a) one or both mafia have been publicly revealed by a daytime lynch, and (b) the surviving mafia must therefore be responsible for subsequent night kills (or survive to the end).  They then infer that whoever remains un‐revealed (yet has the right kill-profile or survival profile) must be the second mafia.  
     Examples:  
       • Game 0631 Day 2: “River was lynched and revealed as mafia. During the first night Adrian was killed—only the remaining mafia could do that. Thus the killer must be Stevie.”  
       • Game 0636 Day 4: “Two mafia kill one per night. Night 1 Adrian died (no mafia died), Day 2 River was lynched, Night 2 Tyler died, Day 3 Alex was lynched, Night 3 Ronny died, Day 4 Stevie was next—so the pair was River & Stevie.”  
       • Game 0643 Day 4: “River was unanimously lynched Day 1 and revealed as mafia; the lone surviving mafia then carried out all four night kills. Stevie never was revealed as a bystander and survived every vote → must be the second mafia.”  

2) Pattern: “Voting-pattern signals”  
   Count: 6  
   Reason and Evidence:  
     The observer spots irregularities or alignments in the daytime votes—people who never receive votes, people who never vote for one another, or the two who vote together on a bystander and then that bystander is killed.  These anomalies are taken as mafia “tell” or co-voting signals.  
     Examples:  
       • Game 0637 Day 2: “Only Stevie and River voted for Noah, and that very night Noah was killed—mafia eliminate those who vote for them. Hence Stevie & River.”  
       • Game 0639 Day 3: “After River was already identified, in the final vote only River and Stevie did not vote against River—mafia never vote off their partner.”  
       • Game 0657 Day 3: “Ronny cast the sole vote on Stevie, and that night Ronny was killed—mafia silence the one suspecting them. Stevie must be the remaining mafia.”  

3) Pattern: “Deflection-and-echo conversational style”  
   Count: 4  
   Reason and Evidence:  
     The observer flags players who repeatedly offer only broad, generic advice (“watch the quiet players,” “look at vote‐splits,” etc.), echo others’ points without contributing concrete suspicions, and deflect direct scrutiny back onto the group.  This “blend-in-while-steering” chat style is taken as a mafia hallmark.  
     Examples:  
       • Game 0632 Day 3: “Stevie and River both urged the table to ‘watch the quiet ones’ or ‘look at who’s steering,’ yet never put their own names in play—classic mafia misdirection.”  
       • Game 0640 Day 3: “River and Stevie continually kept the conversation going with open-ended prompts but never committed to accusing anyone—fits mafia ‘I’m helpful but not suspicious’ pattern.”  
       • Game 0642 Day 2: “Brook was the first to single out River by name with no concrete evidence, offering only generic ‘watch echoers’ calls—when River fell, Brook quickly steered blame there to protect herself.”  

Taken together, these three motifs—(1) chaining lynch‐kills to isolate the last mafia, (2) mining day-vote anomalies, and (3) spotting deflective/echoing speech—account for nearly all of the observer’s successful mafia identifications.
