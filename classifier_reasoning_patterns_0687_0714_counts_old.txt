Pattern: Early or Proactive Voting/Accusation  
Count: 42  
Reason and Evidence: A frequent tell is a player being the first or among the first to suggest someone for lynching or to cast a vote—with little to no discussion or evidence—ostensibly to steer the group. This “jumping the gun” often recurs in mafia reasoning.  
Examples:  
- Game 0687, Day 1: “Marissa Hernandez initiated the idea of eliminating the first person on the list…”  
- Game 0690, Day 1: “Justin Scott was quick to suggest letting Christopher go home…without a solid basis.”  
- Game 0691, Day 1: “Richard Johnson quickly accused Kimberly Sullivan without much discussion…”  
- Game 0692, Day 1: “Matthew Bridges was the first to vote, and he chose Bob Woods without any prior discussion.”  
- Game 0698, Day 1: “Elizabeth Andrews was the first to vote, and she voted for Melissa Hunt, who was not a popular choice…”  

Pattern: Quick Alignment or Support  
Count: 15  
Reason and Evidence: Mafia often back up each other’s proposals almost instantaneously, demonstrating coordination. A rapid “me too” vote or a swift public endorsement can be a sign of shared roles.  
Examples:  
- Game 0687, Day 1: “John Willis immediately supported Marissa’s suggestion and was the first to vote for Alexander Rhodes.”  
- Game 0690, Day 1: “Shane Bell immediately voted for Justin Scott after Justin’s comment, distancing behavior that can be collusion.”  
- Game 0691, Day 1: “Paul Silva immediately supported the vote against Kimberly Sullivan after Richard’s accusation.”  
- Game 0701, Day 1: “Elizabeth Mason quickly followed Cody’s lead in voting for Kelly Lopez.”  
- Game 0713, Day 1: “Valerie White supported Laura Pena’s suggestion to suspect Johnny Stevens as mafia.”  

Pattern: Lack of Substantial Reasoning or Evidence  
Count: 21  
Reason and Evidence: Observers often flag players who accuse or vote without presenting any logical justification—“no evidence” or “just a feeling”—as mafia. This pattern of baseless accusations recurs in many transcripts.  
Examples:  
- Game 0687, Day 1: “Her proactive approach…without much discussion or evidence suggests she might be mafia.”  
- Game 0690, Day 1: “Justin Scott…direct suspicion towards Christopher early in the day without a solid basis.”  
- Game 0691, Day 1: “Richard Johnson quickly accused Kimberly Sullivan without prior discussion.”  
- Game 0696, Day 1: “Mr. Michael Nelson Jr. was very quick to accuse Julian Barrett without any substantial evidence.”  
- Game 0697, Day 1: “Benjamin Pollard…had a vote already somehow?…no reasoning for their focus.”  
- Game 0714, Day 1: “Deborah Alvarez was very quick to accuse Patrick Gonzales…without substantial evidence.”  

Pattern: Slip-Ups or Accidental Reveals  
Count: 3  
Reason and Evidence: Occasional “Freudian slips” or accidental role-revealing language (“Mafioso!”) are flagged as strong indicators. They tend to appear in a small number of games but are high-value clues.  
Examples:  
- Game 0688, Day 1: “Jerry Pearson’s slip-up…saying ‘Mafioso!’ after trying to sound innocent.”  
- Game 0688, Day 2: “Jerry’s accidental slip-up…possibly revealing his true role.”  
- Game 0688, Day 3: “He made a slip by saying ‘Mafioso!’ which seems like a self-incriminating slip-up.”  

Pattern: Consistent Voting Alignment Across Rounds  
Count: 14  
Reason and Evidence: Mafia teammates often vote together consistently over multiple rounds to ensure their targets fall. Persistent two-person voting blocs that pick off bystanders in sequence are a common mafia signature.  
Examples:  
- Game 0687, Day 1: “John Willis immediately supported Marissa’s suggestion…indicative of potential mafia collaboration.”  
- Game 0689, Day 1: “Kimberly Harrison and Christopher Drake both voted for William Rubio…aligned in steering the conversation.”  
- Game 0694, Day 2: “Benjamin Wright and Colin Case both consistently voted together…targeted William Rubio and Felicia Schwartz.”  
- Game 0698, Day 2: “Jamie Burch and Rachel Costa both voted for Frank Steele and Erin Blevins…their consistent votes against bystanders.”  
- Game 0705, Day 2: “Dana Wilson and Michael Carter consistently voted together against Shannon Ryan and Tamara Wilkinson.”
