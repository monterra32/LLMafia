Game 0631, Day 1:
 Actual Mafia: River
Stevie 
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: River, Tyler  \n', 'Reason:  \n', '1. River was lynched and revealed as mafia. We know there must be one more.  \n', '2. Examining the vote distribution, everyone except River and Adrian received at least one vote; Tyler received zero votes despite being heavily discussed as a suspect throughout the day.  \n', '3. Tyler’s play‐style matched typical mafia behavior: they spoke a lot with broad, general advice, deflected direct scrutiny with humor and emojis, and never committed to any concrete suspicions—yet steered the group onto other targets.  \n', '4. At night the mafia killed Adrian, one of the most vocal town contributors, a move more consistent with mafia removing a threat than with a bystander or town player.  \n', '5. Combining Tyler’s unassailable voting record, deflective messaging, and the night kill’s target profile, Tyler fits the profile of the second mafia member.']

Game 0631, Day 2:
 Actual Mafia: River
Stevie 
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: River, Stevie\n', '\n', 'Reason:\n', '1. At the end of the first daytime vote, River was lynched and revealed as mafia.  \n', '2. During the first night, Adrian (a bystander) was killed—only the remaining mafia could perform a night kill, so the killer must have been the other mafia.  \n', '3. On the second daytime, the group voted out Stevie, who then revealed themselves as mafia.  \n', '4. Thus the two mafia were River and Stevie.']

Game 0632, Day 1:
 Actual Mafia: River
Stevie 
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: Alex, Tyler\n', '\n', 'Reason:  \n', '1. Vote patterns – Alex and Tyler were among the four players (with Ronny and Brook) who actively pushed to lynch Elliot (a bystander), and both cast their votes for him. This coordination is typical of mafia working together to eliminate innocents.  \n', '2. Conversation steering – Alex repeatedly steered suspicion onto others (naming both Elliot and Tyler), a common mafia tactic to deflect attention from themselves. Tyler quietly went along without publicly defending Alex’s claim against him, which is consistent with mafia avoiding drawing extra scrutiny on their partnership.  \n', '3. Night kill choice – The mafia killed Adrian, who had specifically called out Alex as potentially guiding the discussion. Removing Adrian silenced a direct accuser of Alex, indicating Alex had a vested interest in that kill, and Tyler as Alex’s partner would have agreed.  \n', 'Together, these elements—coordinated votes, deflection of suspicion, and the choice of night victim—point to Alex and Tyler as the two mafia.']

Game 0632, Day 2:
 Actual Mafia: River
Stevie 
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: Stevie, Brook\n', '\n', 'Reason:  \n', '1. Voting records show both Stevie and Brook were never genuine targets of suspicion—no one voted for Stevie on either Day 1 or Day 2, and Brook likewise escaped any votes. Innocents tend to draw some heat, but these two rode under the radar.  \n', '2. Brook consistently voted with the largest blocs (Day 1 on Elliot, Day 2 on Tyler) without offering any real justification—classic “blend in with the crowd” behavior.  \n', '3. Stevie repeatedly led the group with generic “focus on quiet vs. chatty” lines, steering conversation but never coming under fire herself, another hallmark of Mafia trying to shape discussion while avoiding suspicion.  \n', '4. The Mafia’s night kills hit the most vocal bystanders (Adrian, then Alex), removing strong analysts. In contrast, Stevie and Brook tuned down the heat on themselves, ensuring they survived.  \n', 'All together, their unchallenged voting records, steering-the-chat tactics, and absence of genuine scrutiny point to Stevie and Brook as the two Mafia.']

Game 0632, Day 3:
 Actual Mafia: River
Stevie 
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: Stevie, River  \n', 'Reason:  \n', '1) Vote‐pattern analysis  \n', '  - There were three “bad” daytime lynches (Elliot, Tyler, Ronny), all innocents.  Each time, Stevie and River voted with the majority to eliminate an innocent.  No honest player would consistently side with the wrong lynch at every opportunity.  \n', '  - In fact, after Day 1’s innocent lynch (Elliot), neither Stevie nor River voted; but on Day 2 (Tyler) and Day 3 (Ronny), both Stevie and River cast lynch votes against those innocents.  Such a perfect “track record” of bad votes marks them as the only players repeatedly guiding the group astray.  \n', '\n', '2) Deflection tactics  \n', '  - Throughout discussion, both Stevie and River repeatedly urged the table to “watch the quiet ones” or “look at who’s steering the conversation” without ever putting their own names in play.  That is classic mafia behavior: aggressively directing suspicion elsewhere while remaining unaccused.  \n', '\n', '3) Survival despite heavy group‐think  \n', '  - As bystanders were systematically eliminated (Adrian, Alex, Brook), Stevie and River went entirely unlynched—even as they continued directing and voting.  Their ability to fly under the radar amid so much chatter and to push false leads is a hallmark of the mafia.  \n', '\n', '4) Final endgame arithmetic  \n', '  - In the last lynch (voting out Ronny), Stevie and River again joined the majority against an innocent, cementing their pattern of misdirection.  With only four players left and two mafia remaining, the only consistent pair capable of orchestrating all three innocent lynches and surviving themselves is Stevie and River.']

Game 0633, Day 1:
 Actual Mafia: River
Stevie 
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: River, Whitney  \n', 'Reason:  \n', '1. At the very start of Day 1 River and Whitney posted near-identical “detective hat” messages in succession—an uncanny mirror that looks very much like pre-coordination.  \n', '2. Both repeatedly deflected suspicion onto the quieter players (Alex, Noah, Tyler) while keeping the focus off themselves. That’s a classic mafia tactic: steer the town’s attention elsewhere.  \n', '3. River never went along with the town’s lynch of Tyler (voting instead for Alex), sowing further confusion and mistrust among the bystanders.  \n', '4. Whitney, by contrast, dutifully voted with the majority on Tyler, giving the pair plausible deniability but also ensuring the town mis-lynched an innocent.  \n', '5. Their joint behavior—identical phrasing, parallel deflection tactics, and subtle vote-shading—points strongly to them being the two mafia members.']

Game 0633, Day 2:
 Actual Mafia: River
Stevie 
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: Alex, Brook  \n', 'Reason:  \n', '1) On Day 1 the group lynched Tyler (a bystander). The six players who voted Tyler were Whitney, Noah, Ronny, Elliot, Alex and Brook. Mafia want to eliminate bystanders, so both mafia would have been in that majority.  – Tyler’s voters set the first “suspect pool.”  \n', '2) On Day 2 the group lynched Whitney (another bystander). The four players who voted Whitney were Elliot, Stevie, Brook and Alex. Again, true mafia would side with the majority to kill a bystander.  – Whitney’s voters set the second “suspect pool.”  \n', '3) Taking the intersection of those two suspect pools leaves exactly three names (Elliot, Alex, Brook), and we must pick two.  \n', '4) Comparing their discussion styles, Brook and Alex consistently steered the group subtly without committing to strong accusations of each other (a classic mafia tactic), while Elliot was more willing to single out teammates.  \n', '5) Finally, the night kill of Noah (a bystander who had pressed for clarity on voting motives) aligns with a duo looking to silence someone probing too deeply—Brook and Alex had both encouraged broad, noncommittal discussion rather than detailed debate.  \n', 'Therefore, the two mafia are Alex and Brook.']

Game 0633, Day 3:
 Actual Mafia: River
Stevie 
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: River, Alex\n', '\n', 'Reason:  \n', '1. At the end only River, Alex, Stevie and Ronny remained, and two of those four had to be mafia.  \n', '2. River’s behavior was highly deflective and controlling throughout—repeating “let’s get those detective hats on” posts, steering discussion away from themselves, and notably refusing to vote with the majority on Day 1 (they voted for Alex instead of Tyler).  That “out of sync” vote strongly suggests a hidden agenda.  \n', '3. Alex also exhibited deflection and misdirection: early on they flagged the obvious chat-leaders (River/Whitney), then repeatedly urged group consensus, and slipped into minority votes (e.g. voting for River on Day 3) that helped eliminate bystanders.  \n', '4. In contrast, Ronny and Stevie maintained balanced, moderate questioning, chimed in less aggressively, and never drove the group toward innocents. Their votes followed sensible group logic rather than misdirection.  \n', '5. The night kills (Adrian, Noah, Brook) and day lynches (Tyler, Whitney, Elliot) all fell to bystanders—River and Alex’s consistent steering of suspicion onto others explains how the real mafia avoided detection.']

Game 0634, Day 1:
 Actual Mafia: River
Stevie 
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: Alex, Stevie  \n', 'Reason: Both Alex and Stevie conspicuously cast their day‐votes on Elliot, and Elliot was exactly the player killed that night—classic mafia framing. By jointly pushing for Elliot as “suspicious” in the vote and then eliminating him overnight, they shape the narrative to make their accusation look prescient and deflect attention from themselves. No other pair’s voting pattern so neatly matches the nighttime kill, marking Alex and Stevie as the two mafia.']

Game 0634, Day 2:
 Actual Mafia: River
Stevie 
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: Alex, Stevie  \n', 'Reason:  \n', '1) After Day 1 everyone mass-lynched Tyler—an innocent—and the two who held off the bandwagon were Noah and River (they never wavered), so neither of them is mafia.  \n', '2) On Day 2 the group suddenly zeroed in on Whitney with almost no solid evidence. The only two people who never joined that rush were Brook (who voted against River instead) and Whitney herself (forced by the game to vote for River). Brook’s one “against-the-crowd” vote saved her from suspicion—typical villager behavior—while Whitney was an innocent scapegoat.  \n', '3) The two strongest drivers of those wild swings in both phases were Alex and Stevie. They dominated the conversation, repeatedly steering suspicion onto innocents (Tyler first, then Whitney) without ever offering weighty proofs, and they were quick to follow up with broad “look-at-everyone-else” misdirection.  \n', '4) Immediately after Whitney’s lynch, the mafia killed Adrian—another solid, inquisitive bystander who had been pressing for real clues. Silencing Adrian was a classic mafia move to muzzle the one person most actively narrowing in on suspects.  \n', '5) Of the surviving six (Alex, Brook, Noah, River, Ronny, Stevie) the only two whose patterns match that of mafia ham-fistedly driving innocent deaths are Alex and Stevie.  \n', 'Together, Alex and Stevie account for all three foul eliminations of pure bystanders (Day 1: Tyler, Night 1: Elliot, Day 2: Whitney, Night 2: Adrian) by misdirection and murder, marking them as the mafia.']

Game 0634, Day 3:
 Actual Mafia: River
Stevie 
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: Alex, Stevie  \n', 'Reason:  \n', '1. Kill pattern analysis: the mafia systematically eliminated the most analytical, pattern‐spotting players (Elliot, Adrian, Brook by night; Whitney by lynch), leaving behind players who were less inclined to dig into behaviors or who led discussions in broad, non\xadspecific ways.  \n', '2. Alex’s behavior: he consistently steered every conversation, offered high\xadlevel “detective” guidance but rarely pinned down specifics, and deflected direct suspicion—classic mafia leadership.  \n', '3. Stevie’s behavior: she was enthusiastic, supportive of vague theories, and pushed the group to follow her suggestions without offering concrete evidence or self\xadcritique, a common mafia tactic to blend in while controlling the narrative.  \n', '4. Voting and survival: both Alex and Stevie avoided drawing lethal suspicion, surviving every vote and never being close to lynch despite their heavy involvement, whereas true bystanders were repeatedly targeted and removed.  \n', '5. Remaining survivors: the final four were Alex, Noah, River, and Stevie; Alex and Stevie fit the profile of enduring manipulators, making them the remaining two mafia.']

Game 0635, Day 1:
 Actual Mafia: River
Stevie 
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: Stevie, Tyler  \n', 'Reason: On Day 1 they were the only two who voted together to lynch Alex (an innocent) and avoided ever voting for one another—classic mafia behavior to bandwagon an innocent while staying “clean.” Their overly eager, steering tone in the chat (pushing theories without substance) further matches how mafia often try to direct suspicion away from themselves.']

Game 0635, Day 2:
 Actual Mafia: River
Stevie 
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: River, Tyler  \n', 'Reason:  \n', '1) On Day 1, River and one other player conspicuously both voted to lynch Alex—despite Alex being innocent. That pair voting together looked like a coordinated mafia hit. Tyler was one of the three who band-wagoned Alex alongside River.  \n', '2) Throughout Day 2, Tyler repeatedly and insistently steered suspicion away from himself—first highlighting others as “too quiet” or “too eager,” then pushing the focus onto Stevie, Brook, Adrian, etc.—classic mafia deflection.  \n', '3) When River’s guilt finally became obvious, Tyler never shifted blame onto the true culprits; instead he kept casting votes for bystanders (first Brook, then deflecting onto others) rather than admitting he’d been voting in sync with River.  \n', '4) At Night 2 the remaining mafia killed Whitney, who had been one of the sharpest voices pressing us to re‐examine voting patterns—another sign that the killer feared she’d uncover the other mafia.  \n', 'All together, River’s vote‐pairing with Tyler and Tyler’s pattern of deflection point to Tyler as the second mafia.']

Game 0635, Day 3:
 Actual Mafia: River
Stevie 
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: River, Stevie\n', '\n', 'Reason:\n', '1. Day 1 voting patterns looked random and unfocused, but River repeatedly tried to steer suspicion onto quiet players while deflecting any direct scrutiny from themselves.  \n', '2. River’s over-eagerness to push the discussion forward and their repeated calls to watch “those who stay too quiet” were classic mafia attempts to frame bystanders and avoid attention.  \n', '3. At the end of Day 2, the group voted out River, who proved to be mafia.  \n', '4. During the subsequent night, the remaining mafia killed Whitney, further thinning the bystander ranks.  \n', '5. On Day 3, all eyes turned to those who had been most active in guiding the discussion. Stevie’s pattern of volunteering theories, calling out others, and then quickly shifting the narrative made them stand out as the only remaining mafia.  \n', '6. The group correctly voted Stevie out on the final day, confirming them as the second mafia.']

Game 0636, Day 1:
 Actual Mafia: River
Stevie 
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: Alex, River  \n', 'Reason:  \n', '1. After Whitney’s lynch, four players broke from the majority block (Alex, River, Brook, Ronny) by voting in different directions rather than banding together. Mafia often scatter their votes to avoid obvious pairing in a large bloc.  \n', '2. Among those four, Brook and Ronny both offered detailed strategic input (echoing patterns, watching contradictions) that reads more like town play—building frameworks for future reads. Alex and River, by contrast, stuck to lightweight, boilerplate intros and then each cast an isolated vote (Alex→Brook, River→Noah), seeding confusion rather than adding real structure.  \n', '3. Neither Alex nor River voted for each other, fitting how two mafia avoid directly targeting a partner, while still refusing to follow the town’s majority.  \n', '4. The night kill (Adrian) was a bystander who had been vocal about watching “eager accusers” (a warning to town), so the mafia silenced a potential threat. Alex and River’s low‐information posts make it likely they were managing their appearances to fly under the radar.  \n', '5. No other pair matches both the voting nonconformity and the shallow chat posture as cleanly as Alex & River.']

Game 0636, Day 2:
 Actual Mafia: River
Stevie 
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: River, Brook  \n', 'Reason: Looking at Day 2’s voting, the only two votes on Alex came from River and Brook—strongly suggesting they were secretly aligned. River (a mafia) cast his vote for Alex to deflect suspicion, and Brook joined him in that deflection. In contrast, all the genuine bystanders (Alex, Elliot, Noah, Ronny) correctly voted for River. On Day 1, Brook also voted for River (a clean play to avoid looking too coordinated), then switched allegiance on Day 2 to mirror River’s target. That vote alignment pattern—random on Day 1, perfectly matching River on Day 2—marks Brook as the second mafia alongside River.']

Game 0636, Day 3:
 Actual Mafia: River
Stevie 
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: River, Noah  \n', 'Reason:  \n', '1. River was revealed as mafia when voted out on Day 2.  \n', '2. After River’s exit, only one mafia remained to kill at night. That killer was responsible for Tyler’s death on Night 2 and Ronny’s death on Night 3.  \n', '3. On the final day, votes split between Alex and Stevie (2 votes each), Brook received 1 vote, and Noah received 0 votes—no one suspected Noah.  \n', '4. The surviving mafia would steer clear of suspicion and avoid any votes; Noah never received a vote in the last round.  \n', '5. Noah’s clean slate at the end and ability to fly under the radar match the behavior of the remaining mafia.  \n', '6. Therefore, the two mafia were River and Noah.']

Game 0636, Day 4:
 Actual Mafia: River
Stevie 
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: River, Stevie\n', '\n', 'Reason:\n', '1. There were two mafia and they kill one bystander each night.  \n', '2. Night 1 kill was Adrian (bystander), so neither mafia was killed.  \n', '3. Day 2 the group voted out River, who was revealed as mafia.  \n', '4. Night 2 kill was Tyler (bystander), leaving one mafia alive.  \n', '5. Day 3 the group voted out Alex (bystander).  \n', '6. Night 3 kill was Ronny (bystander), again leaving one mafia.  \n', '7. Day 4 the final vote ejected Stevie, who was revealed as the second mafia.  \n', '8. With River and Stevie both outed as mafia, there were no mafia remaining.']

Game 0637, Day 1:
 Actual Mafia: River
Stevie 
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: River\n', '\n', 'Reason:\n', '1. Two mafia vote patterns often align—during the day Stevie (mafia) and River were the only ones to vote for Noah.  \n', '2. That night the mafia killed Noah, exactly matching the pair’s voting target.  \n', '3. River’s dialogue was highly repetitive and echo-heavy, repeatedly deflecting to others and never introducing unique analysis.  \n', '4. River also steered suspicion onto others (Tyler, Stevie, etc.), then suddenly pivoted to Noah at vote time—classic mafia misdirection.  \n', '5. No one else voted for Noah besides Stevie and River, so River must be the surviving mafia.']

Game 0637, Day 2:
 Actual Mafia: River
Stevie 
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: Stevie, River\n', '\n', 'Reason:  \n', '1. In the first daytime, players focused on “echoing” and steering tactics. Stevie was notably vocal in trying to deflect attention onto others (especially Noah) and repeatedly suggested group‐think strategies without offering unique analysis.  \n', '2. The voting split 5–3 in that round (Adrian, Whitney, Elliot, Alex, Brook all voted Stevie), and Stevie was lynched—his role revealed as mafia.  \n', '3. That night the mafia killed Noah (an innocent), confirming there was still one mafia left.  \n', '4. In the second daytime, River’s vote for Noah—who had just been confirmed innocent—stood out as a misdirected move. Multiple players picked up on her echoing and deflection patterns.  \n', '5. The second vote went heavily for River (6 of 8 votes), and she was lynched and revealed as the remaining mafia.  \n', '6. Thus the two mafia in the game were Stevie and River.']

Game 0638, Day 1:
 Actual Mafia: River
Stevie 
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: Tyler, Brook  \n', 'Reason:  \n', '1) Night kill target (Noah) had voted for Tyler—classic mafia move is to eliminate players who suspect them.  \n', '2) Tyler repeatedly steered the conversation (“let’s each share gut feelings,” “anyone else flying under the radar?”) in a way that felt more about controlling than honestly detecting.  \n', '3) When Alex flagged “echoing” from Ronny and Brook, Brook instantly pivoted the suspicion onto Tyler and kept deflecting back to group behaviour rather than addressing the point—textbook mafia deflection.  \n', '4) Both Tyler and Brook were unusually quick to call for everyone else to speak first, avoiding real substance themselves while guiding votes.  \n', '5) Their combined behaviour—guiding the narrative, deflecting direct scrutiny, and benefiting from the kill and lynch outcomes—marks them as the two mafia.']

Game 0638, Day 2:
 Actual Mafia: River
Stevie 
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: Brook, Ronny  \n', 'Reason:  \n', '1) After Day 1’s lynch of Elliot (an innocent), the two eventual night-kills were Noah and then Adrian—both of whom had been most vocal about or most consistently pointing at the same two players: Brook and Ronny. Mafia typically eliminate the players closing in on them.  \n', '2) On Day 1, Adrian explicitly flagged Brook (and to a lesser extent Ronny) for “echoing without adding” and being overly agreeable, and Ronny repeatedly called out subtler steering by Tyler—signals that Brook/Ronny were the prime targets of suspicion. That very night, Noah (another strong analyst) was killed.  \n', '3) On Day 2, the discussion once again circled around repetition and subtle guidance. Those same two names never came under sustained scrutiny by the group, yet they steered the conversation toward others (first Tyler, then Elliot) who were then lynched.  \n', '4) Finally, Adrian—who singled out Brook and Ronny—was murdered in Night 2. The mafia’s night-kills match exactly those players who had homed in on Brook/Ronny.  \n', '5) Taken together—the pattern of misdirection on Day and the choice of Night kills—it points squarely at Brook and Ronny as the two mafia.']

Game 0638, Day 3:
 Actual Mafia: River
Stevie 
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: River, Brook  \n', '\n', 'Reason:  \n', '1. River is confirmed mafia (lynched Day 3 with “was mafia” tag).  \n', '2. Looking at who drove early lynches of bystanders: River and Brook were among the small core pushing Elliot out Day 1.  \n', '3. Throughout the game Brook remained unusually “active but low-scrutiny,” echoing others just enough to blend in—classic mafia behavior.  \n', '4. On Day 3, Whitney explicitly called out “brook and river” as suspicious; that very night the mafia killed Whitney, showing Brook and River were the targets she’d named.  \n', '5. With River dead at the end of Day 3 and Brook escaping suspicion, Brook must be the remaining mafia partner.']

Game 0638, Day 4:
 Actual Mafia: River
Stevie 
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: River, Stevie  \n', 'Reason:  \n', '1. Two mafia kill each night; the nighttime victims (Noah, Adrian, Whitney, Alex) were all bystanders.  \n', '2. River was lynched on Day 3 and revealed as mafia.  \n', '3. Stevie was never revealed as a bystander and survived every lynch until the final “mafia=1 bystander=1” endgame.  \n', '4. No other player fits the pattern of nightly kills and surviving the lynches. Therefore the mafia pair was River and Stevie.']

Game 0639, Day 1:
 Actual Mafia: River
Stevie 
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: Whitney,River  \n', 'Reason: Both Whitney and River were the earliest and most insistent voices pushing the town to lynch Adrian—first Whitney singled out Adrian, then River immediately doubled down—steering everyone toward an innocent. Their strong, coordinated calls to focus on “neutral” behavior and to herd votes onto Adrian laid the ground for a unanimous lynch. That level of guiding the mob and deflection is classic mafia play, and afterward Noah (a genuine townie) was picked off at night, consistent with Whitney and River being the hidden killers.']

Game 0639, Day 2:
 Actual Mafia: River
Stevie 
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: River, Brook  \n', 'Reason:  \n', '1) Vote‐patterns on Day 2 strongly point to River as mafia. Tyler and Ronny both cast for River; Tyler was then killed that night—mafia often eliminate villagers who vote for them.  \n', '2) On both days Brook consistently led and deflected suspicion onto others (first River/Adrian, then River/Whitney), yet never drew serious heat themselves—classic mafia steering.  \n', '3) Brook and River both voted together to lynch two innocent bystanders (Adrian Day 1, Whitney Day 2), while avoiding voting for each other.  \n', '4) Post‐lynch night kills matched Day 2 voters against River (Tyler) and Day 1’s lead critics, further implicating Brook/River coordination.  \n', '5) All other players either voted against River (and survived) or were themselves lynched/killed as bystanders.  \n', 'Taken together, the surviving duo consistently manipulated discussion and protected each other, marking Brook and River as the two mafia.']

Game 0639, Day 3:
 Actual Mafia: River
Stevie 
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: River, Stevie  \n', 'Reason:  \n', '1. Two mafia remain after Adrian was incorrectly lynched and then River was voted out as mafia.  \n', '2. In the final daytime vote, River (a mafia) and one other player did not vote for River.  \n', '3. All other players (Alex, Elliot, Ronny, Brook) cast their votes against River. Only Stevie voted for Elliot, avoiding River.  \n', '4. Mafia never vote for their own partner. Since River and Stevie were the only two who didn’t vote against River, they are the mafia pair.']

Game 0639, Day 4:
 Actual Mafia: River
Stevie 
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: River, Alex  \n', 'Reason:  \n', '1.  Two mafia total; River was exposed on Day 3.  \n', '2.  After River’s lynch and the subsequent night kill of Elliot, the remaining four (Brook, Stevie, Alex, Ronny) zeroed in on subtle steering and “middle-of-the-road” behavior as mafia tells.  \n', '3.  In that final four discussion, Brook, Ronny, and even Stevie were all explicitly grilled and voted on—but Alex was never really under fire or voted for.  \n', '4.  When Brook was lynched, the single surviving mafia then killed Ronny by night, leaving Alex and Stevie.  \n', '5.  The only player never genuinely suspected (and who both guided suspicions elsewhere and escaped any votes) is Alex.  \n', '6.  Therefore the two mafia are River and Alex.']

Game 0640, Day 1:
 Actual Mafia: River
Stevie 
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: Alex, Elliot  \n', 'Reason:  \n', '1. After Tyler (an innocent) was lynched, only Alex and Elliot received zero votes during Day 1—everyone else drew at least some suspicion. In social-deduction logic, mafia tend to steer clear of direct suspicion so bystanders overlook them.  \n', '2. Throughout the long discussion, Alex and Elliot both contributed “helpful” meta-analysis without ever strongly accusing anyone or putting themselves in the hot seat—another common mafia tactic to stay under the radar.  \n', '3. All other players were at least hinted at or voted for once, whereas Alex and Elliot managed to avoid a single vote against them. That consistent absence of suspicion points to them as the hidden mafia.']

Game 0640, Day 2:
 Actual Mafia: River
Stevie 
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: Alex, Elliot  \n', 'Reason:  \n', '1) Both Alex and Elliot were central to steering lynches toward bystanders (Tyler on Day 1 and Brook on Day 2) without ever drawing meaningful scrutiny themselves.  \n', '2) They repeatedly pushed specific players into the spotlight—Alex by targeting Brook heavily in both the questioning and the vote, and Elliot by echoing that line of attack—despite Brook being a bystander both times.  \n', '3) Neither ever genuinely answered direct probes about their own read on suspicious behavior; instead they redirected the conversation outward, a classic deflection tactic.  \n', '4) Their voting record shows they consistently joined the majority to eliminate innocents, giving them cover and the opportunity to manipulate the group’s suspicions.  \n', 'Taken together, these patterns point squarely at Alex and Elliot as the two hidden mafia.']

Game 0640, Day 3:
 Actual Mafia: River
Stevie 
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: River, Stevie\n', '\n', 'Reason:  \n', '1. Review of kill and lynch history shows the mafia consistently target the most active, initiative-taking bystanders (Whitney, Adrian, Noah), leaving behind those who primarily echo and ask questions rather than stake out concrete accusations.  \n', '2. Many players contributed specific theories or pointed to particular behavioral patterns. Alex, Ronny and others suggested definite tell-tales (e.g. quick agreements, steering debates) and were themselves later lynched or killed as bystanders. In contrast River and Stevie continually kept the conversation going with open-ended prompts but never committed to accusing anyone or putting a name on the table.  \n', '3. River and Stevie’s dialogue is largely generic (“let’s ask subtle questions,” “keep an eye on steering/echo patterns,” “anyone notice anything odd?”) rather than targeted analysis. That pattern fits a mafia strategy of blending in by seeming helpful without ever exposing themselves.  \n', '4. In each round, when pressed for specifics, both River and Stevie deflected by asking others to speak, while the genuine bystanders supplied substantive leads—and then became mafia night targets.  \n', '5. Finally, both remaining bystanders (Alex and Ronny) had offered detailed observations and never got killed at night, consistent with mafia preserving fellow rouges (River and Stevie).  \n', '\n', 'Together, these factors point to River and Stevie as the two hidden mafia.']

Game 0641, Day 1:
 Actual Mafia: River
Stevie 
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: Ronny, River  \n', 'Reason:  \n', '1) Vote alignment – Ronny and River were the only two who broke from the group in the final vote and cast their ballots for Alex, while everyone else united on Whitney. Such a paired divergence suggests coordination.  \n', '2) Forced framing – Both repeatedly steered suspicion toward Alex, pressing others for “gut feelings” about him without offering substantive evidence themselves. That looks like an attempt to frame an innocent.  \n', '3) Conversation control – They led calls for roll-calls and kept redirecting the discussion to “quiet vs. chatty” patterns, a classic ploy to flush out genuine bystanders rather than surface their own tells.  \n', '4) Deflecting specifics – Neither ever made a concrete accusation backed by observations, instead peppering questions at others to stay on the defense.  \n', '5) Night kill logic – Killing Elliot, a highly vocal bystander, fits the mob’s aim of silencing a talkative innocent rather than targeting someone who had suspected them.  \n', 'All together, Ronny and River’s mirrored voting behavior, push to frame Alex, and deflective tactics mark them as the two mafia.']

Game 0641, Day 2:
 Actual Mafia: River
Stevie 
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: Alex,River  \n', '\n', 'Reason:  \n', '1. Vote‐patterns point at them. On Day 1 everyone but River (and Ronny) voted out Whitney – River’s lone dissent suggests a misdirection play. On Day 2 River flipped to vote with the majority (for Ronny), a classic mafia tactic to burn any immediate suspicion.  \n', '2. Alex was the only player to draw votes both Day 1 (2 votes for Alex) and Day 2 (3 votes), yet repeatedly steered the conversation away from himself, proposing broad “who’s been too quiet/chatty” lines without offering concrete reads. That deflection is typical of mafia.  \n', '3. River’s posts were similarly vague and often mirrored others’ points (e.g. “look for inconsistencies,” “quiet vs. chatty”), without pushing any real analysis – another hallmark of mafia keeping a low analytic profile.  \n', '4. The real detectives (Adrian, Brook, Tyler, Stevie) all offered specific patterns to watch or questioned vote‐motives; Alex and River stuck to general appeals and meta‐talk, letting the group do the heavy lifting.  \n', '5. Both Elliot and Noah – two of the round’s sharper active contributors – were killed by night, implying the killers were monitoring who drove the discussion. Alex and River consistently shadowed that scrutiny rather than owning it.  \n', '\n', 'Taken together, Alex and River’s voting behavior, repeated narrative deflections, and reluctance to commit to detailed suspicions mark them as the two mafia.']

Game 0641, Day 3:
 Actual Mafia: River
Stevie 
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: Brook, Tyler  \n', 'Reason:  \n', '1) After each lynch and night‐kill, the real mafia steered suspicion onto other outspoken players, especially Alex, by repeatedly seeding the idea that “anyone neatly echoing Alex’s lead must be suspect.”  \n', '2) The first such pivot came from Tyler (“anyone echoing Alex’s strategies too seamlessly…”) and was immediately backed up by Brook. That coordinated deflection reappeared in the final day’s round of “who’s just aligning with Alex to stay under the radar” accusations—exactly the sort of subtle misdirection mafia use to avert attention from themselves.  \n', '3) Neither Tyler nor Brook ever genuinely wavered in voting Alex regardless of real evidence, whereas the others offered a greater variety of theories and never drove the “alignment” storyline as tightly.  \n', '4) Both Tyler and Brook also pushed for roll calls or blanket “quiet vs. chatty” tests—classic mafia behavior to flush out or herd bystanders rather than zero in on real slip-ups.  \n', 'All told, Tyler and Brook displayed a level of tandem steering and false-clue–planting that matches mafia play.']

Game 0642, Day 1:
 Actual Mafia: River
Stevie 
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: River, Alex  \n', 'Reason:  \n', '1) River was the first to single out Adrian with no concrete evidence, steering the group’s focus.  \n', '2) River also cast the lone vote on Elliot rather than joining the majority, a classic mafia move to sow confusion.  \n', '3) Alex repeatedly echoed River’s framing of Adrian, naming him specifically over and over, instead of offering neutral observations.  \n', '4) Both then blended back in with the crowd on the final vote, voting Adrian to conceal their own alignment.  \n', '5) Tyler’s night kill of a vocal bystander fits a mafia looking to silence active players after successfully mislynching Adrian.  \n', 'Together, River and Alex’s patterns of targeted accusations and split-voting align with mafia behavior.']

Game 0642, Day 2:
 Actual Mafia: River
Stevie 
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: River, Brook  \n', 'Reason:  \n', '1. River was the lynched player on Day 2 and revealed as mafia.  \n', '2. After losing two bystanders (Adrian then Tyler), the group immediately ganged up on River. While everyone piled on, Brook was the first non‐River survivor to single River out by name (00:43:03), repeatedly drove the “let’s focus on River” narrative, and offered no concrete evidence—just generic calls to watch “quiet players” or “echoers.”  \n', '3. That fits a mafia play: once one mafia (River) was identified, the partner (Brook) steered suspicion there to protect themselves, then quietly slipped under the radar.  \n', '4. Finally, the night kill targeted Noah—the most vocal bystander—showing the remaining mafia (Brook) was eliminating the biggest threat.  \n', 'Together, these points identify River and Brook as the two mafia.']

Game 0642, Day 3:
 Actual Mafia: River
Stevie 
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: River,Stevie\n', '\n', 'Reason:\n', '1. Two mafia start in the game, and by Day 1 the group mislynched Adrian (a bystander) and then the mafia killed Tyler at night.\n', '2. In Day 2’s discussion, many flagged players who “echoed” others’ points and steered conversation subtly. River was especially active but added no real new insights, often redirecting focus when pressed. The group ultimately voted out River, who proved to be mafia.\n', '3. That night the remaining mafia killed Noah (another bystander), confirming one mafia still remained.\n', '4. In the final Day, the same echoing/steering behavior patterns surfaced in Stevie’s posts—mirroring others’ ideas, staying just under suspicion, and guiding discussions at key moments—leading the group to vote Stevie out. Stevie’s role then revealed as the second mafia.\n', '5. With River and Stevie both exposed, all mafia are accounted for.']

Game 0643, Day 1:
 Actual Mafia: River
Stevie 
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: River, Tyler  \n', '\n', 'Reason:  \n', '1. River’s behavior was the classic “echo-and-deflect” style: they repeatedly agreed with others’ points without adding any original observations, consistently urged the group to hear from quieter players, and dodged offering concrete suspicions—exactly how River operated and was correctly lynched as mafia.  \n', '2. Tyler displayed very similar patterns of deflection and scapegoating throughout Day 1. He repeatedly zeroed in on “quiet” players (especially Noah and Whitney), urged the group to shine the spotlight on them, and kept deflecting attention away from himself by pushing for consensus votes against innocents.  \n', '3. Tyler never proposed a solid suspect of his own, instead echoing the group’s concerns and redirecting them onto those least likely to fight back—another strong indicator of mafia play.  \n', '4. Since mafia commonly operate in tandem—one playing the overt echo/deflect role (River) and the other subtly steering suspicion onto innocents (Tyler)—the remaining mafia must be Tyler.']

Game 0643, Day 2:
 Actual Mafia: River
Stevie 
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: River, Adrian\n', '\n', 'Reason:  \n', '1. Day 1 the group voted out River and he turned out to be mafia. That leaves one mafia still alive.  \n', '2. On Day 2, nearly everyone offered reasonable, balanced suggestions—watching who’s too quiet or too chatty—but one player in particular, Adrian, kept driving suspicion onto Ronny.  \n', '3. Adrian repeatedly interjected to ask why “Stevie voted Ronny,” to highlight Ronny’s “active” behavior, and to press everyone to reevaluate Ronny’s comments. That sustained focus on an innocent is a classic mafia tactic to deflect suspicion from themselves.  \n', '4. After the group lynched Ronny (an innocent), the mafia killed Elliot that night—silencing a moderately vocal player—rather than targeting the more aggressive question-askers or quieter players.  \n', '5. Adrian’s steering of the lynch and the post-lynch kill pattern match the behavior of the remaining mafia. Hence, the surviving mafia are River and Adrian.']

Game 0643, Day 3:
 Actual Mafia: River
Stevie 
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: River, Brook  \n', 'Reason:  \n', '1) In the very first lynch River cast the lone dissenting vote (voting Noah) while everyone else voted River. That “single‐vote” pattern is exactly what the real mafia do to avoid drawing the majority’s ire. River was confirmed mafia when lynched.  \n', '2) Brook mirrors those same mafia voting tactics in later rounds: they never lead with real evidence, they consistently echo whatever suspicion others raise, and they’re quick to zero in on a scapegoat (e.g. Tyler) without offering any concrete reads of their own. Brook’s habit of deflecting and blending in—rather than engaging on specifics—matches the divergence‐vote signature we saw from River.  \n', '3) Brook also never gets targeted in discussion but is always steering the group’s focus onto quieter or too‐vocal players. That level of “helpful” steering and constant consensus‐driving is classic mafia behavior.  \n', 'Putting those pieces together, the two players who used minority (“divergent”) voting to protect themselves and repeatedly deflected suspicion onto others are River and Brook.']

Game 0643, Day 4:
 Actual Mafia: River
Stevie 
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: River, Stevie  \n', 'Reason:  \n', '1. Two mafia start the game.  \n', '2. On Day 1, River was unanimously voted out and revealed as mafia.  \n', '3. After River’s elimination, only one mafia remained alive.  \n', '4. That single mafia then killed Whitney, Elliot, Adrian, and Noah in successive nights—all confirmed bystanders.  \n', '5. Throughout the game Stevie was never convincingly accused or eliminated and continued participating until the end.  \n', '6. The remaining player who consistently avoided detection and carried out the kills must be the second mafia: Stevie.']

Game 0644, Day 1:
 Actual Mafia: River
Stevie 
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: Brook, Tyler  \n', 'Reason: Throughout the day both Brook and Tyler repeatedly chimed in with nearly identical phrasing and timing—raising the classic “echo” red flag for collusion. They were by far the most active pair steering everyone’s attention onto quieter players, deflecting suspicion from themselves. After the lynch of Ronny (a bystander) and the night‐kill of Alex (also a bystander), the only two unaccounted‐for suspicious voices who worked in lockstep are Brook and Tyler—making them the two mafia.']

Game 0644, Day 2:
 Actual Mafia: River
Stevie 
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: Adrian, River\n', '\n', 'Reason:  \n', '1) Adrian’s behaviour throughout the dialogue is highly manipulative—first pushing the “quiet‐player” line, then repeatedly switching to the “echo‐pattern” theory, always steering the group away from any consistent suspects. That level of agenda‐setting is classic mafia misdirection.  \n', '2) River likewise plays the role of the constructive moderator but never lands on a concrete target, constantly suggesting new angles (“quiet vs. echo” vs. “who’s guiding the conversation”) and deflecting the spotlight away from themselves.  \n', '3) The night murders (first Alex, then Brook) removed two of the few people who were actually sniffing out false leads, which aligns with River and Adrian’s pattern of keeping real suspicion off themselves.  \n', '4) No other players showed comparable levels of strategic misdirection or agenda‐setting, marking Adrian and River as the two hidden mafia.']

Game 0644, Day 3:
 Actual Mafia: River
Stevie 
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: Elliot, Stevie  \n', 'Reason: Both Elliot and Stevie consistently steered the discussion away from themselves and onto innocent bystanders, then voted in lockstep to eliminate town.  \n', '1) Elliot’s big tell came late in Day 3, when he suddenly “remembered” that Adrian and Stevie had been under suspicion “all along” even though no one else had named them prior. That felt like a false‐flag move to drag the town onto two clean players.  \n', '2) Stevie never really put forward any fresh reads of her own—just echoed Elliot’s calls to “focus on whoever’s subtly steering conversations” (i.e. anyone but her or Elliot).  \n', '3) Night kills tracked perfectly with mafia self‐preservation: Noah had just voted for Stevie, and the very next night he was killed. That’s exactly what two guilty players would do.  \n', '4) The only two people who never got lynched or killed were Elliot and Stevie, and their synchronized misdirection fits the profile of the remaining mafia duo.']

Game 0645, Day 1:
 Actual Mafia: River
Stevie 
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: River, Ronny\n', '\n', 'Reason:\n', '1. Voting & Kill Patterns  \n', '   - During the day, River drew heavy suspicion (4 votes) yet survived, while Whitney (also 4 votes) was lynched.  \n', '   - That night the mafia killed Elliot—one of River’s voters—consistent with mafia targeting someone who threatened them by voting River.  \n', '2. Mutual Non‐Accusation  \n', '   - River and Ronny never accused or voted for each other, making them unlikely to suspect one another if they were teammates.  \n', '3. Suspicion Footprint  \n', '   - River was a focal point of suspicion and then deflected vote to Alex, a common mafia tactic to diffuse blame.  \n', '   - Ronny, by contrast, flew entirely under the radar—never seriously mentioned in “who do you suspect” discussion—typical mafia behavior to avoid drawing attention.  \n', '4. Partner Logic  \n', '   - River’s strongest threat (Elliot) was killed at night, indicating River’s involvement in mafia decisions.  \n', '   - Among those who didn’t vote for River (and thus might form the mafia pair), Ronny is the only player who remained virtually unmentioned in suspicion debates.  \n', 'Together these clues point to River and Ronny as the two mafia.']

Game 0645, Day 2:
 Actual Mafia: River
Stevie 
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: River, Stevie  \n', 'Reason:  \n', '1. Two mafia started the game. River was exposed and lynched on Day 2, so their partner must still be alive.  \n', '2. At the Day 2 vote (after Elliot’s nighttime kill), River (mafia) drew five votes, and everyone except one player voted correctly to eliminate River. The lone holdout was Stevie, who voted for Alex instead.  \n', '3. Mafia will avoid voting for their partner. Stevie’s vote pattern matches that of a hidden mafia—deflecting vote away from River rather than siding with the majority.  \n', '4. Throughout the discussions, Stevie repeatedly offered broad, noncommittal analysis (“let’s keep an eye on quiet vs. vocal players,” “who quickly agrees without adding new ideas?”) and steered suspicion onto others without presenting concrete evidence, a common mafia tactic to blend in.  \n', '5. After River’s removal, the next night kill was Adrian (a bystander), consistent with a single remaining mafia (Stevie) targeting a vocal bystander.  \n', '6. No other surviving player exhibited both the vote behavior and the subtle deflection patterns expected of mafia.  \n', 'Therefore, the two mafia were River and Stevie.']

Game 0645, Day 3:
 Actual Mafia: River
Stevie 
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: River, Brook  \n', 'Reason:  \n', '1) We know River was revealed as mafia when lynched on Day 2. The only other mafia member must be one of the survivors: Brook, Noah, Stevie or Tyler.  \n', '2) The second mafia survived every lynch and every night kill, so they successfully deflected suspicion at each vote.  \n', '3) Brook’s play‐style stands out: she was unusually supportive and chatty yet rarely offered concrete reasoning or novel deductions—classic “agreement fluff” to lower suspicion.  \n', '4) The group never seriously suspected Brook, even though they explicitly discussed patterns of deflecting and “agreeing too quickly” that matched her style.  \n', '5) By contrast, the other survivors (Noah, Stevie, Tyler) contributed more targeted analysis and were at least discussed as potential suspects at various points.  \n', '6) Only Brook remained entirely off the radar while proven mafia (River) was exposed—strong indication they were the hidden partner.']

Game 0645, Day 4:
 Actual Mafia: River
Stevie 
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: Tyler\n', '\n', 'Reason:\n', '1. Only two players survive the final night (Stevie and Tyler), and one of them must be the lone mafia.  \n', '2. Mafia players in this game consistently flew under the radar and deflected attention onto others rather than themselves. Tyler’s playstyle fits that pattern: he contributed reasonable suggestions but rarely drew direct suspicion or pushed new theories of his own.  \n', '3. In contrast, Stevie was openly analytical—she repeatedly asked probing questions and volunteered observations about behavior shifts. That proactive, transparent style is more typical of bystanders trying to root out mafia.  \n', '4. In the last night kill, the mafia targeted Noah (a suspected bystander) to reduce the town down to just the final two. Tyler, as the surviving mafia, would eliminate the only remaining bystander.  \n', '5. Throughout voting, Tyler never became a major target, whereas others like Stevie were often in the mix of discussion and voting. That lack of suspicion is characteristic of mafia successfully hiding in plain sight.  \n', '6. Putting this together—his low-profile, minimal self-steering, and the pattern of deflecting attention—shows that Tyler must be the final mafia member.']

Game 0646, Day 1:
 Actual Mafia: River
Stevie 
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: Alex, Stevie  \n', 'Reason: During Day 1, Adrian specifically pointed to Alex and Stevie as suspects—urging the group to watch for someone “steering the convo back to the same topics” and naming Alex and Stevie as prime examples. That got Adrian killed that very night, a classic mafia move to eliminate the player who’d zeroed in on them. Moreover, both Alex and Stevie consistently steered conversation without offering fresh analysis and conveniently voted for known bystanders (Alex for Ronny, Stevie for Whitney), helping them fly under the radar.']

Game 0646, Day 2:
 Actual Mafia: River
Stevie 
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: Elliot, Brook\n', '\n', 'Reason:  \n', '1. Early voting behavior was telling. On Day 1, only three players consistently drove the lynch—Elliot, Brook, and Alex—by pushing to vote Ronny while the rest of the table went after Whitney. Alex turned out to be a bystander (he was later killed at night), so the two survivors who led that mislynch are prime suspects.  \n', '2. Throughout both days, Elliot and Brook repeatedly steered discussion toward their chosen scapegoat (first Ronny, then again Ronny) without offering fresh, concrete evidence—classic misdirection.  \n', '3. They were the only two alive players who voted Ronny both Day 1 and Day 2 and who otherwise produced lots of talk but little actionable insight. Innocents tended to join the majority or ask for real clues; Elliot and Brook were the consistent outliers.  \n', '4. None of the other survivors (Stevie, Tyler, River, Noah) consistently led wrongful lynches or pressed the same target. Their votes and suspicions shifted more naturally as new information came to light.  \n', '5. By process of elimination and by examining who most aggressively and persistently misdirected the group toward innocent targets, Elliot and Brook fit the profile of the two hidden mafia.']

Game 0646, Day 3:
 Actual Mafia: River
Stevie 
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: Brook, River\n', '\n', 'Reason:  \n', '1. Looking at the endgame, the group was repeatedly encouraged to “watch Brook or Noah (and others) for quietly steering the conversation.” Immediately after that, the town lynched Elliot instead, and then the mafia killed Noah that night—exactly the bystander who had been most vocal about suspecting Brook. Keeping Brook alive in the face of mounting suspicion while killing off the player pointing at them is a textbook mafia move.  \n', '2. River’s own posts show tell-tale self‐defensive phrasing (“my increased participation is just enthusiasm,” “I can explain why I’ve been more active”), which is a common tactic to deflect attention.  \n', '3. Neither Brook nor River ever really offered concrete reads on others; instead they led the discussion in circles, echoing the town’s theories and then steering the group away from themselves. All the heavy mislynches (Whitney, Ronny, Elliot) and night kills (Adrian, Alex, Noah) line up with a pair of players who never ended up in the crosshairs—Brook and River.']

Game 0647, Day 1:
 Actual Mafia: River
Stevie 
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: River, Ronny  \n', 'Reason: Both River and Ronny repeatedly volunteered high-level “methods” to deflect suspicion—pointing at quiet players, echoers, or over-eager narrators—without ever naming a real suspect. They steered the flow of conversation in shifts, then seamlessly joined the eight-person pile-on vote to lynch Alex (an innocent). Their tactic of offering broad, non-specific theories, backing off before anyone could pin them down, and then voting with the crowd is classic mafia play.']

Game 0647, Day 2:
 Actual Mafia: River
Stevie 
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: Brook, Whitney  \n', 'Reason:  \n', '1) Both Brook and Whitney were unusually eager to lead and shape our suspicions throughout Day 2. They repeatedly zeroed in on others (first Alex, then Ronny/Adrian) with lengthy “case-building” posts that drew the group’s votes away from themselves.  \n', '2) Their arguments always felt a step ahead—offering just enough plausible reasoning to rally the majority, yet never exposing their own voting patterns or inconsistencies.  \n', '3) The night kills (Elliot, then Adrian) removed two of the sharpest question-askers, leaving Brook and Whitney—who had been deflecting scrutiny—untouched. That’s classic mafia play: target the independent voices and manipulate the vote to protect yourselves.  \n', '4) When the group finally turned on Ronny and then Adrian, Brook and Whitney both voted in lock-step with the mob, further cementing their cover. No one seriously suspected them, and they survived both lynches and night phases.  \n', 'Taken together, their heavy hand in directing every major lynch, combined with the night removals of stronger analysts, marks Brook and Whitney as the two mafia.']

Game 0647, Day 3:
 Actual Mafia: River
Stevie 
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: Tyler, Stevie  \n', 'Reason: By the end only four players remained—River, Stevie, Tyler, and Noah—but two were mafia.  In the last lynch (of Whitney) Tyler conspicuously never cast a recorded vote, and Stevie cast the lone dissenting vote for Noah instead of joining the consensus.  Both also repeatedly steered the discussion toward “quiet” players at critical junctures (the classic mafia deflection tactic) and benefited from bystander kills (Adrian and Brook) that followed their misdirection.  Their voting-time anomalies plus the pattern of deflecting blame onto others mark Tyler and Stevie as the remaining mafia.']

Game 0648, Day 1:
 Actual Mafia: River
Stevie 
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: Stevie, Brook  \n', 'Reason:  \n', '1. Night kill pattern – the mafia chose to eliminate Noah, who was a quieter, less-engaged player. Stevie and Brook both followed the same “fly-under-the-radar” chat style, and taking out a quiet player helps keep them hidden.  \n', '2. Voting behavior – mafia will never vote against their partner: Stevie and Brook both voted for Ronny, never for each other.  \n', '3. Dialogue analysis – Stevie and Brook’s contributions were mostly generic echoes of others (“watch quiet or pushy players,” fun facts) without genuine investigation or unique insights, fitting a “camouflage” mafia tactic.  \n', '4. Others were more actively analytical or took the lead (River, Alex, Elliot, Adrian, Tyler), making them less likely to be the hidden mafia. Together, Stevie and Brook best match the subtle, non-committal style and voting alignment of the two mafia.']

Game 0648, Day 2:
 Actual Mafia: River
Stevie 
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: Elliot, Tyler\n', '\n', 'Reason:  \n', '1. 10 players started; Ronny, Noah, Adrian and Whitney have all been confirmed as bystanders by lynch or night kill, leaving 6 candidates for 2 mafia spots.  \n', '2. Across the first two days of voting, every non‐mafia adjusted their vote in line with new discussion or the emerging consensus. Only two players stuck doggedly to the same target both rounds:  \n', '   - Elliot voted for Whitney on Day 1 and again on Day 2, despite the rest of the table moving on.  \n', '   - Tyler voted for Stevie on Day 1 and again on Day 2, likewise out of step each time.  \n', '3. This “stalwart” repetition is a classic mafia misdirection tactic: keeping an innocent under constant suspicion while letting others be sacrificed.  \n', '4. All other survivors shifted their votes as debates evolved—a normal bystander pattern—whereas Elliot and Tyler never broke from their initial picks.  \n', '5. The night kills (Noah, then Whitney) also fit a mafia strategy of silencing bystanders who were becoming more vocal or influential, while Elliot and Tyler remained untouched and continued their misleading vote streaks.  \n', '6. No other pair of survivors shows such a blatant, sustained misdirection pattern.  \n', '\n', 'Therefore, Elliot and Tyler are the two mafia.']

Game 0648, Day 3:
 Actual Mafia: River
Stevie 
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: Brook, Stevie\n', '\n', 'Reason:\n', '1. At the end there are four survivors (River, Brook, Stevie, Alex) and two must be mafia.  \n', '2. River and Alex consistently asked pointed questions, dug into vote patterns, and engaged in direct back‐and‐forth—a style more typical of bystanders earnestly hunting for the killers.  \n', '3. Brook and Stevie repeatedly stayed at a high level of “watch quiet/deflection” advice, echoing each other and seldom pitching concrete suspicions until forced. Their contributions were vague, situation‐neutral, and avoided naming suspects or digging into inconsistencies.  \n', '4. Neither Brook nor Stevie ever took a firm stance on anyone; they simply steered conversation generically. That pattern of noncommittal, reflexive guidance is a classic mafia play to derail focused scrutiny.  \n', '5. Both survived all the way through to the last four and fit the profile of players who keep discussion diffuse while quietly steering votes.  \n', '6. By contrast, River and Alex displayed the detailed, analytical questioning of genuine bystanders.  \n', '7. Therefore, Brook and Stevie are the two mafia.']

Game 0649, Day 1:
 Actual Mafia: River
Stevie 
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: Tyler, Elliot  \n', 'Reason: Over the course of Day 1, nearly everyone homed in on Tyler’s “infectious enthusiasm” and steered suspicion his way—yet when it came time to kill, the Mafia chose to eliminate Whitney (one of Tyler’s staunchest accusers), rather than silencing someone who’d never really keyed in on Tyler. That strongly points to Tyler as one of the Mafia.  \n', '\n', 'The only other player who consistently drove the conversation—proposing lineups of suspects, pushing everyone into questions that kept the focus off himself, and never drawing genuine peer‐to‐peer suspicion—was Elliot. Like Tyler, Elliot’s votes never wavered from killing an innocent, and he deftly redirected the group toward surface‐level clues instead of the deep‐down patterns that might have exposed the real killers. Together, those two patterns—Tyler’s immunity from the night kill and Elliot’s heavy steering without ever being pinned—mark them as the remaining Mafia.']

Game 0649, Day 2:
 Actual Mafia: River
Stevie 
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: River, Elliot  \n', 'Reason:  \n', '1) After four players (Noah, Whitney, Tyler, Alex) were removed—each of them repeatedly drew suspicion in the early gut‐feel rounds—only River and Elliot remain among the names that had been singled out. That pattern (innocents who are being “named” get killed, while River and Elliot survive) strongly suggests they’re steering the group to pick off bystanders.  \n', '2) In both discussions River and Elliot constantly drove the conversation (pushing for “direct questions” and “gut‐feel hunches”) but without ever committing to concrete accusations of their own—they stirred suspicion onto others then receded. That’s classic mafia behavior: guide the flow, sow doubt, then let innocents do the dirty work.  \n', '3) By contrast the other four remaining players (Ronny, Stevie, Brook, Adrian) each offered more grounded, specific observations at key moments and never escaped mention. They never survived multiple rounds of hunch nominations the way River and Elliot did.  \n', 'Together these clues point to River and Elliot as the two hidden mafia.']

Game 0649, Day 3:
 Actual Mafia: River
Stevie 
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: River, Brook  \n', 'Reason:  \n', '1) Both River and Brook consistently steered the conversation without ever drawing direct suspicion themselves. They frequently called for “gut feelings” or “patterns” rather than offering concrete evidence, a classic mafia dodge.  \n', '2) Early on, Brook repeatedly planted the seed that Alex was suspicious, and River backed off from pressing direct accusations—both lifelines that kept a genuine bystander like Alex alive too long and then used up innocent votes on them.  \n', '3) After the first lynch, each time the group lost a strong interrogator (first Noah, then Whitney, then Tyler, then Alex), River and Brook were right there deflecting blame back onto quieter players, ensuring they stayed off the chopping block.  \n', '4) Neither of them ever received meaningful vote pressure in the crucial final rounds, indicating the rest of the table saw them as innocent – exactly the cover good mafia aim for.  \n', '5) The night kill of Adrian fits their play – once the table’s key analysts were gone, mafia needed to remove the remaining clear voices.  \n', 'All of this points to River and Brook as the two mafia.']

Game 0650, Day 1:
 Actual Mafia: River
Stevie 
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: Brook, Ronny\n', '\n', 'Reason:  \n', '1) Both Brook and Ronny consistently posted high-volume, low-content “support” messages—cheering the discussion and asking others to speak—without ever planting a concrete suspicion of their own. That’s a classic mafia tactic for staying visible but unaccused.  \n', '2) Brook’s only real “accusation” was echoing everyone else’s focus on Alex, otherwise she added no fresh reads or personal reasoning.  \n', '3) Ronny never proposed any suspects at all and even broke with the lynch majority (voting Tyler when nearly everyone else went for Alex), which is suspiciously non-committal behavior.  \n', '4) After Alex was executed, the mafia killed Adrian—another bystander—indicating the real killers stayed under the radar, much like Brook and Ronny did in discussion.  \n', '5) In contrast, other players (e.g. Adrian, Elliot, Tyler) offered specific observations about conversation patterns or backed up their votes with reasoning, aligning them more with bystander behavior.  \n', '\n', 'Taken together, Brook’s and Ronny’s overly generic, deflection-focused presence points strongly to them being the remaining mafia.']

Game 0650, Day 2:
 Actual Mafia: River
Stevie 
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: Brook, Noah\n', '\n', 'Reason:  \n', '1. After the first lynch (Alex), the two mafia needed to throw suspicion onto other innocents and then coordinate on a safe vote. In Day 2’s vote, the tally for Tyler vs. Ronny was exactly 4–4, and Tyler (an innocent) went down on the tiebreak. That tie can only be arranged if both mafia votes go to Ronny while the six bystanders split 4–2 in Tyler’s favor.  In that round, the four Ronny-votes came from Brook, Noah, Whitney, and Tyler. Since Tyler was an innocent, the only way to get exactly two mafia votes on Ronny is if Brook and Noah were the ones putting their votes there.  \n', '2. In the very first discussion, Alex—an innocent—called out Brook and Noah as the two most aggressively pushing false lines of suspicion (“[…] anyone else feel like there’s a lot of heat coming from their direction?”). That early instinct aligned perfectly with who really was setting traps.  \n', '3. Neither Brook nor Noah ever broke away from the mafia’s need to deflect or quietly blend in. They both voted Alex first (to look innocent), then both switched to voting Ronny in Round 2 to force the tie and avenge the bystander loss by knocking Tyler off. Together these patterns uniquely pinpoint Brook and Noah as the two mafia.']

Game 0650, Day 3:
 Actual Mafia: River
Stevie 
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: Stevie,Brook  \n', 'Reason:  \n', '1. By the end of Day 3 only River, Stevie, Noah and Brook remained alive and exactly two mafia must be among them.  \n', '2. On each daytime, the first concrete kill‐recommendation that stuck always came from the same two voices: Brook on Day 1 (pointing at Alex) and Stevie on Days 2 and 3 (pointing at Tyler then Ronny). Those suggestions led the group to lynch innocent bystanders each time.  \n', '3. The real mafia would steer lynch votes onto innocents to protect themselves, and neither Brook nor Stevie were ever seriously suspected or lynched by the rest of the group.  \n', '4. Meanwhile, the two other survivors, River and Noah, consistently played in a neutral or supporting role and never drove a lynch, matching typical bystander behavior.  \n', '5. Thus the two players pattern‐matching mafia vote‐steering are Stevie and Brook.']

Game 0651, Day 1:
 Actual Mafia: River
Stevie 
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: Ronny, Tyler\n', '\n', 'Reason:  \n', '1. Vote patterns – both Ronny and Tyler cast their votes for Alex, who was ultimately lynched (a bystander). It looks like the two mafia coordinated to drive the lynch against an innocent.  \n', '2. No other mafia‐aligned block appears in the Whitney group (Noah, Elliot, Brook), which suggests both mafia voted for Alex.  \n', '3. In the day chat, Ronny and Tyler were among the strongest at steering strategy ("let’s get those discussions rolling," "paying attention to folks who are too eager to accuse"), consistent with mafia trying to direct suspicion.  \n', '4. That night, the mafia killed Brook—a player outside their voting bloc—further matching the idea that Ronny and Tyler were the two hidden mafia.']

Game 0651, Day 2:
 Actual Mafia: River
Stevie 
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: Whitney, Ronny  \n', 'Reason:  \n', '1) Night kills mirror Day 1 votes against Whitney: Brook and Elliot both died overnight after voting for Whitney on Day 1 – a classic “mafia kills those who suspect them” tell pointing squarely at Whitney.  \n', '2) Whitney consistently tried to steer suspicion onto others (“look at who jumped on votes” / “watch quiet players”) while never deflecting the pattern of her own accusers being killed.  \n', '3) Ronny’s behavior is overly busy-body: he repeatedly pivots the discussion to voting minutiae, deflects blame when challenged over his quick Day 1 vote on Alex, and plants suspicion on innocents (e.g. labeling Adrian’s vote “out of place”). That’s textbook mafia misdirection.  \n', '4) Neither Whitney nor Ronny ever got night-killed themselves, and they actively orchestrated debates to protect one another and keep focus off their growing pattern of mutual deflection.  \n', 'Together, those factors mark Whitney and Ronny as the remaining mafia.']

Game 0651, Day 3:
 Actual Mafia: River
Stevie 
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: Ronny, River\n', '\n', 'Reason:  \n', '1. Survivors are Stevie, Ronny, River, and Noah – two of these must be mafia.  \n', '2. Throughout the game Ronny and River repeatedly deflected suspicion away from themselves, spotlighted others, and coordinated their votes:  \n', '   - In the penultimate lynch (Adrian), both Ronny and River voted to exile the same innocent (Adrian), insuring a bystander was removed.  \n', '   - Ronny responded defensively when accused of “quick votes” (a common mafia tactic) and steered the group to re-examine voting patterns he’d already influenced.  \n', '   - River likewise repeatedly urged deeper scrutiny of others (Adrian, Ronny) while assuring the group her own strategy was “not mafia-driven,” a classic covert defensive move.  \n', '3. Neither Ronny nor River were ever targeted by the group’s suspicions in the final rounds, a strong indicator they were protected by secret knowledge (i.e. mafia status).  \n', '4. Their joint night-time kills (Brook, then Elliot, then Whitney) reflect a coordinated mafia effort to remove the strongest bystanders, not falling on one of their own.  \n', '5. By contrast, Stevie and Noah never self-defended under suspicion, followed the group’s reasoning instead of driving it, and ultimately voted against the players who turned out to be bystanders, marking them genuine bystanders rather than coordinating killers.  \n', 'Together these patterns identify Ronny and River as the two hidden mafia.']

Game 0652, Day 1:
 Actual Mafia: River
Stevie 
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: Alex, Brook  \n', 'Reason:  \n', '1. Vote alignment – Alex and Brook both voted with the 4-person majority to lynch Ronny, showing they were content to ride the group’s consensus rather than contribute independent reads.  \n', '2. Kill pattern – that same majority group (which included Elliot, Alex, Brook, Whitney) supplied the lynch; on Night 1 the mafia killed Whitney, a bystander from that bloc.  Mafia don’t kill their own, so at least two of the remaining trio in that majority must be mafia.  \n', '3. Conversation steering – Alex and Brook repeatedly championed “bold” vote plays and pushed focus onto others (e.g. suggesting spotlighting low-activity players), while suppressing deeper theorycraft of themselves.  Those are classic mafia moves to redirect suspicion.  \n', '4. Activity – both were highly active yet never took real risk in proposing a lynch of their own suspect; they steered the town to focus elsewhere, then sat back as Whitney got night-killed.  \n', 'Together these patterns point to Alex and Brook as the two mafia.']

Game 0652, Day 2:
 Actual Mafia: River
Stevie 
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: Stevie,Elliot  \n', 'Reason: By Day 2 only three players (Alex, Elliot and River) refrained from voting against Stevie, so the surviving mafia partner had to be one of them. Of those three, both Alex and Elliot had voted with the Day 1 majority (against Ronny) – a typical mafia move to help eliminate a bystander – whereas River did not. On Day 2, Elliot then cast the lone vote on River (drawing suspicion away from himself), and River (a bystander) immediately voted for Elliot in turn. That mutual accusation strongly points to Elliot as the remaining mafia alongside Stevie.']

Game 0652, Day 3:
 Actual Mafia: River
Stevie 
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: Stevie,River\n', '\n', 'Reason:  \n', '1. Only mafia can kill at night. On the first night after Day 1, Whitney was killed—proof there were still mafia active.  \n', '2. During Day 2, the group ultimately lynched Stevie, who was revealed as mafia.  \n', '3. After Stevie’s removal, another night kill occurred (Adrian), confirming one mafia remained.  \n', '4. On Day 3, votes centered on River (he’d voted in ways that fit a deflect-and-blend strategy), and he was lynched and revealed as the last mafia.  \n', '5. Thus the two mafia were Stevie and River.']

Game 0653, Day 1:
 Actual Mafia: River
Stevie 
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: River, Tyler  \n', 'Reason:  \n', '1) Night kill of Alex – removes a leading voice who was analyzing behavior.  \n', '2) Both River and Tyler repeatedly steered the conversation toward “voting‐pairs” that in fact never existed, naming specific duos whose votes did not match (River’s “Tyler & Noah,” Tyler’s “Elliot & River”).  \n', '3) None of the bystanders made those false pair‐alignment claims; they stuck to real patterns.  \n', '4) River and Tyler’s misdirections fit the classic mafia tactic of muddying the vote‐pattern analysis while they coordinate in the dark.']

Game 0653, Day 2:
 Actual Mafia: River
Stevie 
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: River, Brook\n', '\n', 'Reason:  \n', '1. After Elliot’s lynch and Alex’s nightkill, the group went on to lynch Tyler despite many earlier arrows pointed at different players. The mafia would have ridden the bandwagon to take out innocents (Tyler) and then killed another bystander (Noah) at night.  \n', '2. On Day 2 both River and Brook consistently voted for Tyler alongside the majority, steering the lynch toward an innocent. In contrast, true bystanders Adrian and Whitney refused to join that bloc.  \n', '3. In discussion both River and Brook repeatedly offered only vague “let’s look at voting pairs” or “watch for late shifts” lines and seldom pinned any firm suspicion on someone — a classic mafia tactic to appear helpful while deflecting real scrutiny.  \n', '4. They often echoed each other’s deflection points (obsessing over “patterns” and “late votes”) yet never seriously challenged one another, indicating a coordinated effort.  \n', '5. By contrast, other survivors (Adrian, Whitney, Stevie, Ronny) injected more concrete reads and were willing to break from the majority on key votes.  \n', '\n', 'Together, River and Brook’s voting alignment, conversational style, and deflection tactics mark them as the two remaining mafia.']

Game 0653, Day 3:
 Actual Mafia: River
Stevie 
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: Stevie, Adrian  \n', 'Reason: In the end only four players remained—Stevie, River, Ronny and Adrian—but two of them were mafia.  Looking at the day‐time votes, River and Ronny each picked up votes several times, and Whitney (a bystander) was also heavily targeted and ultimately lynched.  Neither Stevie nor Adrian ever received a single vote, despite both being active in steering discussion and deflecting suspicion onto others.  Mafia players want to fly under the radar and avoid votes, so the fact that Stevie and Adrian were never on the chopping block, while River and Ronny were, strongly points to Stevie and Adrian as the two mafia.']

Game 0654, Day 1:
 Actual Mafia: River
Stevie 
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: Ronny, Stevie  \n', 'Reason:  \n', '1. Neither Ronny nor Stevie was ever named or zeroed‐in on by the group despite everyone else being floated as suspects (Adrian, River, Tyler, Alex, Noah, Brook all got at least one direct mention).  \n', '2. Both gave only high-level “watch for mirroring or neutrality” advice but never tied their remarks to any real example or person—classic mafia obfuscation.  \n', '3. They both voted in lockstep with the rest to lynch Brook (a bystander) without having pushed Brook as a suspect beforehand, indicating they joined the innocent lynch rather than genuinely chasing leads.  \n', '4. That same night the mafia killed Tyler (also a bystander), a move that fits the pattern of eliminating active truth-seekers who might next start probing into Ronny or Stevie.  \n', '5. The combination of never being accused, avoiding specifics, and smartly riding the mob to dump innocents points squarely to Ronny and Stevie as the two mafia.']

Game 0654, Day 2:
 Actual Mafia: River
Stevie 
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: River, Elliot\n', '\n', 'Reason:  \n', '1. At the end there are six players left—Whitney, Stevie, Ronny, Elliot, River, and Alex—and exactly two must be mafia.  \n', '2. All four eliminated so far (Brook, Tyler, Noah, Adrian) turned out to be bystanders, leaving only the above six.  \n', '3. Throughout the discussions, River and Elliot consistently steered suspicion onto others (first Brook, then Alex/Noah) while avoiding any serious scrutiny of themselves.  \n', '4. River habitually echoed group sentiment and deflected attention (“let’s all revisit X’s responses”) without ever volunteering new substantive clues—classic mafia camouflage.  \n', '5. Elliot repeatedly led the charge to examine other players’ “too polished” or “too smooth” answers and asked the group to re‐evaluate them, yet never answered direct calls for his own specific examples—another tell of deflection.  \n', '6. Neither River nor Elliot was ever targeted or seriously questioned when everyone else fell under suspicion, yet they remain alive. That pattern—surviving multiple mislynches by deflecting and blending in—strongly indicates they are the two mafia.']

Game 0654, Day 3:
 Actual Mafia: River
Stevie 
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: River, Elliot\n', '\n', 'Reason:  \n', '1. From Day 1 through the late game, River’s contributions were consistently neutral, polished, and deflective—echoing others without ever proposing a fresh line of attack. That mirrored classic “fly under the radar” mafia behavior.  \n', '2. River survived to a late vote, then was finally lynched and revealed as mafia.  \n', '3. After River’s lynch, only one mafia remained to make the night kill—Whitney’s death—so the surviving mafia at that point must be the other member.  \n', '4. Elliot showed similar patterns of polished responses and subtle steering of discussions. He frequently asked others to share suspicions, seemed to deflect direct questioning, and stayed just cooperative enough to avoid strong suspicion.  \n', '5. No other survivor demonstrated that same level of strategic deflection paired with staying alive through multiple rounds.  \n', '6. Therefore the two mafia were River and Elliot.']

Game 0654, Day 4:
 Actual Mafia: River
Stevie 
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: River, Stevie  \n', 'Reason:  \n', '1. Two mafia were in the game; River was revealed when the group lynched them on Day 3.  \n', '2. After River’s elimination, only one mafia remained.  \n', '3. In the final days, Stevie drew the most suspicion for “too polished” or “smoothly evasive” comments and was voted for by Ronny and Elliot.  \n', '4. Elliot (a bystander) was lynched in a split vote instead of Stevie, and that night Alex (a bystander) was killed—meaning the surviving mafia chose Alex.  \n', '5. The only player still alive with that ability is Stevie.  \n', '6. Thus the two mafia were River and Stevie.']

Game 0655, Day 1:
 Actual Mafia: River
Stevie 
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: River, Noah  \n', 'Reason:  \n', '1. River goes out in a huge pile-on: from the moment Noah first pins “echoing” behavior on River, everyone else locks in on River with virtually no concrete evidence. That’s a classic mafia deflection—sacrifice one mobster early to build trust.  \n', '2. Noah’s role in steering suspicion is suspicious. He’s the only one who specifically called out River for “just following the crowd,” then the group seamlessly follows his lead despite having no firm proof. Innocent players rarely manage such a flawless, unanimous lynch.  \n', '3. The nighttime kill of Elliot fits a mafia strategy of removing the most vocal, analytical bystander. Elliot was repeatedly pushing for specifics and could’ve exposed the remaining mafia in future rounds.  \n', '4. After River’s lynch, the group’s confidence in Noah rises (he “called it first”), making it unlikely they’d consider him next—precisely the kind of cover a single remaining mafia would cultivate.  \n', 'All signs point to River and Noah as the two mafias.']

Game 0655, Day 2:
 Actual Mafia: River
Stevie 
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: River, Stevie  \n', 'Reason:  \n', '1. On Day 1 the group repeatedly flagged River for “echoing” the majority and voting without personal reasoning—River aligned too neatly with others and stayed quiet when pressed. The town voted River out, and the role was revealed as Mafia.  \n', '2. After River’s elimination and Elliot’s nighttime death, similar patterns resurfaced. The remaining players noted someone again voting too comfortably with the crowd and contributing little new insight. Suspicion focused on Stevie, who was then voted out and revealed as the second Mafia.']

Game 0656, Day 1:
 Actual Mafia: River
Stevie 
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: Elliot, Brook  \n', 'Reason:  \n', '1) On Day 1 only two players voted for Ronny (Elliot and Brook), and Ronny turned out to be the Night 1 kill. In many mafia games the killers target the cop/detective, and the mafia will often day-vote that detective to paint them as “suspicious.”  \n', '2) No one else day-voted Ronny, so Elliot and Brook are the only ones signaling against him.  \n', '3) Ronny’s single detective-style comment (“maybe we’ve got some detectives in the mix…”) and his subsequent murder strongly point to him being the cop. Only the mafia would both draw suspicion to him in voting and then remove him at night.  \n', '4) All other players either split votes broadly or voted for non-detective targets, so Elliot and Brook stand out as the two mafia.']

Game 0656, Day 2:
 Actual Mafia: River
Stevie 
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: River, Noah\n', '\n', 'Reason:  \n', '1. Who’s left? After lynching Tyler & Elliot and the nights’ kills (Ronny, Whitney), the six survivors are River, Stevie, Brook, Noah, Adrian, and Alex. Two of them must be Mafia.  \n', '2. Night‐kill pattern: The Mafia have eliminated the most vocal players (Ronny on Night 1; Whitney on Night 2), a classic Mafia tactic to stifle discussion. They left quieter voices alive.  \n', '3. Discussion dynamics:  \n', '   - River and Noah were unusually moderate early on, offering generic “let’s look at voting patterns” commentary but naming no firm suspects.  \n', '   - When the stakes got higher, both pivoted the group’s suspicion away from themselves and toward Brook/Alex, repeatedly urging “everyone’s talking about Alex and Brook” as if planting that idea.  \n', '   - River and Noah never drew suspicion themselves despite steering the conversation, whereas Brook and Alex became the focus.  \n', '4. Deflection signs: By subtly repeating “Alex and Brook have been mentioned a lot” and “we should zone in on those two,” River and Noah effectively manipulated the group’s ire onto innocents. That sustained deflection is a hallmark Mafia move.  \n', '5. By contrast, Stevie and Adrian never doggedly pinned blame on the same pair, and Brook/Alex only tried to steer based on actual vote data.  \n', '\n', 'Together, these patterns point to River and Noah as the two Mafia.']

Game 0656, Day 3:
 Actual Mafia: River
Stevie 
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: River, Stevie\n', '\n', 'Reason:\n', '1.  After six eliminations (Tyler, Ronny, Elliot, Whitney, Brook, Alex—all revealed as bystanders), the four survivors are River, Stevie, Noah and Adrian. Only two of the survivors can be mafia.  \n', '2.  On Day 3 the lynch target was Brook, but River and Stevie both voted for Alex instead of joining the 3-vote majority on Brook.  A coordinated mis-vote like that is exactly the sort of subtle blocking tactic mafia use to keep a bystander in the seat of danger.  \n', '3.  Likewise on Day 1, the votes fell into three tied pairs (Tyler/ Ronny/ River all at two votes); River and Stevie’s votes were both cast off the main pack (they each voted for someone who only got one vote), helping engineer that tie instead of rallying on a genuine bystander.  \n', '4.  By contrast Noah and Adrian consistently voted with the majority when it was clear which player the group was targeting.  \n', '5.  The night kills (Ronny, Whitney, Alex) all took out strong, very active bystanders—another hallmark of mafia targeting the most effective non-mafia voices.  \n', '6.  Only River and Stevie remain both alive at the end and willing to split the group’s votes away from the true lynch targets; that pairing of mis-votes strongly marks them as the two hidden mafia.']

Game 0657, Day 1:
 Actual Mafia: River
Stevie 
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: Adrian, Alex\n', '\n', 'Reason:  \n', '1. Both Adrian and Alex were by far the most active at steering the discussion—repeatedly proposing voting strategies, naming suspects, and defining the “quiet vs. vocal” framework—yet they themselves never came under sustained scrutiny.  \n', '2. They consistently deflected suspicion onto others (calling out “quiet players” or those “too eager to lead”), without ever offering concrete evidence or admitting any real hunch about themselves.  \n', '3. In a room full of generic, friendly chatter, their highly structured, agenda-driven posts stand out as the sort of coordinated narrative control mafia use to frame innocents and avoid drawing attention to themselves.  \n', '4. Finally, the night kill of Elliot—a middling participant who had begun to ask pointed questions about behavior—fits the pattern of a mafia duo eliminating the one player most likely to break their controlling narrative next day.  \n', 'Taken together, Adrian and Alex best fit the profile of the two hidden mafia.']

Game 0657, Day 2:
 Actual Mafia: River
Stevie 
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: Adrian, Noah\n', '\n', 'Reason:  \n', '1) Nightkills line up with who was painting themselves as “too active.”  \n', '   - On Night 2 Tyler dies – he’d just publicly flagged Adrian (and Alex), so killing him protects Adrian.  \n', '2) Both Adrian and Noah repeatedly steered the conversation onto innocent targets, especially Alex:  \n', '   - Early in Day 2 Noah singles out “Alex, Adrian, and Tyler” as suspicious, immediately pushing the vote.  \n', '   - Adrian quickly echoes that Alex (and other vocal players) deserve fresh scrutiny and piles on suspicion.  \n', '3) Their pattern of “quiet” bystander kills also fits:  \n', '   - Night 1 Elliot (a low‐profile player who never truly pinned anyone) is taken out – a classic mafia stealth move.  \n', '   - Night 2 they eliminate Tyler after he’d called out Adrian.  \n', '4) In both lynches they orchestrated consensus voting against innocent players:  \n', '   - Day 1 they deflected onto Brook.  \n', '   - Day 2 they unanimously drove the group to lynch Alex.  \n', '5) No one else so consistently led and then “protected” themselves at kill‐time, while Adrian and Noah escaped unscathed.  \n', '\n', 'All together, Adrian and Noah’s heavy deflection, timing of votes, and the choices of who to kill most strongly mark them as the two mafia.']

Game 0657, Day 3:
 Actual Mafia: River
Stevie 
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: Stevie,River\n', '\n', 'Reason:  \n', '1. After Day 3’s vote, Ronny was the only one to put his vote on Stevie. The mafia’s very next Night kill was Ronny, consistent with them silencing the one player who had correctly pegged a mafia. That strongly implicates Stevie.  \n', '2. Across all discussions, River never drew any real scrutiny or specific accusation—even when other players were forced to name suspects. They consistently steered conversation in vague, deflecting directions, which is classic mafia behavior.  \n', '3. By contrast, the other final survivors (Noah and Whitney) each suffered moments of suspicion and were almost named as potential mafia by their peers, making them unlikely to be the hidden duo.  \n', '4. The kill pattern (targeting those who suspected or threatened them) plus the absence of any credible challenge to River’s self-exonerating neutrality point to Stevie and River as the two mafia.']

Game 0658, Day 1:
 Actual Mafia: River
Stevie 
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: Alex, Ronny\n', '\n', 'Reason:  \n', '1) Tyler—the only player to vote for Ronny—was a bystander. In most games, when an otherwise uninvolved townsperson (Tyler) zeroes in on someone no one else suspects, it’s a strong tell. Tyler’s lone vote suggests Ronny’s behavior quietly rang alarm bells for a town player who wasn’t being guided by the majority.  \n', '2) Alex repeatedly redirected suspicion onto others without offering concrete evidence or fresh ideas. He was quick to name targets (Stevie, Tyler) yet never advanced the discussion with genuine reads or observations—classic mafia deflection.  \n', '3) Ronny maintained a high‐energy, agreeable front but never contributed any substantive strategy. He echoed the table’s ideas without vetting them or pushing the group toward any real conclusions, a trait common among mafia trying to fly under the radar.  \n', '4) Together, Alex and Ronny subtly steered the vote toward lynching Tyler (an innocent) and then eliminated an observant bystander (Elliot) at night—behaviors consistent with mafia preserving themselves and dismantling town clarity.  \n', 'Based on these patterns—one solid town read on Ronny and the strategic, unfounded finger-pointing by Alex—they are the two remaining mafia.']

Game 0658, Day 2:
 Actual Mafia: River
Stevie 
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: River, Whitney  \n', 'Reason:  \n', '1) On Day 1 River was the only player to single out Alex—calling Alex “quick to latch onto safe points without adding much original thought.” That planted the seed of suspicion that bloomed on Day 2.  \n', '2) On Day 2 the lynch of Alex was orchestrated by a very early, very forceful push to “focus on Alex (and Ronny),” led and doubled-down on almost immediately by Whitney. She spoke first after the night kill and repeatedly steered everyone toward Alex.  \n', '3) The mafia must be among the six survivors (Noah, Whitney, Brook, River, Stevie, Adrian). They successfully directed two lynches (Tyler Day 1, Alex Day 2) and two night kills (Elliot, Ronny) at bystanders—classic mafia strategy.  \n', '4) River’s Day 1 seed of suspicion against Alex and Whitney’s Day 2 narrative control fit the pattern of covertly guiding the town to eliminate innocents while keeping themselves hidden.  \n', 'Therefore the two remaining mafia are River and Whitney.']

Game 0658, Day 3:
 Actual Mafia: River
Stevie 
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: Brook, River  \n', 'Reason:  \n', '1. Both Brook and River constantly led and steered discussions—first by highlighting “quiet” players (ironically themselves) and then deftly shifting suspicion onto others—while the rest of the table chased red herrings.  \n', '2. They never drew sustained scrutiny, even though they were unusually quick to propose vote targets and name‐drop innocents, letting genuine bystanders like Tyler, Alex, Whitney and Adrian get lynched instead.  \n', '3. Their mutual reinforcement of each other’s suggestions and persistent “helpful” commentary without contributing real evidence matches the classic mafia play of guiding the town to destroy itself while flying under the radar.  \n', '4. In every round they survived, public suspicion swung away from them onto more vocal, well‐meaning players—exactly what two coordinating mafia would engineer.']

Game 0659, Day 1:
 Actual Mafia: River
Stevie 
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: Noah,Brook  \n', 'Reason:  \n', '1. Nightkill target Alex had specifically flagged Noah and Brook as “too consistent/neutral” and suggested keeping an eye on them.  \n', '2. Mafia tend to eliminate anyone who points at them, and Alex’s comments put Noah and Brook in the hot seat.  \n', '3. During Day 1 both Noah and Brook blended in by echoing others’ ideas without bringing strong new leads—classic mafia behavior.  \n', '4. No other pair explains why Alex (rather than someone else) was chosen for the night kill. Therefore the two mafia must be Noah and Brook.']

Game 0659, Day 2:
 Actual Mafia: River
Stevie 
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: Noah, Ronny  \n', 'Reason:  \n', '1) Voting patterns  \n', '- On Day 2, Tyler (a bystander) was lynched 4–4 over Noah. Of the four who voted for Tyler—Whitney (innocent), Brook, Noah, and Ronny—exactly two must be mafia. Whitney was killed by the mafia that night, so she wasn’t a partner.  \n', '- Both Noah and Ronny consistently voted to eliminate bystanders rather than each other (Day 1’s Elliot and Day 2’s Tyler), a classic mafia tactic to protect teammates.  \n', '\n', '2) Deflection of suspicion  \n', '- Noah was the prime target of suspicion on both Day 1 and Day 2, yet he never faced elimination—he steered attention onto quieter “innocent” players instead.  \n', '- Ronny repeatedly echoed the group’s leads and pointed the finger at others (quiet players, the overly eager), while keeping himself largely above reproach, which is how a mafia partner would hide in plain sight.  \n', '\n', '3) Silence about each other  \n', '- Noah and Ronny never seriously suspected one another, even as they sowed doubt about everyone else. Their mutual non-accusation lines up with two players coordinating from the inside.  \n', '\n', 'Taken together, the aligned votes for innocent targets and the coordinated deflection by Noah and Ronny mark them as the two remaining mafia.']

Game 0659, Day 3:
 Actual Mafia: River
Stevie 
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: River, Adrian  \n', 'Reason: After three bystander lynches (Elliot, Tyler, Noah) and three bystander night kills (Alex, Whitney, Brook), only River, Adrian, Ronny, and Stevie remain – two of them must be mafia.  \n', '1) Brook’s final comment on Day 3 specifically called out River and Adrian for “steering” the conversations too smoothly and wanting to hear their “instincts,” and then Brook was immediately killed that night. Mafia will target players who directly accuse them.  \n', '2) Throughout the game, River and Adrian dominated the discussion—constantly prompting votes, steering focus onto quieter players, and deflecting suspicion—classic mafia tactics to control the narrative and stay under the radar.  \n', '3) In contrast, Ronny and Stevie were more reactive and never pushed hard accusations, fitting the profile of innocent bystanders.  \n', 'Together, the timing of Brook’s killing and the conversation-steering behavior point squarely at River and Adrian as the mafia.']

Game 0660, Day 1:
 Actual Mafia: River
Stevie 
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: Tyler, River\n', '\n', 'Reason:\n', '1. Vote divergence  \n', '   - At the end of Day 1, everyone except Tyler and Whitney voted to lynch Adrian. Whitney proved to be a bystander (she was then killed at night). That leaves Tyler as the sole player who deliberately broke with the town’s consensus—classic mafia behavior to protect a partner by diluting suspicion.\n', '\n', '2. Subtle steering & echoing  \n', '   - River spoke at length but never advanced any concrete suspicions, instead mirroring others’ concerns and blending in. That’s a known mafia tactic: stay active enough to avoid looking absent, but never step forward with a genuine theory.\n', '\n', '3. Night kill target  \n', '   - The mafia chose to kill Whitney, one of the few people calling out repetitive or echoing speech patterns (and who might otherwise have shifted focus onto Tyler or River). A mafia team often silences a vocal bystander rather than one of their own.\n', '\n', '4. Combined profile  \n', '   - Tyler’s lone dissenting vote and River’s “active but noncommittal” participation align with two mafia working in tandem: one quietly protecting the other in voting, the other sowing confusion with lots of talk but no real direction.']

Game 0660, Day 2:
 Actual Mafia: River
Stevie 
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: Brook,Tyler  \n', 'Reason:  \n', '1. After the second daytime, Ronny was lynched with three votes (Tyler, Elliot, Brook).  \n', '2. That night Elliot (one of the three) was killed by the mafia—proving he was a bystander.  \n', '3. Therefore the other two who voted for Ronny (Brook and Tyler) must be the mafia, since they voted with the majority to blend in and weren’t eliminated.  \n', '4. No other voting blocs point as cleanly at two players who both remained alive and voted Ronny at Day 2.  \n', '5. Hence the remaining mafia are Brook and Tyler.']

Game 0660, Day 3:
 Actual Mafia: River
Stevie 
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: Tyler, River  \n', 'Reason: By the end there were only four players left—Alex, Tyler, River, and Stevie—and two of them had to be mafia.  Alex and Stevie were both highly engaged, offered new ideas, and pushed hard on analysis; those are classic town‐aligned behaviors.  Tyler and River, by contrast, repeatedly adopted a low‐profile “echoing” style: they stayed just involved enough to avoid looking quiet, but never steered conversations with original insights.  Both made uncharacteristic shifts (Tyler’s unusually muted presence and River’s neutral stance compared with past games) that read like deliberate camouflage.  That pattern of subtle blending without adding fresh content is far more consistent with mafia play, and it explains how they survived to the final four while repeatedly deflecting suspicion onto others.']

Game 0661, Day 1:
 Actual Mafia: River
Stevie 
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: Brook, River  \n', 'Reason:  \n', '1) Night kill targeted Adrian—the very player who first pressed Brook—strongly implying Brook used her mafia authority to eliminate that threat.  \n', '2) Brook and River were the only two who voted for Adrian in the final tally; by coordinating on an innocent target rather than the public’s choice (Elliot), they split the vote to help ensure a bystander died.  \n', '3) River’s contributions were almost entirely vague calls to “watch for quiet players” and “avoid bandwagons,” yet he never gave concrete observations and notably refused to join the majority in lynching Elliot. That misalignment and generic deflection are classic mafia tactics.  \n', '4) Brook likewise leaned on general talk about “quick vote shifts” without ever pinning down specifics or naming real suspects—again a hallmark of mafia players sowing confusion instead of evidence.  \n', 'Together, their voting pattern, dialogue style, and the post‐lynch kill point unmistakably to Brook and River as the two mafia.']

Game 0661, Day 2:
 Actual Mafia: River
Stevie 
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: Tyler, Noah  \n', 'Reason:  \n', '1. After two nights and two lynches, the six survivors are Tyler, Ronny, Brook, River, Stevie, and Noah—two of them are mafia.  \n', '2. In Day 1’s vote the town target was Elliot; mafia should help push through an innocent lynch. Of the survivors, only Tyler, Stevie, and Noah voted to lynch Elliot.  \n', '3. In Day 2’s vote the town target was Alex; again mafia will vote to lynch that innocent. Of the survivors, only Tyler and Noah voted for Alex.  \n', '4. Stevie voted differently on Day 2 and the others (Ronny, Brook, River) did not vote for Elliot on Day 1, so the only two who consistently sided with the town’s innocent targets both days are Tyler and Noah. Those are the mafia.']

Game 0661, Day 3:
 Actual Mafia: River
Stevie 
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: River, Brook  \n', 'Reason:  \n', '1. River was confirmed mafia when lynched on Day 3.  \n', '2. On Day 3 Brook cast her lynch vote against Stevie (an innocent), and on every previous lynch Brook’s vote fell on bystanders, mirroring River’s own “vote for a bystander” pattern—classic mafia misdirection.  \n', '3. Brook repeatedly redirected suspicion toward others (Noah, Tyler, Ronny) instead of engaging concretely, and when Tyler began zeroing in on her, River killed Tyler that night—protecting Brook.  \n', '4. By contrast, genuine bystanders (Ronny, Noah) accurately voted against River on Day 3.  \n', '5. Eliminating Brook would have been the best bystander move on Day 3; instead, Brook stayed while an innocent (Stevie) fell, consistent with mafia protecting their partner.  \n', 'Together these patterns point to River and Brook as the two mafia.']

Game 0661, Day 4:
 Actual Mafia: River
Stevie 
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: River, Stevie  \n', 'Reason:  \n', '1. River’s guilt was confirmed on Day 3 when the town finally voted him out and he showed up as mafia.  \n', '2. Stevie repeatedly steered discussion away from herself, deflecting suspicion onto innocents (notably Brook and even already‐dead Noah), without ever offering concrete evidence.  \n', '3. At the start of the final day, Stevie pushed hard to “dig deeper into Brook and Noah,” setting them up as targets – that same night Brook was killed by the mafia.  \n', '4. That pattern of false accusation followed by a mafia‐style kill (Brook) strongly indicates Stevie was the second mafia.']

Game 0662, Day 1:
 Actual Mafia: River
Stevie 
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: Ronny,Tyler  \n', 'Reason:  \n', '1) In the Day vote Alex went down with 6 votes; the only votes against Whitney were Ronny, Tyler (and Alex himself). That pair consistently refused to go with the town majority.  \n', '2) That same town‐chosen Day target, Whitney, was killed that Night. Mafia often split their Day votes on the person they plan to Night‐kill to disguise their partnership.  \n', '3) Neither Ronny nor Tyler ever drew strong suspicion in the discussions, yet both subtly steered or deflected just enough to avoid the rally behind Alex—classic Mafia behavior of “fly under the radar” while shaping the vote.  \n', '4) River—the only other player who failed to vote Alex—voted Elliot instead, making him a likely innocent outlier. Ronny and Tyler remain the two who coordinated against the town both Day and Night.  \n', '5) With Alex and Whitney confirmed Town, Ronny and Tyler are the remaining pair who fit the patterns of Mafia collusion.']

Game 0662, Day 2:
 Actual Mafia: River
Stevie 
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: River, Elliot  \n', 'Reason:  \n', '1. River and Elliot were the two players who most consistently steered suspicion away from each other and onto others.  \n', '2. On Day 2, the group homed in on River and Ronny as top suspects; the town unanimously lynched River, and that very night the remaining mafia killed Ronny—showing that River’s partner was the one pulling the strings behind the scenes.  \n', '3. Elliot repeatedly echoed “quiet or steering” analyses to deflect blame and never drew enough suspicion to be lynched, surviving two days when innocent players like Alex and Whitney were eliminated.  \n', '4. The only way River’s night‐kill and Ronny’s subsequent night‐kill could happen is if River and Elliot were the mafia duo: River was caught at the end of Day 2, leaving Elliot as the lone surviving mafia.']

Game 0662, Day 3:
 Actual Mafia: River
Stevie 
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: River, Adrian  \n', 'Reason:  \n', '1) River’s play was classic mafia: echoing others’ points without adding new info, deflecting suspicion onto quieter players, and subtly steering the discussion away from themselves. That pattern held true until they were finally lynched as mafia.  \n', '2) Adrian repeatedly parroted others’ observations, suggested “let’s focus on Tyler and Adrian” (i.e. including himself) to appear transparent, and echoed the safe‐blending tactic after River died. He never genuinely pushed a unique line of inquiry and consistently deflected close scrutiny. Those echoing, deflective patterns mirror River’s mafia style, marking Adrian as the second mafia.']

Game 0662, Day 4:
 Actual Mafia: River
Stevie 
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: River, Stevie  \n', 'Reason:  \n', '1. River’s chat style was a textbook mafia play—he repeatedly echoed others, steered the conversation in very general terms, and never offered concrete accusations. The group eventually zeroed in on him and successfully lynched him on Day 2, confirming he was mafia.  \n', '2. The other mafia must mirror those same tactics, and Stevie’s behavior fits that pattern. She was unusually active—posting many times to “guide” the discussion—but rarely backed up specific suspicions with evidence. She consistently pushed for voting out bystanders, including in the final rounds when it made no logical sense for a genuine detective to do so.  \n', '3. In the home stretch (final four), Brook explicitly named Stevie as suspicious, and that very night the mafia killed Brook—strongly suggesting Stevie was the killer protecting herself.  \n', '4. Stevie’s voting record also aligns with mafia strategy: she always voted to eject bystanders rather than risk exposing herself.  \n', 'Taken together, River’s lynch and Stevie’s conversation-steering and voting behavior mark them as the two mafia players.']

Game 0663, Day 1:
 Actual Mafia: River
Stevie 
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: River, Ronny  \n', 'Reason: Both River and Ronny exhibit the classic “mafia mirror‐and‐deflect” pattern.  \n', '1) They never truly anchor on a concrete suspect but instead keep echoing everybody else’s ideas, asking endless “what do you think?” questions and offering broad strategies (“watch quiet players or over-eager accusers”) without ever committing.  \n', '2) When the vote started to close in on them around the end, each even went so far as to self-accuse—“maybe even River has been flying under the radar,” “we’ve zeroed in on Adrian, Tyler, and myself (Ronny)…”—a ploy to appear honest bystanders.  \n', '3) Both also dutifully joined the majority in lynching Adrian (a bystander), ensuring the real mafia pair stayed hidden, and then at night they killed Whitney, another bystander who never raised much suspicion of them.  \n', 'Together, this pushing of vague tactics, echoing everyone else, repeated self-incrimination, and solidly voting with the crowd points to River and Ronny as the two mafia.']

Game 0663, Day 2:
 Actual Mafia: River
Stevie 
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: River, Ronny  \n', 'Reason:  \n', '1. At the end of Day 2 the group homed in on River and Ronny as “flying under the radar,” and River was lynched as mafia.  \n', '2. That same night the remaining mafia killed Elliot. Elliot’s Day 2 posts repeatedly flagged Ronny (“let’s re-examine Ronny and River”), so the surviving mafia had motive to eliminate Elliot.  \n', '3. Ronny’s Day 2 behavior was classic “self-suspect” misdirection—he openly suggested we should watch “players like me or River” who hadn’t drawn immediate heat. That is a known mafia tactic to appear honest.  \n', '4. Ronny also refrained from voting for River on Day 2 (he voted for Elliot) while most bystanders correctly went after River. The true partner in crime likewise avoids voting down their teammate.  \n', '5. Taken together—River’s lynch, Elliot’s murder, and Ronny’s deflective chat-and-vote patterns—point to River and Ronny as the two mafia.']

Game 0663, Day 3:
 Actual Mafia: River
Stevie 
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: River, Brook  \n', 'Reason:  \n', '1) We know River was confirmed mafia when lynched on Day 2.  \n', '2) Throughout Day 3’s debate River is already gone, but one mafia remains.  That day everyone hammered Tyler and Ronny as suspects—Ronny was lynched and Tyler was killed at night—while Brook never once drew serious suspicion.  \n', '3) Brook’s posts repeatedly and aggressively steered the conversation onto Tyler and Ronny (e.g. “let’s re-analyze Tyler and Ronny’s patterns,” “Tyler’s voting style stands out,” “we can’t afford another mistake—Tyler and Ronny deserve our focus”), deflecting attention from herself.  \n', '4) Brook’s tactic perfectly set up the group to lynch one innocent (Ronny) and allowed the mafia to kill the other (Tyler).  \n', '5) That same deflection pattern, plus Brook’s eagerness to lead the discussion, matches classic mafia play—hiding in plain sight by forcing votes onto others.  \n', 'Therefore the two mafia were River and Brook.']

Game 0663, Day 4:
 Actual Mafia: River
Stevie 
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: River, Stevie\n', '\n', 'Reason:  \n', '1. Early in the game River was unusually “safe”—he echoed whatever line was most popular, added no new information, and deflected suspicion by voting for Adrian instead of himself when the group’s ire turned toward Adrian. That pattern of playing “innocent” but never truly engaging in constructive sleuthing is classic mafia behavior. On Day 2 River was finally lynched and revealed as mafia.  \n', '2. After River fell, the only other player whose dialogue and voting style matched that same subtle “fly-under-the-radar” pattern was Stevie. From the start Stevie agreed with every mainstream suggestion without ever committing to a novel theory, repeatedly pushed the same dual focus on the quiet and the overly eager, then in the final days cast an unprompted vote against Brook while everyone else honed in on Stevie. That misdirection, combined with never staking out a unique line of investigation, strongly indicated mafia. On the last day Stevie was lynched and proved to be the second mafia.']

Game 0664, Day 1:
 Actual Mafia: River
Stevie 
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: Tyler, Noah  \n', 'Reason:  \n', '1) Both Tyler and Noah repeatedly drove the “echoing/blending‐in” narrative, zeroing in on Brook (an innocent) to frame her while deftly avoiding scrutiny of their own contributions.  \n', '2) Tyler in particular deflected suspicion onto Alex right before Alex was killed at night—a classic mafia kill target who’d been pushing the echo angle.  \n', '3) Noah not only led the push for list‐based “quiet” suspects but never truly defended or explained his own behavior, instead steering the group toward Tyler and Brook.  \n', '4) Their voting patterns align with mafia strategy: both voted out Brook (an innocent) and silently slipped out of the spotlight themselves.  \n', '5) No other players combined both the heavy misdirection and the subsequent night kill alignment that Tyler and Noah exhibited.']

Game 0664, Day 2:
 Actual Mafia: River
Stevie 
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: Elliot, Adrian  \n', 'Reason:  \n', '1) Vote analysis on Day 2 shows the two mafia voted with the Tyler‐kill majority.  Tyler was voted out by Whitney, Adrian, Ronny and Elliot – only mafia would reliably vote with the pack on an “obvious” bystander to keep themselves hidden.  Removing Whitney’s vote (she’s a bystander) leaves Adrian, Ronny and Elliot as that voting bloc, and two of those three must be mafia.  \n', '2) Elliot repeatedly led the charge on accusing Brook in Day 1 (“One name that comes to mind for me is Brook...”), and Brook was the Day 1 victim – a classic mafia tactic of steering the vote onto an innocent.  \n', '3) Adrian injected odd “time‐stamp” and “quiet‐observer” angles from the very start, then again on Day 2, deflecting suspicion onto subtler behaviors.  That pattern of offering misleading meta–criteria rather than concrete slates is typical of mafia misdirection.  \n', '4) Neither Elliot nor Adrian were seriously suspected (or voted for) by the two small “counter‐blocks” (Noah/Tyler on Ronny, and River/Stevie on Elliot) at Day 2, which fits mafia casting full votes for the chosen bystander while passing on other targets.  \n', '5) Both Alex and Whitney – two of the more outspoken, observant bystanders – were murdered that night, suggesting the mafia were eliminating genuine discussion‐leaders.  Elliot and Adrian, by contrast, kept a low profile between pushes of vague “check the quiet ones” or “watch voting patterns,” marking them as the hidden pair controlling the table.']

Game 0664, Day 3:
 Actual Mafia: River
Stevie 
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: River, Stevie\n', '\n', 'Reason:\n', '1. At every lynch the group voted out players who drew explicit suspicion; the two surviving mafia never drew a single vote against them, fitting the pattern that mafia avoid suspicion.  \n', '2. Elliot briefly drew some votes before being left alive, so he’s almost certainly a bystander; the three never‐voted players are Noah, River, Stevie, and two of those must be mafia.  \n', '3. River repeatedly volunteered specific “I voted for Elliot because…” explanations that shifted blame onto Elliot—classic mafia misdirection.  \n', '4. Stevie also steered suspicion toward Elliot and urged the group to follow subtle narrative cues rather than concrete evidence, mirroring River’s strategy.  \n', '5. Noah, by contrast, was a steady synthesizer of the group’s ideas and never orchestrated a forced deflection onto a fellow player.  \n', '\n', 'Therefore the two mafia players are River and Stevie.']

Game 0665, Day 1:
 Actual Mafia: River
Stevie 
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: Adrian, River\n', '\n', 'Reason:  \n', '1. During the day, Adrian was the first to single out Ronny—calling him “supportive but never bringing new perspectives”—and then dropped out of the discussion, steering the vote without ever defending himself or offering alternative suspects. That kind of over‐eager framing and sudden silence fits a mafia planting a target.  \n', '2. River repeatedly echoed others’ points without adding original analysis, only stepping in to “self-adjust” once directly called out for echoing. Honest players who are flagged tend to defend or counter with specific arguments, not merely apologize and promise to do better.  \n', '3. Whitney was killed at night immediately after she voiced suspicion of River. Mafia often eliminate the one player who’s zeroed in on them.  \n', '4. Together these patterns—the Ronny framing by Adrian, the echoing-then-deflecting behavior by River, and the nighttime removal of Whitney (who had called out River)—point to Adrian and River as the two mafia.']

Game 0665, Day 2:
 Actual Mafia: River
Stevie 
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: River, Tyler  \n', 'Reason:  \n', '1) Voting patterns point strongly at River and Tyler. In both Day 1 and Day 2 they voted with the majority to lynch innocents (Day 1 Ronny, Day 2 Adrian), behavior typical of mafia trying to stay under the radar.  \n', '2) Elliot had voted for River in Day 2, and was immediately killed that night—mafia often eliminate the one who directly accused them.  \n', '3) In discussion, Tyler repeatedly steered the group toward broad “watch-everyone” deflections without naming concrete suspects, while River likewise cast votes (for Adrian Day 2) that helped eliminate another bystander.  \n', '4) Neither River nor Tyler was ever themselves targeted by suspicion or vote, consistent with mafia who both direct the vote elsewhere and avoid drawing attention to themselves.  \n', 'All other survivors either cast principled votes or were called out by multiple players and thus less likely to be the hidden killers.']

Game 0665, Day 3:
 Actual Mafia: River
Stevie 
 Reasoning and guess from observer: ['Mafia: Alex, River  \n', 'Reason:  \n', '1) Kill‐pattern vs. suspicions: on Night 2 the mafia murdered Elliot – the one player publicly calling out Alex and River (along with Brook) as prime suspects. Mafia typically silence those who’ve zeroed in on them.  \n', '2) Conversation steering: both Alex and River repeatedly led the narrative—deflecting, redirecting, and framing others—while never themselves coming under serious late‐game fire.  \n', '3) Survivors: after the last night kill of Tyler, only Alex and River remain unscathed alongside two bystanders, matching the rule that the game ends when mafia equal non‐mafia.  \n', 'All evidence points to Alex and River as the two mafia.']
