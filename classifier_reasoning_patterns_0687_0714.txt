Pattern 1: Self-Incriminating “Slips”  
Count: 6  
Reason and Evidence:  
The observer frequently flags players who inadvertently admit or joke about being mafia.  
  • Game 0693 Day 4: Natalie’s slip “Natalie can’t be trusted” was cited as a tell.  
  • Game 0708 Day 1 & Day 2: Elizabeth Saunders laughs about deaths and then says “I am” when prompted to confess as mafia.  
  • Game 0712 Day 1, Day 2 & Day 3: Amy Lewis sarcastically declares “yeah I’m mafia vote for me,” a reverse-psychology slip that the observer treats as genuine.  

Pattern 2: Voting Coordination & Mutual Protection  
Count: 9  
Reason and Evidence:  
When two players consistently back each other’s votes or avoid voting for one another, the observer sees this as mafia collusion.  
  • Game 0700 Day 3: Kevin Hodge and Sara Bright vote together in key rounds to eliminate bystanders.  
  • Game 0704 Day 3: Ryan Russell and Jon Gutierrez both vote for Joshua Herman and later for the same suspect, showing tight coordination.  
  • Game 0706 Day 3: James Lamb and Eric Fisher repeatedly align their votes, switching targets together to sow confusion.  
  • Game 0708 Day 1 & Day 2: Elizabeth and Mariah “wink” alliance and vote in tandem, each defending or deflecting for the other.  
  • Game 0711 Day 1: Cody Garner and Tiffany Hill each vote to eliminate those who voted for their partner.  
  • Game 0712 Day 1, Day 2 & Day 3: Amy Lewis and Riley Webster never vote for each other and coordinate votes to remove their accusers.  

Pattern 3: Night-Kill Alignment with Daytime Suspicions  
Count: 6  
Reason and Evidence:  
The observer notes when a player who suspects or votes against someone is killed overnight, interpreting it as mafia retaliation.  
  • Game 0693 Day 4: Aaron Vaughan votes against Kevin Morales and is killed that night.  
  • Game 0700 Day 3: Players who voted against Kevin Hodge or Sara Bright (e.g., Terri Brewer) are the next night’s victims.  
  • Game 0706 Day 3: Rachael Cunningham observes voting patterns and is then eliminated at night.  
  • Game 0711 Day 1: Jose Gonzalez’s last vote is for Cody Garner; he’s killed at night.  
  • Game 0712 Day 2 & Day 3: Accusers Jamie Sanchez and Damon Ryan are executed overnight after targeting Amy Lewis or Riley Webster.  

Pattern 4: Erratic or Non-Majority Voting to Misdirect  
Count: 2  
Reason and Evidence:  
Mafia members sometimes vote outside the prevailing consensus to avoid revealing alliances. The observer marks this as suspicious.  
  • Game 0700 Day 3: Sara Bright’s votes swing unpredictably (Timothy Cherry, then Scott Nelson, then Sandra Robinson) rather than following a majority.  
  • Game 0706 Day 3: James Lamb shifts votes from James Martin to Lori Solomon to Maxwell Reyes, a pattern the observer calls strategic confusion.
